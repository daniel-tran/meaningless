1 John:
  5:
    1: '¹ Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone
      who loves the father loves his child as well. '
    2: '² This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and
      carrying out his commands. '
    3: '³ In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are
      not burdensome, '
    4: '⁴ for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has
      overcome the world, even our faith. '
    5: "⁵ Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus\
      \ is the Son of God. \n"
    6: '⁶ This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come
      by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because
      the Spirit is the truth. '
    7: '⁷ For there are three that testify: '
    8: '⁸ the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. '
    9: '⁹ We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is
      the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does
      not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed
      the testimony God has given about his Son. '
    11: '¹¹ And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life
      is in his Son. '
    12: "¹² Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does\
      \ not have life. \n"
    13: '¹³ I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God
      so that you may know that you have eternal life. '
    14: '¹⁴ This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything
      according to his will, he hears us. '
    15: "¹⁵ And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what\
      \ we asked of him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death,
      you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does
      not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that
      you should pray about that. '
    17: "¹⁷ All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who
      was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. '
    19: '¹⁹ We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under
      the control of the evil one. '
    20: "²⁰ We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding,\
      \ so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being\
      \ in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. \n"
    21: ²¹ Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
