1 John:
  1:
    1: '¹ That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which
      we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning
      the Word of life '
    2: '² (and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to
      you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed
      to us); '
    3: '³ that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have
      fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his
      Son, Jesus Christ. '
    4: "⁴ And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled. \n"
    5: '⁵ This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that
      God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. '
    6: '⁶ If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we
      lie, and don’t tell the truth. '
    7: '⁷ But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with
      one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. '
    8: '⁸ If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
      in us. '
    9: '⁹ If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins,
      and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. '
    10: ¹⁰ If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not
      in us.
  2:
    1: '¹ My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.
      If anyone sins, we have a Counselor with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. '
    2: '² And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but
      also for the whole world. '
    3: '³ This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. '
    4: '⁴ One who says, “I know him,” and doesn’t keep his commandments, is a liar,
      and the truth isn’t in him. '
    5: '⁵ But God’s love has most certainly been perfected in whoever keeps his word.
      This is how we know that we are in him: '
    6: "⁶ he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.
      \n"
    7: '⁷ Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which
      you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard
      from the beginning. '
    8: '⁸ Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you;
      because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines. '
    9: '⁹ He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness
      even until now. '
    10: '¹⁰ He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion
      for stumbling in him. '
    11: "¹¹ But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness,
      and doesn’t know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
      \n"
    12: "¹² I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for
      his name’s sake. \n"
    13: "¹³ I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.\n
      I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.\nI write
      to you, little children, because you know the Father. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.\n
      I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God
      remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Don’t love the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves
      the world, the Father’s love isn’t in him. '
    16: '¹⁶ For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
      and the pride of life, isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s. '
    17: "¹⁷ The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God’s will remains
      forever. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist
      is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is
      the final hour. '
    19: '¹⁹ They went out from us, but they didn’t belong to us; for if they had belonged
      to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be
      revealed that none of them belong to us. '
    20: '²⁰ You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. '
    21: '²¹ I have not written to you because you don’t know the truth, but because
      you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. '
    22: '²² Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the
      Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. '
    23: "²³ Whoever denies the Son doesn’t have the Father. He who confesses the Son
      has the Father also. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the
      beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also
      will remain in the Son, and in the Father. '
    25: '²⁵ This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life. '
    26: '²⁶ These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you
      astray. '
    27: '²⁷ As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you,
      and you don’t need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you
      concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you,
      you will remain in him. '
    28: '²⁸ Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have
      boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. '
    29: ²⁹ If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices
      righteousness has been born of him.
  3:
    1: '¹ See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called
      children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t
      know him. '
    2: '² Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will
      be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see
      him just as he is. '
    3: '³ Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure. '
    4: '⁴ Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. '
    5: '⁵ You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him. '
    6: "⁶ Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t
      know him. \n"
    7: '⁷ Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is
      righteous, even as he is righteous. '
    8: '⁸ He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
      To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of
      the devil. '
    9: '⁹ Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him,
      and he can’t sin, because he is born of God. '
    10: '¹⁰ In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.
      Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love
      his brother. '
    11: '¹¹ For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should
      love one another; '
    12: "¹² unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did
      he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s righteous. \n"
    13: '¹³ Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you. '
    14: '¹⁴ We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the
      brothers. He who doesn’t love his brother remains in death. '
    15: "¹⁵ Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer
      has eternal life remaining in him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought
      to lay down our lives for the brothers. '
    17: '¹⁷ But whoever has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, then closes
      his heart of compassion against him, how does God’s love remain in him? '
    18: '¹⁸ My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only,
      but in deed and truth. '
    19: '¹⁹ And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts
      before him, '
    20: '²⁰ because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows
      all things. '
    21: '²¹ Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God; '
    22: '²² so whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments
      and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. '
    23: '²³ This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son,
      Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded. '
    24: ²⁴ He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we
      know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
