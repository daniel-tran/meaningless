Do not keep silent, O God;
Do not hold Your peace or be still, O God.
² For behold, Your enemies are in tumult,
And those who hate You have raised their heads [in hatred of You].
³ They concoct crafty schemes against Your people,
And conspire together against Your hidden and precious ones.
⁴ They have said, “Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation;
Let the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
⁵ For they have conspired together with one mind;
Against You they make a covenant—
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Of Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Assyria also has joined with them;
They have helped the children of Lot [the Ammonites and the Moabites] and have been an arm [of strength] to them. Selah. 
⁹ Deal with them as [You did] with Midian,
As with Sisera and Jabin at the brook of Kishon,
¹⁰ Who were destroyed at En-dor,
Who became like dung for the earth.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb
And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² Who said, “Let us possess for ourselves
The pastures of God.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like whirling dust,
Like chaff before the wind [worthless and without substance].
¹⁴ Like fire consumes the forest,
And like the flame sets the mountains on fire,
¹⁵ So pursue them with Your tempest
And terrify them with [the violence of] Your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame and disgrace,
That they may [persistently] seek Your name, O Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever;
Yes, let them be humiliated and perish,
¹⁸ That they may know that You alone, whose name is the Lord,
Are the Most High over all the earth.
