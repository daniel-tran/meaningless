¹ God, do not keep silent.
Do not be deaf, God; do not be quiet.
² See how your enemies make an uproar;
those who hate you have acted arrogantly.
³ They devise clever schemes against your people;
they conspire against your treasured ones.
⁴ They say, “Come, let’s wipe them out as a nation
so that Israel’s name will no longer be remembered.”
⁵ For they have conspired with one mind;
they form an alliance against you—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Even Assyria has joined them;
they lend support to the sons of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Deal with them as you did with Midian,
as you did with Sisera
and Jabin at the Kishon River.
¹⁰ They were destroyed at En-dor;
they became manure for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let’s seize God’s pastures for ourselves.” 
¹³ Make them like tumbleweed, my God,
like straw before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire burns a forest,
as a flame blazes through mountains,
¹⁵ so pursue them with your tempest
and terrify them with your storm.
¹⁶ Cover their faces with shame
so that they will seek your name, Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and terrified forever;
let them perish in disgrace.
¹⁸ May they know that you alone—
whose name is the Lord—
are the Most High over the whole earth.
