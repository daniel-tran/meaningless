O God, do not keep silence;
do not hold thy peace or be still, O God!
² For lo, thy enemies are in tumult;
    those who hate thee have raised their heads.
³ They lay crafty plans against thy people;
    they consult together against thy protected ones.
⁴ They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
    let the name of Israel be remembered no more!”
⁵ Yea, they conspire with one accord;
    against thee they make a covenant—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ish′maelites,
    Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Am′alek,
    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also has joined them;
    they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Do to them as thou didst to Mid′ian,
    as to Sis′era and Jabin at the river Kishon,
¹⁰ who were destroyed at En-dor,
    who became dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmun′na,
¹² who said, “Let us take possession for ourselves
    of the pastures of God.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like whirling dust,
    like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire consumes the forest,
    as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
¹⁵ so do thou pursue them with thy tempest
    and terrify them with thy hurricane!
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame,
    that they may seek thy name, O Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
    let them perish in disgrace.
¹⁸ Let them know that thou alone,
    whose name is the Lord,
    art the Most High over all the earth.
