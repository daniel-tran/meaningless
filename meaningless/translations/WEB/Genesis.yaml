Genesis:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. '
    2: "² The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep\
      \ and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters. \n"
    3: '³ God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. '
    4: '⁴ God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from
      the darkness. '
    5: "⁵ God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was\
      \ evening and there was morning, the first day. \n"
    6: '⁶ God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let
      it divide the waters from the waters.” '
    7: '⁷ God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse
      from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. '
    8: "⁸ God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a\
      \ second day. \n"
    9: '⁹ God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place,
      and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. '
    10: '¹⁰ God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters
      he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. '
    11: '¹¹ God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit
      trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;”
      and it was so. '
    12: '¹² The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees
      bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it
      was good. '
    13: "¹³ There was evening and there was morning, a third day. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the
      day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; '
    15: '¹⁵ and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on
      the earth;” and it was so. '
    16: '¹⁶ God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and
      the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. '
    17: '¹⁷ God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, '
    18: '¹⁸ and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
      the darkness. God saw that it was good. '
    19: "¹⁹ There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. \n"
    20: '²⁰ God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds
      fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” '
    21: '²¹ God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves,
      with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after
      its kind. God saw that it was good. '
    22: '²² God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters
      in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” '
    23: "²³ There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. \n"
    24: '²⁴ God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock,
      creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. '
    25: "²⁵ God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock\
      \ after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind.\
      \ God saw that it was good. \n"
    26: '²⁶ God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have
      dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the
      livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps
      on the earth.” '
    27: '²⁷ God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male
      and female he created them. '
    28: '²⁸ God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth,
      and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the
      sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” '
    29: '²⁹ God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is
      on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding
      seed. It will be your food. '
    30: "³⁰ To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything\
      \ that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green\
      \ herb for food;” and it was so. \n"
    31: ³¹ God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There
      was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
  2:
    1: '¹ The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. '
    2: '² On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested
      on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. '
    3: "³ God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from\
      \ all his work of creation which he had done. \n"
    4: '⁴ This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
      they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens. '
    5: '⁵ No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had
      yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There
      was not a man to till the ground, '
    6: '⁶ but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the
      ground. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
      nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. '
    8: '⁸ Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man
      whom he had formed. '
    9: '⁹ Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to
      the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the
      garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. '
    10: '¹⁰ A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted,
      and became the source of four rivers. '
    11: '¹¹ The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah,
      where there is gold; '
    12: '¹² and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there. '
    13: '¹³ The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows
      through the whole land of Cush. '
    14: '¹⁴ The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in
      front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate
      and keep it. '
    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree
      of the garden; '
    17: "¹⁷ but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for\
      \ in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make
      him a helper comparable to him.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every
      bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
      Whatever the man called every living creature became its name. '
    20: '²⁰ The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and
      to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable
      to him. '
    21: '²¹ Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept,
      he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. '
    22: '²² Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man,
      and brought her to the man. '
    23: '²³ The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She
      will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” '
    24: '²⁴ Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with
      his wife, and they will be one flesh. '
    25: ²⁵ The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
  3:
    1: "¹ Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh\
      \ God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat\
      \ of any tree of the garden’?” \n"
    2: '² The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, '
    3: "³ but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God\
      \ has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die, '
    5: "⁵ for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and\
      \ you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight
      to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took
      some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and
      he ate it, too. '
    7: '⁷ Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed
      fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves. '
    8: "⁸ They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day,\
      \ and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among\
      \ the trees of the garden. \n"
    9: "⁹ Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because\
      \ I was naked; so I hid myself.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree\
      \ that I commanded you not to eat from?” \n"
    12: "¹² The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit\
      \ from the tree, and I ate it.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”\nThe woman said, “The\
      \ serpent deceived me, and I ate.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yahweh God said to the serpent,\n“Because you have done this,\n    you\
      \ are cursed above all livestock,\n    and above every animal of the field.\n\
      You shall go on your belly\n    and you shall eat dust all the days of your\
      \ life.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will put hostility between you and the woman,\n    and between your\
      \ offspring and her offspring.\nHe will bruise your head,\n    and you will\
      \ bruise his heel.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ To the woman he said,\n“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.\n\
      \    You will bear children in pain.\nYour desire will be for your husband,\n\
      \    and he will rule over you.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ To Adam he said,\n“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,\n \
      \   and have eaten from the tree,\n    about which I commanded you, saying,\
      \ ‘You shall not eat of it,’\n    the ground is cursed for your sake.\nYou will\
      \ eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.\n"
    18: "¹⁸     It will yield thorns and thistles to you;\n    and you will eat the\
      \ herb of the field.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,\n\
      \    for you were taken out of it.\nFor you are dust,\n    and you shall return\
      \ to dust.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the
      living. '
    21: "²¹ Yahweh God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and\
      \ clothed them. \n"
    22: '²² Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good
      and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life,
      and eat, and live forever—” '
    23: '²³ Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the
      ground from which he was taken. '
    24: ²⁴ So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden
      of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the
      tree of life.
  4:
    1: '¹ The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said,
      “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.” '
    2: '² Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep,
      but Cain was a tiller of the ground. '
    3: '³ As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the
      ground. '
    4: '⁴ Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh
      respected Abel and his offering, '
    5: '⁵ but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the
      expression on his face fell. '
    6: '⁶ Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your
      face fallen? '
    7: '⁷ If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches
      at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” '
    8: "⁸ Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were\
      \ in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. \n"
    9: "⁹ Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”\nHe said, “I don’t know.\
      \ Am I my brother’s keeper?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries
      to me from the ground. '
    11: '¹¹ Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to
      receive your brother’s blood from your hand. '
    12: "¹² From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to\
      \ you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. '
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I\
      \ will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in\
      \ the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken\
      \ on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding\
      \ him would not strike him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. '
    17: '¹⁷ Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a
      city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. '
    18: '¹⁸ Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became
      the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. '
    19: '¹⁹ Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name
      of the second one was Zillah. '
    20: '²⁰ Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents
      and have livestock. '
    21: '²¹ His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the
      harp and pipe. '
    22: '²² Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument
      of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah. '
    23: "²³ Lamech said to his wives,\n“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.\n    You wives\
      \ of Lamech, listen to my speech,\nfor I have slain a man for wounding me,\n\
      \    a young man for bruising me.\n"
    24: "²⁴ If Cain will be avenged seven times,\n    truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth,
      saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed
      him.” '
    26: ²⁶ A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began
      to call on Yahweh’s name.
  5:
    1: '¹ This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created
      man, he made him in God’s likeness. '
    2: '² He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were
      created, he named them Adam. '
    3: '³ Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his
      own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. '
    4: '⁴ The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years,
      and he became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    5: "⁵ All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Seth lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh. '
    7: '⁷ Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years,
      and became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    8: "⁸ All of the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died. \n"
    9: '⁹ Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. '
    10: '¹⁰ Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan eight hundred fifteen
      years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    11: "¹¹ All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died. \n"
    12: '¹² Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel. '
    13: '¹³ Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty
      years, and became the father of other sons and daughters '
    14: "¹⁴ and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared. '
    16: '¹⁶ Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty
      years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    17: "¹⁷ All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then\
      \ he died. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch. '
    19: '¹⁹ Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and
      became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    20: "²⁰ All of the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah. '
    22: '²² After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years,
      and became the father of more sons and daughters. '
    23: '²³ All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. '
    24: "²⁴ Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, then became the father
      of Lamech. '
    26: '²⁶ Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two
      years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    27: "²⁷ All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he\
      \ died. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, then became the father of a
      son. '
    29: '²⁹ He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in
      the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which Yahweh has cursed.” '
    30: '³⁰ Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five
      years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. '
    31: "³¹ All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he\
      \ died. \n"
    32: ³² Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham,
      and Japheth.
  6:
    1: '¹ When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were
      born to them, '
    2: '² God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that
      they wanted for themselves as wives. '
    3: '³ Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also
      is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.” '
    4: "⁴ The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when\
      \ God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were\
      \ the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
      imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil. '
    6: '⁶ Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in
      his heart. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of
      the ground—man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky—for
      I am sorry that I have made them.” '
    8: "⁸ But Noah found favor in Yahweh’s eyes. \n"
    9: '⁹ This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man,
      blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God. '
    10: '¹⁰ Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. '
    11: '¹¹ The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. '
    12: "¹² God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted\
      \ their way on the earth. \n"
    13: '¹³ God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is
      filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth. '
    14: '¹⁴ Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall
      seal it inside and outside with pitch. '
    15: '¹⁵ This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred
      cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit
      upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with
      lower, second, and third levels. '
    17: '¹⁷ I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all
      flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the
      earth will die. '
    18: '¹⁸ But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship,
      you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. '
    19: '¹⁹ Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort
      into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. '
    20: '²⁰ Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every
      creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to
      you, to keep them alive. '
    21: '²¹ Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself;
      and it will be for food for you, and for them.” '
    22: ²² Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him.
  7:
    1: '¹ Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for
      I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation. '
    2: '² You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and
      his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. '
    3: '³ Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep
      seed alive on the surface of all the earth. '
    4: "⁴ In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty\
      \ nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface\
      \ of the ground.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him. \n"
    6: '⁶ Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. '
    7: '⁷ Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because
      of the floodwaters. '
    8: '⁸ Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the
      ground '
    9: '⁹ went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. '
    10: '¹⁰ After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the
      seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep
      burst open, and the sky’s windows opened. '
    12: "¹² It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights. \n"
    13: '¹³ In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and
      Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship— '
    14: '¹⁴ they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind,
      every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird
      after its kind, every bird of every sort. '
    15: '¹⁵ Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship
      to Noah. '
    16: '¹⁶ Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded
      him; then Yahweh shut him in. '
    17: '¹⁷ The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted
      up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated
      on the surface of the waters. '
    19: '¹⁹ The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were
      under the whole sky were covered. '
    20: '²⁰ The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered. '
    21: '²¹ All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals,
      every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. '
    22: '²² All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of
      life, died. '
    23: '²³ Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground,
      including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed
      from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. '
    24: ²⁴ The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
  8:
    1: '¹ God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with
      him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. '
    2: '² The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain
      from the sky was restrained. '
    3: '³ The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred
      fifty days the waters receded. '
    4: '⁴ The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
      on Ararat’s mountains. '
    5: "⁵ The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month,\
      \ on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible. \n"
    6: '⁶ At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had
      made, '
    7: '⁷ and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried
      up from the earth. '
    8: '⁸ He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface
      of the ground, '
    9: '⁹ but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the
      ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out
      his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship. '
    10: '¹⁰ He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the
      ship. '
    11: '¹¹ The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly
      plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. '
    12: "¹² He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t\
      \ return to him any more. \n"
    13: '¹³ In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the
      month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of
      the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dry. '
    14: "¹⁴ In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth\
      \ was dry. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ God spoke to Noah, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with
      you. '
    17: "¹⁷ Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including\
      \ birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that\
      \ they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the\
      \ earth.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. '
    19: "¹⁹ Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on\
      \ the earth, after their families, went out of the ship. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of
      every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. '
    21: '²¹ Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not
      again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s
      heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing,
      as I have done. '
    22: ²² While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and
      summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”
  9:
    1: '¹ God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply,
      and replenish the earth. '
    2: '² The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth,
      and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all
      the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand. '
    3: '³ Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green
      herb, I have given everything to you. '
    4: '⁴ But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat. '
    5: '⁵ I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every
      animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s
      brother, I will require the life of man. '
    6: '⁶ Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man
      in his own image. '
    7: "⁷ Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply\
      \ in it.” \n"
    8: '⁸ God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring
      after you, '
    10: '¹⁰ and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock,
      and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even
      every animal of the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any
      more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy
      the earth.” '
    12: '¹² God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and
      you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: '
    13: '¹³ I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between
      me and the earth. '
    14: '¹⁴ When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in
      the cloud, '
    15: '¹⁵ I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living
      creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy
      all flesh. '
    16: '¹⁶ The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember
      the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh
      that is on the earth.” '
    17: "¹⁷ God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established\
      \ between me and all flesh that is on the earth.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
      Ham is the father of Canaan. '
    19: "¹⁹ These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was\
      \ populated. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. '
    21: '²¹ He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. '
    22: '²² Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his
      two brothers outside. '
    23: '²³ Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders,
      went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were
      backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness. '
    24: '²⁴ Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him. '
    25: "²⁵ He said,\n“Canaan is cursed.\n    He will be a servant of servants to\
      \ his brothers.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ He said,\n“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.\n    Let Canaan be his\
      \ servant.\n"
    27: "²⁷ May God enlarge Japheth.\n    Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.\n  \
      \  Let Canaan be his servant.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood. '
    29: ²⁹ All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died.
  10:
    1: "¹ Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem,\
      \ Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood. \n"
    2: '² The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and
      Tiras. '
    3: '³ The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. '
    4: '⁴ The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. '
    5: "⁵ Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone\
      \ after his language, after their families, in their nations. \n"
    6: '⁶ The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons
      of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan. '
    8: '⁸ Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. '
    9: '⁹ He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod,
      a mighty hunter before Yahweh”. '
    10: '¹⁰ The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the
      land of Shinar. '
    11: '¹¹ Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,
      Calah, '
    12: '¹² and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah. '
    13: '¹³ Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, '
    14: "¹⁴ Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, '
    16: '¹⁶ the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, '
    17: '¹⁷ the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, '
    18: '¹⁸ the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families
      of the Canaanites were spread abroad. '
    19: '¹⁹ The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to
      Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha. '
    20: "²⁰ These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages,\
      \ in their lands and their nations. \n"
    21: '²¹ Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father
      of all the children of Eber. '
    22: '²² The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. '
    24: '²⁴ Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. '
    25: '²⁵ To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his
      days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan. '
    26: '²⁶ Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, '
    27: '²⁷ Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, '
    28: '²⁸ Obal, Abimael, Sheba, '
    29: '²⁹ Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. '
    30: '³⁰ Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain
      of the east. '
    31: "³¹ These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages,\
      \ lands, and nations. \n"
    32: ³² These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according
      to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.
  11:
    1: '¹ The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. '
    2: '² As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they
      lived there. '
    3: '³ They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.”
      They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. '
    4: "⁴ They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches\
      \ to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad\
      \ on the surface of the whole earth.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men
      built. '
    6: '⁶ Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language,
      and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which
      they intend to do. '
    7: '⁷ Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not
      understand one another’s speech.” '
    8: '⁸ So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth.
      They stopped building the city. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language\
      \ of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface\
      \ of all the earth. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years
      old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. '
    11: "¹¹ Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    12: '¹² Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. '
    13: "¹³ Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of\
      \ Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber. '
    15: "¹⁵ Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. '
    17: "¹⁷ Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu. '
    19: "¹⁹ Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug. '
    21: "²¹ Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    22: '²² Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor. '
    23: "²³ Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and\
      \ became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah. '
    25: "²⁵ Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah,\
      \ and became the father of more sons and daughters. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and\
      \ Haran. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the
      father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. '
    28: '²⁸ Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his
      father Terah was still alive. '
    29: '²⁹ Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and
      the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the
      father of Iscah. '
    30: '³⁰ Sarai was barren. She had no child. '
    31: '³¹ Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai
      his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees,
      to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there. '
    32: ³² The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your
      father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you. '
    2: '² I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great.
      You will be a blessing. '
    3: "³ I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats you with\
      \ contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five
      years old when he departed from Haran. '
    5: '⁵ Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions
      that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and
      they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan. '
    6: "⁶ Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh.\
      \ At that time, Canaanites were in the land. \n"
    7: "⁷ Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.”\n\
      He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him. "
    8: '⁸ He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched
      his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar
      to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name. '
    9: "⁹ Abram traveled, still going on toward the South. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as
      a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land. '
    11: '¹¹ When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See
      now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at. '
    12: '¹² It will happen that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is
      his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive. '
    13: "¹³ Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your\
      \ sake, and that my soul may live because of you.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very
      beautiful. '
    15: '¹⁵ The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman
      was taken into Pharaoh’s house. '
    16: '¹⁶ He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys,
      male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. '
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai,
      Abram’s wife. '
    18: '¹⁸ Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me?
      Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife? '
    19: "¹⁹ Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife?\
      \ Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.” \n"
    20: ²⁰ Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his
      wife and all that he had.
  13:
    1: '¹ Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into
      the South. '
    2: '² Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. '
    3: '³ He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where
      his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, '
    4: '⁴ to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram
      called on Yahweh’s name. '
    5: '⁵ Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents. '
    6: '⁶ The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their
      possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together. '
    7: '⁷ There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen
      of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that
      time. '
    8: '⁸ Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and
      between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives. '
    9: "⁹ Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you\
      \ go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right\
      \ hand, then I will go to the left.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was
      well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the
      garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. '
    11: '¹¹ So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and
      they separated themselves from one other. '
    12: '¹² Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the
      plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. '
    13: "¹³ Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up
      your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and
      eastward and westward, '
    15: '¹⁵ for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring
      forever. '
    16: '¹⁶ I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man
      can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted. '
    17: "¹⁷ Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will\
      \ give it to you.” \n"
    18: ¹⁸ Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are
      in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.
  14:
    1: '¹ In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer,
      king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim, '
    2: '² they made war with Bera, king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab,
      king of Admah; Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (also called
      Zoar). '
    3: '³ All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt
      Sea). '
    4: '⁴ They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they
      rebelled. '
    5: '⁵ In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came
      and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh
      Kiriathaim, '
    6: '⁶ and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness. '
    7: '⁷ They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all
      the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon
      Tamar. '
    8: '⁸ The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king
      of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the
      battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim '
    9: '⁹ against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of
      Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom
      and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there. Those who remained fled to the hills. '
    11: '¹¹ They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and
      went their way. '
    12: "¹² They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods,\
      \ and departed. \n"
    13: '¹³ One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he
      lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner.
      They were allies of Abram. '
    14: '¹⁴ When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his three
      hundred eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as Dan. '
    15: '¹⁵ He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck
      them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. '
    16: "¹⁶ He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot\
      \ and his goods, and the women also, and the other people. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter
      of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that
      is, the King’s Valley). '
    18: '¹⁸ Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of
      God Most High. '
    19: '¹⁹ He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor
      of heaven and earth. '
    20: "²⁰ Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”\n\
      Abram gave him a tenth of all. \n"
    21: "²¹ The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods\
      \ for yourself.” \n"
    22: '²² Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh,
      God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, '
    23: '²³ that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is
      yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ '
    24: '²⁴ I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten,
      and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them
      take their portion.”'
  15:
    1: "¹ After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t\
      \ be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.” \n"
    2: '² Abram said, “Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and
      he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” '
    3: "³ Abram said, “Behold, you have given no children to me: and, behold, one\
      \ born in my house is my heir.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir,
      but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.” '
    5: '⁵ Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count
      the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So your offspring
      will be.” '
    6: '⁶ He believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness. '
    7: "⁷ He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees,\
      \ to give you this land to inherit it.” \n"
    8: "⁸ He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?” \n"
    9: '⁹ He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three
      years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” '
    10: '¹⁰ He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each
      half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds. '
    11: "¹¹ The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and
      great darkness fell on him. '
    13: '¹³ He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners
      in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four
      hundred years. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will
      come out with great wealth; '
    15: '¹⁵ but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good
      old age. '
    16: '¹⁶ In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of
      the Amorite is not yet full.” '
    17: '¹⁷ It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold,
      a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. '
    18: '¹⁸ In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this
      land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river
      Euphrates: '
    19: '¹⁹ the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, '
    20: '²⁰ the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, '
    21: ²¹ the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
  16:
    1: '¹ Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian,
      whose name was Hagar. '
    2: '² Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please
      go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened
      to the voice of Sarai. '
    3: '³ Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had
      lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to
      be his wife. '
    4: '⁴ He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived,
      her mistress was despised in her eyes. '
    5: "⁵ Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your\
      \ bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May Yahweh\
      \ judge between me and you.” \n"
    6: "⁶ But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever\
      \ is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her\
      \ face. \n"
    7: '⁷ Yahweh’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the
      fountain on the way to Shur. '
    8: "⁸ He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you\
      \ going?”\nShe said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself
      under her hands.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, that
      they will not be counted for multitude.” '
    11: '¹¹ Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear
      a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction. '
    12: "¹² He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every\
      \ man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposed to all of his\
      \ brothers.” \n"
    13: '¹³ She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,”
      for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?” '
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh\
      \ and Bered. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar
      bore, Ishmael. '
    16: ¹⁶ Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
  17:
    1: '¹ When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram and said
      to him, “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless. '
    2: "² I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a
      multitude of nations. '
    5: '⁵ Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for
      I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. '
    6: '⁶ I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings
      will come out of you. '
    7: '⁷ I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after
      you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to
      you and to your offspring after you. '
    8: "⁸ I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you\
      \ are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will\
      \ be their God.” \n"
    9: '⁹ God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your
      offspring after you throughout their generations. '
    10: '¹⁰ This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your
      offspring after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token
      of the covenant between me and you. '
    12: '¹² He who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout
      your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any
      foreigner who is not of your offspring. '
    13: '¹³ He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must
      be circumcised. My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. '
    14: "¹⁴ The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,\
      \ that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name
      Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah. '
    16: "¹⁶ I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will\
      \ bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come\
      \ from her.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will
      a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety
      years old, give birth?” '
    18: "¹⁸ Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ God said, “No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call
      his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant
      for his offspring after him. '
    20: '²⁰ As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will
      make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father
      of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. '
    21: "²¹ But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you\
      \ at this set time next year.” \n"
    22: '²² When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. '
    23: '²³ Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all
      who were bought with his money: every male among the men of Abraham’s house,
      and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said
      to him. '
    24: '²⁴ Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh
      of his foreskin. '
    25: '²⁵ Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the
      flesh of his foreskin. '
    26: '²⁶ In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. '
    27: ²⁷ All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with
      money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
  18:
    1: '¹ Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door
      in the heat of the day. '
    2: '² He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him.
      When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself
      to the earth, '
    3: '³ and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t
      go away from your servant. '
    4: '⁴ Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under
      the tree. '
    5: "⁵ I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you\
      \ may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.”\nThey said, “Very\
      \ well, do as you have said.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three
      seahs of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.” '
    7: '⁷ Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it
      to the servant. He hurried to dress it. '
    8: "⁸ He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before\
      \ them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate. \n"
    9: "⁹ They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”\nHe said, “There, in the tent.”\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year;\
      \ and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.”\nSarah heard in the tent door,\
      \ which was behind him. "
    11: '¹¹ Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed
      the age of childbearing. '
    12: "¹² Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have\
      \ pleasure, my lord being old also?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear
      a child when I am old?’ '
    14: "¹⁴ Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you,\
      \ when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.\n\
      He said, “No, but you did laugh.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with
      them to see them on their way. '
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do, '
    18: '¹⁸ since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the
      nations of the earth will be blessed in him? '
    19: '¹⁹ For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and
      his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness
      and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken
      of him.” '
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because
      their sin is very grievous, '
    21: "²¹ I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports\
      \ which have come to me. If not, I will know.” \n"
    22: '²² The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet
      before Yahweh. '
    23: '²³ Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the
      wicked? '
    24: '²⁴ What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and
      not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? '
    25: "²⁵ May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with\
      \ the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far\
      \ from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then
      I will spare the whole place for their sake.” '
    27: '²⁷ Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the
      Lord, although I am dust and ashes. '
    28: "²⁸ What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy\
      \ all the city for lack of five?”\nHe said, “I will not destroy it if I find\
      \ forty-five there.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”\n\
      He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there\
      \ are thirty found there?”\nHe said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What\
      \ if there are twenty found there?”\nHe said, “I will not destroy it for the\
      \ twenty’s sake.” \n"
    32: "³² He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more.\
      \ What if ten are found there?”\nHe said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s\
      \ sake.” \n"
    33: ³³ Yahweh went his way as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham,
      and Abraham returned to his place.
  19:
    1: '¹ The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot
      saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, '
    2: "² and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house,\
      \ stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your\
      \ way.”\nThey said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.” \n"
    3: '³ He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house.
      He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. '
    4: '⁴ But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded
      the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. '
    5: "⁵ They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you\
      \ this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself. '
    7: '⁷ He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly. '
    8: "⁸ See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you,\
      \ and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these\
      \ men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.” \n"
    9: '⁹ They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live
      as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with
      you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break
      the door. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to
      them, and shut the door. '
    11: "¹¹ They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness,\
      \ both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door. \n"
    12: '¹² The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your
      sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the
      place: '
    13: "¹³ for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown\
      \ so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry\
      \ his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy\
      \ the city!”\nBut he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. "
    15: '¹⁵ When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take
      your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity
      of the city.” '
    16: '¹⁶ But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his
      two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and
      set him outside of the city. '
    17: "¹⁷ It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for\
      \ your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape\
      \ to the mountains, lest you be consumed!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified
      your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t
      escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. '
    20: "²⁰ See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let\
      \ me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.” \n"
    21: '²¹ He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing
      also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. '
    22: "²² Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore\
      \ the name of the city was called Zoar. \n"
    23: '²³ The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. '
    24: '²⁴ Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh
      out of the sky. '
    25: '²⁵ He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities,
      and that which grew on the ground. '
    26: "²⁶ But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of\
      \ salt. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before
      Yahweh. '
    28: "²⁸ He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain,\
      \ and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. \n"
    29: "²⁹ When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and\
      \ sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities\
      \ in which Lot lived. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters
      with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two
      daughters. '
    31: '³¹ The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not
      a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. '
    32: '³² Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that
      we may preserve our father’s family line.” '
    33: '³³ They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in,
      and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. '
    34: '³⁴ It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger,
      “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight.
      You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” '
    35: '³⁵ They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and
      lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up. '
    36: '³⁶ Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father. '
    37: '³⁷ The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the
      Moabites to this day. '
    38: ³⁸ The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father
      of the children of Ammon to this day.
  20:
    1: '¹ Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between
      Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. '
    2: '² Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of
      Gerar sent, and took Sarah. '
    3: "³ But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold,\
      \ you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a\
      \ man’s wife.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even
      a righteous nation? '
    5: "⁵ Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He\
      \ is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence\
      \ of my hands.” \n"
    6: '⁶ God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your
      heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore
      I didn’t allow you to touch her. '
    7: "⁷ Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will\
      \ pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that\
      \ you will die, you, and all who are yours.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told
      all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. '
    9: '⁹ Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us?
      How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom
      a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!” '
    10: "¹⁰ Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this\
      \ thing?” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this
      place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’ '
    12: '¹² Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the
      daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. '
    13: "¹³ When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This\
      \ is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of\
      \ me, “He is my brother.”’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and
      gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases
      you.” '
    16: "¹⁶ To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces\
      \ of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with\
      \ you. In front of all you are vindicated.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female
      servants, and they bore children. '
    18: ¹⁸ For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,
      because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
  21:
    1: '¹ Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken. '
    2: '² Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time
      of which God had spoken to him. '
    3: '³ Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. '
    4: '⁴ Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had
      commanded him. '
    5: '⁵ Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. '
    6: '⁶ Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” '
    7: "⁷ She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?\
      \ For I have borne him a son in his old age.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that
      Isaac was weaned. '
    9: '⁹ Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham,
      mocking. '
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For\
      \ the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. '
    12: '¹² God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of
      the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen
      to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac. '
    13: '¹³ I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your
      child.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of
      water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child,
      and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. '
    15: '¹⁵ The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one
      of the shrubs. '
    16: '¹⁶ She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away.
      For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him,
      and lifted up her voice, and wept. '
    17: "¹⁷ God heard the voice of the boy.\nThe angel of God called to Hagar out\
      \ of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For\
      \ God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. "
    18: "¹⁸ Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make\
      \ him a great nation.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the\
      \ container with water, and gave the boy a drink. \n"
    20: '²⁰ God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as
      he grew up, he became an archer. '
    21: "²¹ He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out\
      \ of the land of Egypt. \n"
    22: '²² At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham,
      saying, “God is with you in all that you do. '
    23: "²³ Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely\
      \ with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness\
      \ that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you\
      \ have lived as a foreigner.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Abraham said, “I will swear.” '
    25: '²⁵ Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s
      servants had violently taken away. '
    26: "²⁶ Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell\
      \ me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made
      a covenant. '
    28: '²⁸ Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. '
    29: "²⁹ Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have\
      \ set by themselves, mean?” \n"
    30: '³⁰ He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may
      be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.” '
    31: '³¹ Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore an oath
      there. '
    32: '³² So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the
      captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. '
    33: '³³ Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the
      name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God. '
    34: ³⁴ Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
  22:
    1: "¹ After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”\nHe\
      \ said, “Here I am.” \n"
    2: "² He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go\
      \ into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the\
      \ mountains which I will tell you of.” \n"
    3: '³ Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two
      of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt
      offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. '
    4: '⁴ On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. '
    5: '⁵ Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I
      will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.” '
    6: '⁶ Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son.
      He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. '
    7: "⁷ Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?”\nHe said, “Here\
      \ I am, my son.”\nHe said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the\
      \ lamb for a burnt offering?” \n"
    8: '⁸ Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my
      son.” So they both went together. '
    9: '⁹ They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar
      there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the
      altar, on the wood. '
    10: "¹⁰ Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”\n\
      He said, “Here I am.” \n"
    12: "¹² He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now\
      \ I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only\
      \ son, from me.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a
      ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered
      him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. '
    14: "¹⁴ Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh Will Provide”. As it is\
      \ said to this day, “On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, '
    16: '¹⁶ and said, “‘I have sworn by myself,’ says Yahweh, ‘because you have done
      this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, '
    17: '¹⁷ that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly
      like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your
      offspring will possess the gate of his enemies. '
    18: "¹⁸ All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because\
      \ you have obeyed my voice.’” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together\
      \ to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba. \n"
    20: '²⁰ After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne
      children to your brother Nahor: '
    21: '²¹ Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, '
    22: '²² Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” '
    23: '²³ Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor,
      Abraham’s brother. '
    24: ²⁴ His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and
      Maacah.
  23:
    1: '¹ Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s
      life. '
    2: '² Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
      Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. '
    3: '³ Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth,
      saying, '
    4: "⁴ “I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of\
      \ a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” \n"
    5: '⁵ The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, '
    6: "⁶ “Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the\
      \ best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children
      of Heth. '
    8: '⁸ He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out
      of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, '
    9: "⁹ that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the\
      \ end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me among you as a\
      \ possession for a burial place.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the
      Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all
      who went in at the gate of his city, saying, '
    11: "¹¹ “No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that\
      \ is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury\
      \ your dead.” \n"
    12: '¹² Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. '
    13: "¹³ He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying,\
      \ “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take\
      \ it from me, and I will bury my dead there.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, '
    15: "¹⁵ “My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels\
      \ of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which\
      \ he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels\
      \ of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre,
      the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field,
      that were in all of its borders, were deeded '
    18: '¹⁸ to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before
      all who went in at the gate of his city. '
    19: '¹⁹ After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of
      Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. '
    20: ²⁰ The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children
      of Heth as a possession for a burial place.
  24:
    1: '¹ Abraham was old, and well advanced in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in
      all things. '
    2: '² Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all
      that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh. '
    3: '³ I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth,
      that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
      among whom I live. '
    4: "⁴ But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for\
      \ my son Isaac.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to\
      \ this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house, and from the
      land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give
      this land to your offspring—he will send his angel before you, and you shall
      take a wife for my son from there. '
    8: "⁸ If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this\
      \ oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.” \n"
    9: '⁹ The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore
      to him concerning this matter. '
    10: '¹⁰ The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety
      of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia,
      to the city of Nahor. '
    11: '¹¹ He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at
      the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. '
    12: '¹² He said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success
      today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. '
    13: '¹³ Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men
      of the city are coming out to draw water. '
    14: "¹⁴ Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down\
      \ your pitcher, that I may drink,’ then she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give\
      \ your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant\
      \ Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born
      to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her
      pitcher on her shoulder. '
    16: '¹⁶ The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known
      her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. '
    17: "¹⁷ The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little\
      \ water from your pitcher.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her
      hand, and gave him a drink. '
    19: '¹⁹ When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw
      for your camels, until they have finished drinking.” '
    20: "²⁰ She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to\
      \ the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. \n"
    21: '²¹ The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh
      had made his journey prosperous or not. '
    22: '²² As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a
      shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, '
    23: "²³ and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your\
      \ father’s house for us to stay?” \n"
    24: '²⁴ She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom
      she bore to Nahor.” '
    25: "²⁵ She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room\
      \ to lodge in.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh. '
    27: "²⁷ He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not\
      \ forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh\
      \ has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. '
    29: '²⁹ Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man,
      to the spring. '
    30: '³⁰ When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when
      he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said
      to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. '
    31: "³¹ He said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For\
      \ I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.” \n"
    32: '³² The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw
      and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men
      who were with him. '
    33: "³³ Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have\
      \ told my message.”\nLaban said, “Speak on.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. '
    35: '³⁵ Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. Yahweh has
      given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants,
      and camels and donkeys. '
    36: '³⁶ Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He
      has given all that he has to him. '
    37: '³⁷ My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son
      from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, '
    38: '³⁸ but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a
      wife for my son.’ '
    39: '³⁹ I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ '
    40: '⁴⁰ He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you,
      and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and
      of my father’s house. '
    41: '⁴¹ Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If
      they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ '
    42: '⁴² I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham,
      if now you do prosper my way which I go— '
    43: '⁴³ behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the
      maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water
      from your pitcher to drink,” '
    44: '⁴⁴ then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let
      her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’ '
    45: '⁴⁵ Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with
      her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to
      her, ‘Please let me drink.’ '
    46: '⁴⁶ She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink,
      and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the
      camels a drink. '
    47: '⁴⁷ I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter
      of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose,
      and the bracelets on her hands. '
    48: '⁴⁸ I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of
      my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s
      daughter for his son. '
    49: "⁴⁹ Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not,\
      \ tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.” \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t
      speak to you bad or good. '
    51: "⁵¹ Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s\
      \ son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.” \n"
    52: '⁵² When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the
      earth to Yahweh. '
    53: '⁵³ The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing,
      and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her
      mother. '
    54: "⁵⁴ They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night.\
      \ They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.” \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few\
      \ days, at least ten. After that she will go.” \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way.\
      \ Send me away that I may go to my master.” \n"
    57: '⁵⁷ They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.” '
    58: "⁵⁸ They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”\nShe\
      \ said, “I will go.” \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant,
      and his men. '
    60: "⁶⁰ They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother\
      \ of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of\
      \ those who hate them.” \n"
    61: '⁶¹ Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the
      man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. '
    62: '⁶² Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of
      the South. '
    63: '⁶³ Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his
      eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming. '
    64: '⁶⁴ Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel. '
    65: "⁶⁵ She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to\
      \ meet us?”\nThe servant said, “It is my master.”\nShe took her veil, and covered\
      \ herself. "
    66: '⁶⁶ The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. '
    67: ⁶⁷ Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she
      became his wife. He loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
  25:
    1: '¹ Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. '
    2: '² She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. '
    3: '³ Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim,
      Letushim, and Leummim. '
    4: '⁴ The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these
      were the children of Keturah. '
    5: '⁵ Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac, '
    6: '⁶ but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still
      lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country. '
    7: '⁷ These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred
      seventy-five years. '
    8: '⁸ Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and
      full of years, and was gathered to his people. '
    9: '⁹ Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the
      field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre, '
    10: '¹⁰ the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was
      buried there with Sarah, his wife. '
    11: "¹¹ After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by\
      \ Beer Lahai Roi. \n"
    12: '¹² Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son,
      whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham. '
    13: '¹³ These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according
      to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar,
      Adbeel, Mibsam, '
    14: '¹⁴ Mishma, Dumah, Massa, '
    15: '¹⁵ Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. '
    16: '¹⁶ These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages,
      and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations. '
    17: '¹⁷ These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years.
      He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people. '
    18: "¹⁸ They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward\
      \ Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham
      became the father of Isaac. '
    20: '²⁰ Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel
      the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. '
    21: '²¹ Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was
      entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. '
    22: '²² The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this,
      why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh. '
    23: "²³ Yahweh said to her,\n“Two nations are in your womb.\nTwo peoples will\
      \ be separated from your body.\nThe one people will be stronger than the other\
      \ people.\nThe elder will serve the younger.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins
      in her womb. '
    25: '²⁵ The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him
      Esau. '
    26: "²⁶ After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel.\
      \ He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was
      a quiet man, living in tents. '
    28: '²⁸ Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. '
    29: '²⁹ Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. '
    30: "³⁰ Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I\
      \ am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom. \n"
    31: "³¹ Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.” \n"
    32: "³² Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to\
      \ me?” \n"
    33: "³³ Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”\nHe swore to him. He sold his birthright\
      \ to Jacob. "
    34: ³⁴ Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went
      his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
  26:
    1: '¹ There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was
      in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to
      Gerar. '
    2: '² Yahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the
      land I will tell you about. '
    3: '³ Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will
      give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the
      oath which I swore to Abraham your father. '
    4: '⁴ I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all
      these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth
      will be blessed, '
    5: "⁵ because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments,\
      \ my statutes, and my laws.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Isaac lived in Gerar. '
    7: '⁷ The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,”
      for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place
      might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” '
    8: '⁸ When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked
      out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. '
    9: "⁹ Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why\
      \ did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”\nIsaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest\
      \ I die because of her.’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might\
      \ easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or\
      \ his wife will surely be put to death.” \n"
    12: '¹² Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times
      what he planted. Yahweh blessed him. '
    13: '¹³ The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. '
    14: '¹⁴ He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household.
      The Philistines envied him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham
      his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. '
    16: "¹⁶ Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than\
      \ we.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived\
      \ there. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of
      Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of
      Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called
      them. '
    19: '¹⁹ Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing
      water. '
    20: '²⁰ The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water
      is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with
      him. '
    21: '²¹ They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. So he called its
      name Sitnah. '
    22: "²² He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that\
      \ one. So he called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Yahweh has made room for\
      \ us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” \n"
    23: '²³ He went up from there to Beersheba. '
    24: "²⁴ Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham\
      \ your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply\
      \ your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh’s name, and pitched his\
      \ tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol
      the captain of his army. '
    27: "²⁷ Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have\
      \ sent me away from you?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there
      now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant
      with you, '
    29: "²⁹ that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have\
      \ done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now\
      \ the blessed of Yahweh.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. '
    31: '³¹ They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another.
      Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. '
    32: '³² The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well
      which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” '
    33: "³³ He called it “Shibah”. Therefore the name of the city is “Beersheba” to\
      \ this day. \n"
    34: '³⁴ When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of
      Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. '
    35: ³⁵ They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.
  27:
    1: "¹ When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he\
      \ called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?”\nHe said to him, “Here\
      \ I am.” \n"
    2: '² He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death. '
    3: '³ Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go
      out to the field, and get me venison. '
    4: "⁴ Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat,\
      \ and that my soul may bless you before I die.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to
      hunt for venison, and to bring it. '
    6: '⁶ Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak
      to Esau your brother, saying, '
    7: '⁷ ‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you
      before Yahweh before my death.’ '
    8: '⁸ Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. '
    9: '⁹ Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make
      them savory food for your father, such as he loves. '
    10: "¹⁰ You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless\
      \ you before his death.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy
      man, and I am a smooth man. '
    12: "¹² What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I\
      \ would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.” \n"
    13: "¹³ His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my\
      \ voice, and go get them for me.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made
      savory food, such as his father loved. '
    15: '¹⁵ Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with
      her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. '
    16: '¹⁶ She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of
      his neck. '
    17: "¹⁷ She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the\
      \ hand of her son Jacob. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He came to his father, and said, “My father?”\nHe said, “Here I am. Who\
      \ are you, my son?” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what\
      \ you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul\
      \ may bless me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my\
      \ son?”\nHe said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.” \n"
    21: "²¹ Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether\
      \ you are really my son Esau or not.” \n"
    22: '²² Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice
      is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” '
    23: '²³ He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother
      Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. '
    24: "²⁴ He said, “Are you really my son Esau?”\nHe said, “I am.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that\
      \ my soul may bless you.”\nHe brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought\
      \ him wine, and he drank. "
    26: '²⁶ His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.” '
    27: "²⁷ He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and\
      \ blessed him, and said,\n“Behold, the smell of my son\n    is as the smell\
      \ of a field which Yahweh has blessed.\n"
    28: "²⁸ God give you of the dew of the sky,\n    of the fatness of the earth,\n\
      \    and plenty of grain and new wine.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let peoples serve you,\n    and nations bow down to you.\nBe lord over\
      \ your brothers.\n    Let your mother’s sons bow down to you.\nCursed be everyone\
      \ who curses you.\n    Blessed be everyone who blesses you.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone
      out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his
      hunting. '
    31: "³¹ He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his\
      \ father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul\
      \ may bless me.” \n"
    32: "³² Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?”\nHe said, “I am your son,\
      \ your firstborn, Esau.” \n"
    33: "³³ Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison,\
      \ and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed\
      \ him? Yes, he will be blessed.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly\
      \ great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my\
      \ father.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these\
      \ two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.”\
      \ He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?” \n"
    37: "³⁷ Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers\
      \ I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new\
      \ wine. What then will I do for you, my son?” \n"
    38: "³⁸ Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless\
      \ me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Isaac his father answered him,\n“Behold, your dwelling will be of the\
      \ fatness of the earth,\nand of the dew of the sky from above.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother.\nIt will\
      \ happen, when you will break loose,\nthat you will shake his yoke from off\
      \ your neck.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed\
      \ him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand.\
      \ Then I will kill my brother Jacob.” \n"
    42: '⁴² The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called
      Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts
      himself about you by planning to kill you. '
    43: '⁴³ Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother,
      in Haran. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away— '
    45: "⁴⁵ until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you\
      \ have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be\
      \ bereaved of you both in one day?” \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters
      of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the
      daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”
  28:
    1: '¹ Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take
      a wife of the daughters of Canaan. '
    2: '² Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father.
      Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. '
    3: '³ May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that
      you may be a company of peoples, '
    4: "⁴ and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with\
      \ you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the\
      \ Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram,
      to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command,
      saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;” '
    7: '⁷ and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan
      Aram. '
    8: '⁸ Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father. '
    9: "⁹ So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had,\
      \ Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to\
      \ be his wife. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. '
    11: '¹¹ He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun
      had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head,
      and lay down in that place to sleep. '
    12: '¹² He dreamed and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached
      to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. '
    13: '¹³ Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham
      your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and
      to your offspring. '
    14: '¹⁴ Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad
      to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and
      in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed. '
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring\
      \ you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that\
      \ which I have spoken of to you.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely Yahweh is in this
      place, and I didn’t know it.” '
    17: "¹⁷ He was afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other\
      \ than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put
      under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. '
    19: '¹⁹ He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was
      Luz at the first. '
    20: '²⁰ Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in
      this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, '
    21: '²¹ so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be
      my God, '
    22: ²² then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house.
      Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”
  29:
    1: '¹ Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of
      the east. '
    2: '² He looked, and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying
      there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the
      well’s mouth was large. '
    3: '³ There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s
      mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well’s mouth in
      its place. '
    4: "⁴ Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?”\nThey said, “We\
      \ are from Haran.” \n"
    5: "⁵ He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?”\nThey said, “We\
      \ know him.” \n"
    6: "⁶ He said to them, “Is it well with him?”\nThey said, “It is well. See, Rachel,\
      \ his daughter, is coming with the sheep.” \n"
    7: "⁷ He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather\
      \ the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.” \n"
    8: "⁸ They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they\
      \ roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.” \n"
    9: '⁹ While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep,
      for she kept them. '
    10: '¹⁰ When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and
      the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
      from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. '
    11: '¹¹ Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. '
    12: "¹² Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s\
      \ son. She ran and told her father. \n"
    13: '¹³ When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob,
      and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban
      all these things. '
    14: '¹⁴ Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed
      with him for a month. '
    15: "¹⁵ Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore\
      \ serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name
      of the younger was Rachel. '
    17: '¹⁷ Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. '
    18: "¹⁸ Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel,\
      \ your younger daughter.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give\
      \ her to another man. Stay with me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days,\
      \ for the love he had for her. \n"
    21: "²¹ Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that\
      \ I may go in to her.” \n"
    22: '²² Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. '
    23: '²³ In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He
      went in to her. '
    24: '²⁴ Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant. '
    25: "²⁵ In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you\
      \ have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived\
      \ me?” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before
      the firstborn. '
    27: "²⁷ Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for\
      \ the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter
      as wife. '
    29: '²⁹ Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant. '
    30: "³⁰ He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and\
      \ served with him seven more years. \n"
    31: '³¹ Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was
      barren. '
    32: '³² Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said,
      “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.” '
    33: '³³ She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard
      that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon. '
    34: '³⁴ She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband
      will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name
      was called Levi. '
    35: ³⁵ She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time I will praise
      Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
  30:
    1: "¹ When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister.\
      \ She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.” \n"
    2: "² Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place,\
      \ who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” \n"
    3: '³ She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my
      knees, and I also may obtain children by her.” '
    4: '⁴ She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her. '
    5: '⁵ Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. '
    6: '⁶ Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given
      me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. '
    7: '⁷ Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. '
    8: "⁸ Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and\
      \ have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali. \n"
    9: '⁹ When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant,
      and gave her to Jacob as a wife. '
    10: '¹⁰ Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son. '
    11: '¹¹ Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad. '
    12: '¹² Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son. '
    13: "¹³ Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named\
      \ him Asher. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field,\
      \ and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give\
      \ me some of your son’s mandrakes.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband?\
      \ Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”\nRachel said, “Therefore he\
      \ will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him,\
      \ and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s\
      \ mandrakes.”\nHe lay with her that night. "
    17: '¹⁷ God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. '
    18: '¹⁸ Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my
      husband.” She named him Issachar. '
    19: '¹⁹ Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. '
    20: '²⁰ Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will
      live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun. '
    21: "²¹ Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah. \n"
    22: '²² God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. '
    23: '²³ She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.” '
    24: "²⁴ She named him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that
      I may go to my own place, and to my country. '
    26: "²⁶ Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me\
      \ go; for you know my service with which I have served you.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here,
      for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.” '
    28: "²⁸ He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock
      have fared with me. '
    30: "³⁰ For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to\
      \ a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide\
      \ for my own house also?” \n"
    31: "³¹ Laban said, “What shall I give you?”\nJacob said, “You shall not give\
      \ me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock\
      \ and keep it. "
    32: '³² I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled
      and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled
      among the goats. This will be my hire. '
    33: "³³ So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning\
      \ my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among\
      \ the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered\
      \ stolen.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.” \n"
    35: '³⁵ That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and
      all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white
      in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of
      his sons. '
    36: "³⁶ He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the\
      \ rest of Laban’s flocks. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled
      white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. '
    38: '³⁸ He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering
      troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. '
    39: '³⁹ The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked,
      speckled, and spotted. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the
      streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and
      didn’t put them into Laban’s flock. '
    41: '⁴¹ Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front
      of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive among
      the rods; '
    42: '⁴² but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler
      were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. '
    43: ⁴³ The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and
      male servants, and camels and donkeys.
  31:
    1: '¹ Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that
      was our father’s. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.” '
    2: '² Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward
      him as before. '
    3: "³ Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives,\
      \ and I will be with you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, '
    5: '⁵ and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is
      not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. '
    6: '⁶ You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. '
    7: '⁷ Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t
      allow him to hurt me. '
    8: '⁸ If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled.
      If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked. '
    9: '⁹ Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me. '
    10: '¹⁰ During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold,
      the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. '
    11: '¹¹ The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I
      am.’ '
    12: '¹² He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which
      leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all
      that Laban does to you. '
    13: "¹³ I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a\
      \ vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your\
      \ birth.’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance
      for us in our father’s house? '
    15: '¹⁵ Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has
      also used up our money. '
    16: "¹⁶ For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and\
      \ our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, '
    18: '¹⁸ and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had
      gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go
      to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. '
    19: "¹⁹ Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim that\
      \ were her father’s. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was
      running away. '
    21: "²¹ So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and\
      \ set his face toward the mountain of Gilead. \n"
    22: '²² Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. '
    23: '²³ He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He
      overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. '
    24: "²⁴ God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him,\
      \ “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain,
      and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. '
    26: '²⁶ Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and
      carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? '
    27: '²⁷ Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I
      might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with
      harp; '
    28: '²⁸ and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done
      foolishly. '
    29: '²⁹ It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father
      spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either
      good or bad.’ '
    30: "³⁰ Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s\
      \ house, but why have you stolen my gods?” \n"
    31: '³¹ Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should
      take your daughters from me by force.’ '
    32: "³² Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern\
      \ what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had\
      \ stolen them. \n"
    33: '³³ Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the
      two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and
      entered into Rachel’s tent. '
    34: '³⁴ Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and
      sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them. '
    35: "³⁵ She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise\
      \ up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the\
      \ teraphim. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is
      my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? '
    37: "³⁷ Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of\
      \ all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives,\
      \ that they may judge between us two. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats
      have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks. '
    39: '³⁹ That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss.
      Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. '
    40: '⁴⁰ This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
      by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. '
    41: '⁴¹ These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years
      for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my
      wages ten times. '
    42: "⁴² Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,\
      \ had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen\
      \ my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.” \n"
    43: '⁴³ Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are
      my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can
      I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? '
    44: "⁴⁴ Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between\
      \ me and you.” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made
      a heap. They ate there by the heap. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore
      it was named Galeed '
    49: '⁴⁹ and Mizpah, for he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are
      absent one from another. '
    50: '⁵⁰ If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters,
      no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.” '
    51: '⁵¹ Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have
      set between me and you. '
    52: '⁵² May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not
      pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this
      pillar to me, for harm. '
    53: '⁵³ The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge
      between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to
      eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. '
    55: ⁵⁵ Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters,
      and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.
  32:
    1: '¹ Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. '
    2: "² When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of\
      \ that place Mahanaim. \n"
    3: '³ Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land
      of Seir, the field of Edom. '
    4: '⁴ He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This
      is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and
      stayed until now. '
    5: '⁵ I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have
      sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’” '
    6: '⁶ The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau.
      He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” '
    7: '⁷ Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people
      who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two
      companies. '
    8: '⁸ He said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company
      which is left will escape.” '
    9: '⁹ Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh,
      who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do
      you good,’ '
    10: '¹⁰ I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all
      the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed
      over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. '
    11: '¹¹ Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau;
      for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children. '
    12: "¹² You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand\
      \ of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’” \n"
    13: '¹³ He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a
      present for Esau, his brother: '
    14: '¹⁴ two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty
      rams, '
    15: '¹⁵ thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female
      donkeys and ten foals. '
    16: '¹⁶ He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself,
      and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd
      and herd.” '
    17: '¹⁷ He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you,
      and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before
      you?’ '
    18: '¹⁸ Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent
      to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’” '
    19: '¹⁹ He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the
      herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind\
      \ us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before\
      \ me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.” \n"
    21: "²¹ So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night\
      \ in the camp. \n"
    22: '²² He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and
      his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. '
    23: '²³ He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which
      he had. '
    24: '²⁴ Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking
      of the day. '
    25: '²⁵ When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow
      of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled. '
    26: "²⁶ The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.”\nJacob said, “I won’t let\
      \ you go unless you bless me.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ He said to him, “What is your name?”\nHe said, “Jacob”. \n"
    28: "²⁸ He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you\
      \ have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”\nHe said, “Why is it that\
      \ you ask what my name is?” So he blessed him there. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for he said, “I have seen God
      face to face, and my life is preserved.” '
    31: '³¹ The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of
      his thigh. '
    32: ³² Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which
      is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of
      Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
  33:
    1: '¹ Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and
      with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and
      the two servants. '
    2: '² He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after,
      and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. '
    3: "³ He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground\
      \ seven times, until he came near to his brother. \n"
    4: '⁴ Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they
      wept. '
    5: "⁵ He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who\
      \ are these with you?”\nHe said, “The children whom God has graciously given\
      \ your servant.” "
    6: '⁶ Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. '
    7: "⁷ Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them,\
      \ Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves. \n"
    8: "⁸ Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”\nJacob said,\
      \ “To find favor in the sight of my lord.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then
      receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the
      face of God, and you were pleased with me. '
    11: "¹¹ Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously\
      \ with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it. \n"
    12: "¹² Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before\
      \ you.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that
      the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one
      day, all the flocks will die. '
    14: "¹⁴ Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently,\
      \ according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to\
      \ the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with\
      \ me.”\nHe said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. '
    17: "¹⁷ Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for\
      \ his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan,
      when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. '
    19: '¹⁹ He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand
      of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. '
    20: ²⁰ He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.
  34:
    1: '¹ Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the
      daughters of the land. '
    2: '² Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He
      took her, lay with her, and humbled her. '
    3: '³ His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young
      lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. '
    4: "⁴ Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a\
      \ wife.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were
      with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. '
    6: '⁶ Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were
      grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying
      with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done. '
    8: '⁸ Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for
      your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. '
    9: '⁹ Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters
      for yourselves. '
    10: "¹⁰ You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade\
      \ in it, and get possessions in it.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in
      your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. '
    12: "¹² Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of\
      \ me, but give me the young lady as a wife.” \n"
    13: '¹³ The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when
      they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, '
    14: '¹⁴ and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who
      is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. '
    15: '¹⁵ Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are,
      that every male of you be circumcised, '
    16: '¹⁶ then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters
      to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. '
    17: "¹⁷ But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take\
      \ our sister, and we will be gone.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. '
    19: '¹⁹ The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in
      Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father. '
    20: '²⁰ Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked
      with the men of their city, saying, '
    21: '²¹ “These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and
      trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their
      daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters. '
    22: '²² Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to
      become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. '
    23: "²³ Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours?\
      \ Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem
      his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his
      city. '
    25: '²⁵ On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and
      Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city,
      and killed all the males. '
    26: '²⁶ They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and
      took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. '
    27: '²⁷ Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had
      defiled their sister. '
    28: '²⁸ They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in
      the city, that which was in the field, '
    29: '²⁹ and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their
      wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. '
    30: "³⁰ Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious\
      \ to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I\
      \ am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike\
      \ me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.” \n"
    31: ³¹ They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”
  35:
    1: "¹ God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an\
      \ altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your\
      \ brother.” \n"
    2: '² Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away
      the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments. '
    3: "³ Let’s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who\
      \ answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I\
      \ went.” \n"
    4: '⁴ They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the
      rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by
      Shechem. '
    5: '⁵ They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them,
      and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob. '
    6: '⁶ So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan,
      he and all the people who were with him. '
    7: '⁷ He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there
      God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. '
    8: "⁸ Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the\
      \ oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth. \n"
    9: '⁹ God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed
      him. '
    10: '¹⁰ God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any
      more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel. '
    11: '¹¹ God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation
      and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body. '
    12: "¹² The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and\
      \ to your offspring after you I will give the land.” \n"
    13: '¹³ God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of
      stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. '
    15: "¹⁵ Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Bethel”.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath,
      and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor. '
    17: "¹⁷ When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid,\
      \ for now you will have another son.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his
      father named him Benjamin. '
    19: '¹⁹ Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem). '
    20: '²⁰ Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s
      grave to this day. '
    21: '²¹ Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. '
    22: "²² While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his\
      \ father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.\nNow the sons of Jacob were twelve. "
    23: '²³ The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar,
      and Zebulun. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. '
    25: '²⁵ The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s servant): Dan and Naphtali. '
    26: '²⁶ The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons
      of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. '
    27: "²⁷ Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron),\
      \ where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners. \n"
    28: '²⁸ The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years. '
    29: ²⁹ Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people, old
      and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.
  36:
    1: '¹ Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). '
    2: '² Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon,
      the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the
      Hivite; '
    3: '³ and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. '
    4: '⁴ Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. '
    5: '⁵ Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who
      were born to him in the land of Canaan. '
    6: '⁶ Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his
      household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which
      he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother
      Jacob. '
    7: '⁷ For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land
      of their travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock. '
    8: "⁸ Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom. \n"
    9: '⁹ This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
      in the hill country of Seir: '
    10: '¹⁰ these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife
      of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. '
    11: '¹¹ The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. '
    12: '¹² Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek.
      These are the descendants of Adah, Esau’s wife. '
    13: '¹³ These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These
      were the descendants of Basemath, Esau’s wife. '
    14: "¹⁴ These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter\
      \ of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn
      of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, '
    16: '¹⁶ chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs who came
      of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. '
    17: '¹⁷ These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief
      Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of

    18: '¹⁸ These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam,

    19: "¹⁹ These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan,
      Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, '
    21: '²¹ Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites,
      the children of Seir in the land of Edom. '
    22: '²² The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna. '
    23: '²³ These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. '
    24: '²⁴ These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found
      the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. '
    25: '²⁵ These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of
      Anah. '
    26: '²⁶ These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. '

      \ of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. \n"
    31: '³¹ These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned
      over the children of Israel. '
    32: '³² Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah. '
    33: '³³ Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place. '
    34: '³⁴ Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. '
    35: '³⁵ Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field
      of Moab, reigned in his place. The name of his city was Avith. '
    36: '³⁶ Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place. '
    37: '³⁷ Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place. '
    38: '³⁸ Shaul died, and Baal Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place. '
    39: "³⁹ Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The\
      \ name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred,\

    40: '⁴⁰ These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their

      of the Edomites.
  37:
    1: '¹ Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. '
    2: '² This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
      years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons
      of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them
      to their father. '
    3: '³ Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son
      of his old age, and he made him a tunic of many colors. '
    4: "⁴ His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers,\
      \ and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him. \n"
    5: '⁵ Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him
      all the more. '
    6: '⁶ He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: '
    7: "⁷ for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose\
      \ and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down\
      \ to my sheaf.” \n"
    8: '⁸ His brothers asked him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed
      have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his
      words. '
    9: '⁹ He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold,
      I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven
      stars bowed down to me.” '
    10: '¹⁰ He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him,
      and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your
      mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to the earth before
      you?” '
    11: "¹¹ His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind. \n"
    12: '¹² His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. '
    13: "¹³ Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem?\
      \ Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and
      well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley
      of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. '
    15: "¹⁵ A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The\
      \ man asked him, “What are you looking for?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are\
      \ feeding the flock.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to\
      \ Dothan.’”\nJoseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. "
    18: '¹⁸ They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired
      against him to kill him. '
    19: '¹⁹ They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. '
    20: "²⁰ Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits,\
      \ and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will\
      \ become of his dreams.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s
      not take his life.” '
    22: '²² Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in
      the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their
      hand, to restore him to his father. '
    23: '²³ When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the
      tunic of many colors that was on him; '
    24: "²⁴ and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There\
      \ was no water in it. \n"
    25: '²⁵ They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked,
      and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing
      spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother
      and conceal his blood? '
    27: '²⁷ Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on
      him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him. '
    28: "²⁸ Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph\
      \ out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.\
      \ The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and
      he tore his clothes. '
    30: '³⁰ He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where
      will I go?” '
    31: '³¹ They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic
      in the blood. '
    32: "³² They took the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father,\
      \ and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s\
      \ tunic or not.” \n"
    33: '³³ He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has
      devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.” '
    34: '³⁴ Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for
      his son many days. '
    35: '³⁵ All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused
      to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.”
      His father wept for him. '
    36: ³⁶ The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s,
      the captain of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite,
      whose name was Hirah. '
    2: '² There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He
      took her, and went in to her. '
    3: '³ She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. '
    4: '⁴ She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan. '
    5: '⁵ She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she
      bore him. '
    6: '⁶ Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. '
    7: '⁷ Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in Yahweh’s sight. So Yahweh killed him. '
    8: '⁸ Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty
      of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” '
    9: '⁹ Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his
      brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring
      to his brother. '
    10: '¹⁰ The thing which he did was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and he killed him also. '
    11: "¹¹ Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your\
      \ father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he\
      \ also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted,
      and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. '
    13: '¹³ Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear
      his sheep.” '
    14: '¹⁴ She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her
      veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way
      to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him
      as a wife. '
    15: '¹⁵ When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had
      covered her face. '
    16: "¹⁶ He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to\
      \ you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.\nShe said, “What\
      \ will you give me, that you may come in to me?” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.”\nShe said, “Will\
      \ you give me a pledge, until you send it?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He said, “What pledge will I give you?”\nShe said, “Your signet and your\
      \ cord, and your staff that is in your hand.”\nHe gave them to her, and came\
      \ in to her, and she conceived by him. "
    19: '¹⁹ She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the
      garments of her widowhood. '
    20: '²⁰ Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to
      receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. '
    21: "²¹ Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute,\
      \ that was at Enaim by the road?”\nThey said, “There has been no prostitute\
      \ here.” \n"
    22: '²² He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men
      of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’” '
    23: "²³ Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young\
      \ goat, and you haven’t found her.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law,\
      \ has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.”\n\
      Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.” "
    25: "²⁵ When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am\
      \ with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose\
      \ these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because\
      \ I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.”\nHe knew her again no more. "
    27: '²⁷ In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb. '
    28: '²⁸ When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied
      a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.” '
    29: '²⁹ As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said,
      “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez. '
    30: ³⁰ Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand,
      and his name was called Zerah.
  39:
    1: '¹ Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the
      captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites
      that had brought him down there. '
    2: '² Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house
      of his master the Egyptian. '
    3: '³ His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he
      did prosper in his hand. '
    4: '⁴ Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made
      him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. '
    5: '⁵ From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that
      he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing
      was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. '
    6: "⁶ He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with\
      \ anything, except for the food which he ate.\nJoseph was well-built and handsome. "
    7: "⁷ After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said,\
      \ “Lie with me.” \n"
    8: '⁸ But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t
      know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. '
    9: "⁹ No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything\
      \ from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness,\
      \ and sin against God?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by
      her, or to be with her. '
    11: '¹¹ About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were
      none of the men of the house inside. '
    12: "¹² She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!”\nHe left his garment\
      \ in her hand, and ran outside. "
    13: '¹³ When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, '
    14: '¹⁴ she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold,
      he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me,
      and I cried with a loud voice. '
    15: '¹⁵ When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment
      by me, and ran outside.” '
    16: '¹⁶ She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. '
    17: '¹⁷ She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant,
      whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, '
    18: "¹⁸ and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and\
      \ ran outside.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying,
      “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled. '
    20: '²⁰ Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where
      the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. '
    21: '²¹ But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor
      in the sight of the keeper of the prison. '
    22: '²² The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners
      who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. '
    23: ²³ The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his
      hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.
  40:
    1: '¹ After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended
      their lord, the king of Egypt. '
    2: '² Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief
      baker. '
    3: '³ He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the
      prison, the place where Joseph was bound. '
    4: '⁴ The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them.
      They stayed in prison many days. '
    5: '⁵ They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according
      to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king
      of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. '
    6: '⁶ Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were
      sad. '
    7: "⁷ He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s\
      \ house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?” \n"
    8: "⁸ They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can\
      \ interpret it.”\nJoseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God?\
      \ Please tell it to me.” \n"
    9: '⁹ The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream,
      behold, a vine was in front of me, '
    10: '¹⁰ and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed,
      and its clusters produced ripe grapes. '
    11: "¹¹ Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them\
      \ into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” \n"
    12: '¹² Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are
      three days. '
    13: '¹³ Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you
      to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when
      you were his cup bearer. '
    14: '¹⁴ But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me,
      and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. '
    15: "¹⁵ For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here\
      \ also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to
      Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were
      on my head. '
    17: "¹⁷ In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh,\
      \ and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three
      days. '
    19: '¹⁹ Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and
      will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” '
    20: '²⁰ On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all
      his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head
      of the chief baker among his servants. '
    21: '²¹ He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the
      cup into Pharaoh’s hand; '
    22: '²² but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. '
    23: ²³ Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.
  41:
    1: '¹ At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the
      river. '
    2: '² Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat,
      and they fed in the marsh grass. '
    3: '³ Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and
      thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. '
    4: '⁴ The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh
      awoke. '
    5: '⁵ He slept and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came
      up on one stalk, healthy and good. '
    6: '⁶ Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung
      up after them. '
    7: '⁷ The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh
      awoke, and behold, it was a dream. '
    8: "⁸ In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all\
      \ of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there\
      \ was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults
      today. '
    10: '¹⁰ Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house
      of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker. '
    11: '¹¹ We dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamed according
      to the interpretation of his dream. '
    12: '¹² There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain
      of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted
      to each man according to his dream. '
    13: "¹³ As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he\
      \ hanged him.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
      of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. '
    15: "¹⁵ Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who\
      \ can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream\
      \ you can interpret it.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh\
      \ an answer of peace.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of
      the river; '
    18: '¹⁸ and behold, seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river. They
      fed in the marsh grass; '
    19: '¹⁹ and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly
      and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. '
    20: '²⁰ The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle; '
    21: '²¹ and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten
      them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. '
    22: '²² I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk,
      full and good; '
    23: '²³ and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the
      east wind, sprung up after them. '
    24: "²⁴ The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I\
      \ told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about
      to do he has declared to Pharaoh. '
    26: '²⁶ The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain
      are seven years. The dream is one. '
    27: '²⁷ The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years,
      and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will
      be seven years of famine. '
    28: '²⁸ That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh
      what he is about to do. '
    29: '²⁹ Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are
      coming. '
    30: '³⁰ Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be
      forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, '
    31: '³¹ and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine
      which follows; for it will be very grievous. '
    32: "³² The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by\
      \ God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. \n"
    33: '³³ “Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him
      over the land of Egypt. '
    34: '³⁴ Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and
      take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous
      years. '
    35: '³⁵ Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store
      grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. '
    36: "³⁶ The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine,\
      \ which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through\
      \ the famine.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his
      servants. '
    38: '³⁸ Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in
      whom is the Spirit of God?” '
    39: '³⁹ Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there
      is no one so discreet and wise as you. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your
      word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” '
    41: '⁴¹ Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” '
    42: '⁴² Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s
      hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his
      neck. '
    43: '⁴³ He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before
      him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift
      up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” '
    45: "⁴⁵ Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the\
      \ daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land\
      \ of Egypt. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.
      Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land
      of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. '
    48: '⁴⁸ He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land
      of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from
      the fields around that city. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped
      counting, for it was without number. '
    50: '⁵⁰ To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath,
      the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. '
    51: '⁵¹ Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, he said, “God
      has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” '
    52: "⁵² The name of the second, he called Ephraim: “For God has made me fruitful\
      \ in the land of my affliction.” \n"
    53: '⁵³ The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an
      end. '
    54: '⁵⁴ The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There
      was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. '
    55: '⁵⁵ When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for
      bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to
      you, do.” '
    56: '⁵⁶ The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the
      store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of
      Egypt. '
    57: ⁵⁷ All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine
      was severe in all the earth.
  42:
    1: '¹ Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons,
      “Why do you look at one another?” '
    2: '² He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there,
      and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” '
    3: '³ Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. '
    4: '⁴ But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for
      he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.” '
    5: '⁵ The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was
      in the land of Canaan. '
    6: '⁶ Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people
      of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their
      faces to the earth. '
    7: "⁷ Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger\
      \ to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come\
      \ from?”\nThey said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him. '
    9: "⁹ Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them,\
      \ “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. '
    11: "¹¹ We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man\
      \ in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father,\
      \ and one is no more.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ '
    15: '¹⁵ By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go
      out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. '
    16: '¹⁶ Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound,
      that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the
      life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” '
    17: "¹⁷ He put them all together into custody for three days. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. '
    19: '¹⁹ If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your
      prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. '
    20: "²⁰ Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and\
      \ you won’t die.”\nThey did so. "
    21: '²¹ They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother,
      in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t
      listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.” '
    22: '²² Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against
      the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.” '
    23: '²³ They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter
      between them. '
    24: '²⁴ He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them,
      and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their
      eyes. '
    25: "²⁵ Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore\
      \ each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was\
      \ done to them. \n"
    26: '²⁶ They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. '
    27: '²⁷ As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging
      place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. '
    28: '²⁸ He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!”
      Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying,
      “What is this that God has done to us?” '
    29: '²⁹ They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all
      that had happened to them, saying, '
    30: '³⁰ “The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for
      spies of the country. '
    31: '³¹ We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies. '
    32: '³² We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest
      is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’ '
    33: '³³ The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you
      are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine
      of your houses, and go your way. '
    34: "³⁴ Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies,\
      \ but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you\
      \ shall trade in the land.’” \n"
    35: '³⁵ As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in
      his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. '
    36: "³⁶ Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children!\
      \ Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away.\
      \ All these things are against me.” \n"
    37: "³⁷ Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring\
      \ him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.” \n"
    38: ³⁸ He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and
      he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then
      you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”
  43:
    1: '¹ The famine was severe in the land. '
    2: "² When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their\
      \ father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.” \n"
    3: '³ Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall
      not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ '
    4: '⁴ If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food; '
    5: "⁵ but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You\
      \ shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” \n"
    6: "⁶ Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had\
      \ another brother?” \n"
    7: "⁷ They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning\
      \ our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’\
      \ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would\
      \ say, ‘Bring your brother down?’” \n"
    8: '⁸ Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up
      and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little
      ones. '
    9: '⁹ I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t
      bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever; '
    10: "¹⁰ for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time\
      \ by now.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take
      from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for
      the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; '
    12: '¹² and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned
      in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. '
    13: '¹³ Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. '
    14: "¹⁴ May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to\
      \ you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am\
      \ bereaved.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and
      Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. '
    16: "¹⁶ When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house,\
      \ “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the\
      \ men will dine with me at noon.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s
      house. '
    18: '¹⁸ The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and
      they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time,
      we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize
      us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” '
    19: '¹⁹ They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him
      at the door of the house, '
    20: '²⁰ and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. '
    21: '²¹ When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each
      man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have
      brought it back in our hand. '
    22: "²² We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know\
      \ who put our money in our sacks.” \n"
    23: '²³ He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your
      father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought
      Simeon out to them. '
    24: '²⁴ The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and
      they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. '
    25: "²⁵ They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard\
      \ that they should eat bread there. \n"
    26: '²⁶ When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their
      hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him. '
    27: "²⁷ He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old\
      \ man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They
      bowed down humbly. '
    29: '²⁹ He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son,
      and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said,
      “God be gracious to you, my son.” '
    30: '³⁰ Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought
      a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there. '
    31: "³¹ He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve\
      \ the meal.” \n"
    32: '³² They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians
      who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews,
      for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. '
    33: '³³ They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the
      youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another. '
    34: ³⁴ He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five
      times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
  44:
    1: '¹ He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with
      food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth. '
    2: '² Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his
      grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. '
    3: '³ As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their
      donkeys. '
    4: '⁴ When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said
      to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them,
      ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good? '
    5: '⁵ Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines?
      You have done evil in so doing.’” '
    6: "⁶ He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them. \n"
    7: '⁷ They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it
      from your servants that they should do such a thing! '
    8: '⁸ Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again
      to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out
      of your lord’s house? '
    9: "⁹ With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will\
      \ be my lord’s slaves.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He said, “Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it\
      \ is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and
      each man opened his sack. '
    12: '¹² He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The
      cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. '
    13: "¹³ Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned\
      \ to the city. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there.
      They fell on the ground before him. '
    15: "¹⁵ Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you\
      \ know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we\
      \ clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold,\
      \ we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand\
      \ the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your\
      \ father.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant
      speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant;
      for you are even as Pharaoh. '
    19: '¹⁹ My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ '
    20: '²⁰ We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his
      old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his
      mother; and his father loves him.’ '
    21: '²¹ You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes
      on him.’ '
    22: '²² We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father, for if he should
      leave his father, his father would die.’ '
    23: '²³ You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with
      you, you will see my face no more.’ '
    24: '²⁴ When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my
      lord. '
    25: '²⁵ Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’ '
    26: '²⁶ We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we
      will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother
      is with us.’ '
    27: '²⁷ Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two
      sons. '
    28: '²⁸ One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I
      haven’t seen him since. '
    29: '²⁹ If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring
      down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’ '
    30: '³⁰ Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not
      with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life; '
    31: '³¹ it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die.
      Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with
      sorrow to Sheol. '
    32: '³² For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If
      I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’ '
    33: '³³ Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s
      slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers. '
    34: ³⁴ For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see
      the evil that will come on my father.”
  45:
    1: '¹ Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him,
      and he called out, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with
      him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. '
    2: '² He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. '
    3: "³ Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?”\n\
      His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence. "
    4: "⁴ Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.”\nThey came near.\
      \ He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. "
    5: '⁵ Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here,
      for God sent me before you to preserve life. '
    6: '⁶ For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five
      years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest. '
    7: '⁷ God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to
      save you alive by a great deliverance. '
    8: '⁸ So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father
      to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph
      says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you,
      your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that
      you have. '
    11: '¹¹ There I will provide for you; for there are yet five years of famine;
      lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’ '
    12: '¹² Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is
      my mouth that speaks to you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you
      have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.” '
    14: '¹⁴ He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on
      his neck. '
    15: "¹⁵ He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers\
      \ talked with him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers
      have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. '
    17: '¹⁷ Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals,
      and go, travel to the land of Canaan. '
    18: '¹⁸ Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give
      you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ '
    19: '¹⁹ Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt
      for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. '
    20: "²⁰ Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of\
      \ all the land of Egypt is yours.” \n"
    21: '²¹ The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment
      of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. '
    22: '²² He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave
      three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. '
    23: '²³ He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good
      things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision
      for his father by the way. '
    24: "²⁴ So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See\
      \ that you don’t quarrel on the way.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob
      their father. '
    26: '²⁶ They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all
      the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them. '
    27: '²⁷ They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When
      he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their
      father, revived. '
    28: ²⁸ Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and
      see him before I die.”
  46:
    1: '¹ Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered
      sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. '
    2: "² God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!”\n\
      He said, “Here I am.” \n"
    3: '³ He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into
      Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. '
    4: "⁴ I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again.\
      \ Joseph’s hand will close your eyes.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their
      father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had
      sent to carry him. '
    6: '⁶ They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the
      land of Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his offspring with him, '
    7: "⁷ his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters,\
      \ and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt. \n"
    8: '⁸ These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob
      and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. '
    10: '¹⁰ The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the
      son of a Canaanite woman. '
    11: '¹¹ The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. '
    12: '¹² The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan
      died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. '
    14: '¹⁴ The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. '
    15: '¹⁵ These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with
      his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. '
    16: '¹⁶ The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. '
    17: '¹⁷ The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister.
      The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. '
    18: '¹⁸ These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and
      these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. '
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. '
    20: '²⁰ To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath,
      the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. '
    21: '²¹ The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim,
      Huppim, and Ard. '
    22: '²² These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were
      fourteen. '
    23: '²³ The son of Dan: Hushim. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. '
    25: '²⁵ These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter,
      and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven. '
    26: '²⁶ All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring,
      in addition to Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six. '
    27: "²⁷ The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All\
      \ the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen,
      and they came into the land of Goshen. '
    29: '²⁹ Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in
      Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck
      a good while. '
    30: "³⁰ Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that\
      \ you are still alive.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up,
      and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house,
      who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. '
    32: '³² These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and
      they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’ '
    33: '³³ It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your
      occupation?’ '
    34: ³⁴ that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from
      our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the
      land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”
  47:
    1: '¹ Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers,
      with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the
      land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” '
    2: '² From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. '
    3: "³ Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”\nThey said to Pharaoh,\
      \ “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.” "
    4: "⁴ They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land,\
      \ for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe\
      \ in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the\
      \ land of Goshen.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come
      to you. '
    6: "⁶ The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell\
      \ in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know\
      \ any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob
      blessed Pharaoh. '
    8: "⁸ Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?” \n"
    9: '⁹ Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty
      years. The days of the years of my life have been few and evil. They have not
      attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their
      pilgrimage.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession
      in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh
      had commanded. '
    12: "¹² Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household\
      \ with bread, according to the sizes of their families. \n"
    13: '¹³ There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so
      that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. '
    14: '¹⁴ Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt,
      and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought
      the money into Pharaoh’s house. '
    15: "¹⁵ When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\
      \ Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why\
      \ should we die in your presence? For our money fails.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your\
      \ livestock, if your money is gone.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in
      exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the
      donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for
      that year. '
    18: '¹⁸ When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to
      him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds
      of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but
      our bodies, and our lands. '
    19: "¹⁹ Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our\
      \ land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed,\
      \ that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the
      Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land
      became Pharaoh’s. '
    21: '²¹ As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border
      of Egypt even to the other end of it. '
    22: '²² Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion
      from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they
      didn’t sell their land. '
    23: '²³ Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land
      today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. '
    24: "²⁴ It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh,\
      \ and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for\
      \ them of your households, and for food for your little ones.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of\
      \ my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that\
      \ Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become\
      \ Pharaoh’s. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got
      themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. '
    28: '²⁸ Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob,
      the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years. '
    29: '²⁹ The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph,
      and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand
      under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt, '
    30: "³⁰ but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and\
      \ bury me in their burying place.”\nJoseph said, “I will do as you have said.”\
      \ \n"
    31: ³¹ Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself
      on the bed’s head.
  48:
    1: '¹ After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.”
      He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. '
    2: '² Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and
      Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. '
    3: '³ Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of
      Canaan, and blessed me, '
    4: '⁴ and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and
      I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring
      after you for an everlasting possession.’ '
    5: '⁵ Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came
      to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon,
      will be mine. '
    6: '⁶ Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours.
      They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. '
    7: "⁷ As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of\
      \ Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath,\
      \ and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).” \n"
    8: "⁸ Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?” \n"
    9: "⁹ Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”\n\
      He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” "
    10: '¹⁰ Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well.
      Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. '
    11: '¹¹ Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold,
      God has let me see your offspring also.” '
    12: '¹² Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with
      his face to the earth. '
    13: '¹³ Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left
      hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought
      them near to him. '
    14: '¹⁴ Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who
      was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly,
      for Manasseh was the firstborn. '
    15: "¹⁵ He blessed Joseph, and said,\n“The God before whom my fathers Abraham\
      \ and Isaac walked,\nthe God who has fed me all my life long to this day,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,\nand let\
      \ my name be named on them,\nand the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.\n\
      Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim,
      it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s
      head to Manasseh’s head. '
    18: "¹⁸ Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn.\
      \ Put your right hand on his head.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become
      a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater
      than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.” '
    20: '²⁰ He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God
      make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. '
    21: '²¹ Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you,
      and bring you again to the land of your fathers. '
    22: ²² Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took
      out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”
  49:
    1: "¹ Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I\
      \ may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come. \n"
    2: "² Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.\n    Listen to Israel,\
      \ your father. \n"
    3: "³ “Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength,\n\
      \    excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.\n"
    4: "⁴ Boiling over like water, you shall not excel,\n    because you went up to\
      \ your father’s bed,\n    then defiled it. He went up to my couch. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Simeon and Levi are brothers.\n    Their swords are weapons of violence.\n"
    6: "⁶ My soul, don’t come into their council.\n    My glory, don’t be united to\
      \ their assembly;\nfor in their anger they killed men.\n    In their self-will\
      \ they hamstrung cattle.\n"
    7: "⁷ Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;\n    and their wrath, for it was\
      \ cruel.\nI will divide them in Jacob,\n    and scatter them in Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Judah, your brothers will praise you.\n    Your hand will be on the neck\
      \ of your enemies.\n    Your father’s sons will bow down before you.\n"
    9: "⁹ Judah is a lion’s cub.\n    From the prey, my son, you have gone up.\nHe\
      \ stooped down, he crouched as a lion,\n    as a lioness.\n    Who will rouse\
      \ him up?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The scepter will not depart from Judah,\n    nor the ruler’s staff from\
      \ between his feet,\nuntil he comes to whom it belongs.\n    The obedience of\
      \ the peoples will be to him.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Binding his foal to the vine,\n    his donkey’s colt to the choice vine,\n\
      he has washed his garments in wine,\n    his robes in the blood of grapes.\n"
    12: "¹² His eyes will be red with wine,\n    his teeth white with milk. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.\n    He will be for a haven\
      \ of ships.\n    His border will be on Sidon. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Issachar is a strong donkey,\n    lying down between the saddlebags.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He saw a resting place, that it was good,\n    the land, that it was pleasant.\n\
      He bows his shoulder to the burden,\n    and becomes a servant doing forced\
      \ labor. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Dan will judge his people,\n    as one of the tribes of Israel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Dan will be a serpent on the trail,\n    an adder in the path,\nthat bites\
      \ the horse’s heels,\n    so that his rider falls backward.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have waited for your salvation, Yahweh. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “A troop will press on Gad,\n    but he will press on their heel. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Asher’s food will be rich.\n    He will produce royal dainties. \n"
    21: "²¹ “Naphtali is a doe set free,\n    who bears beautiful fawns. \n"
    22: "²² “Joseph is a fruitful vine,\n    a fruitful vine by a spring.\n    His\
      \ branches run over the wall.\n"
    23: "²³ The archers have severely grieved him,\n    shot at him, and persecuted\
      \ him:\n"
    24: "²⁴ But his bow remained strong.\n    The arms of his hands were made strong,\n\
      \    by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,\n    (from there is the shepherd,\

    25: "²⁵ even by the God of your father, who will help you,\n    by the Almighty,\
      \ who will bless you,\nwith blessings of heaven above,\n    blessings of the\
      \ deep that lies below,\n    blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.\n"
    26: "²⁶ The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your\
      \ ancestors,\n    above the boundaries of the ancient hills.\nThey will be on\
      \ the head of Joseph,\n    on the crown of the head of him who is separated\
      \ from his brothers. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.\n    In the morning he will devour the prey.\n\
      \    At evening he will divide the plunder.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father
      spoke to them, and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his own blessing. '
    29: '²⁹ He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people.
      Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, '
    30: '³⁰ in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre,
      in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite
      as a burial place. '
    31: '³¹ There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac
      and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah: '
    32: '³² the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children
      of Heth.” '
    33: ³³ When Jacob finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the
      bed, breathed his last breath, and was gathered to his people.
  50:
    1: '¹ Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him. '
    2: '² Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and
      the physicians embalmed Israel. '
    3: "³ Forty days were used for him, for that is how many the days it takes to\
      \ embalm. The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days. \n"
    4: '⁴ When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s staff,
      saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of
      Pharaoh, saying, '
    5: "⁵ ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave\
      \ which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please\
      \ let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’” \n"
    6: "⁶ Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants
      of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, '
    8: '⁸ all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their
      little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. '
    9: '⁹ Both chariots and horsemen went up with him. It was a very great company. '
    10: '¹⁰ They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan,
      and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned
      for his father seven days. '
    11: '¹¹ When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in
      the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.”
      Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. '
    12: '¹² His sons did to him just as he commanded them, '
    13: '¹³ for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the
      cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession
      for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre. '
    14: "¹⁴ Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up\
      \ with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It
      may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil
      which we did to him.” '
    16: '¹⁶ They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he
      died, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers,
      and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the disobedience
      of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. '
    18: '¹⁸ His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold,
      we are your servants.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God? '
    20: '²⁰ As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save
      many people alive, as is happening today. '
    21: "²¹ Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little\
      \ ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them. \n"
    22: '²² Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred
      ten years. '
    23: '²³ Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also
      of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees. '
    24: '²⁴ Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you,
      and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to
      Isaac, and to Jacob.” '
    25: '²⁵ Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely
      visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” '
    26: ²⁶ So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him,
      and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
