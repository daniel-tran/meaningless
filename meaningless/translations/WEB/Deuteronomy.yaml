Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in
      the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth,
      and Dizahab. '
    2: '² It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh
      Barnea. '
    3: '³ In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month,
      Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh had given
      him in commandment to them, '
    4: '⁴ after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon,
      and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. '
    5: '⁵ Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law,
      saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough
      at this mountain. '
    7: '⁷ Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites
      and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the
      lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in
      Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. '
    8: "⁸ Behold, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which\
      \ Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to\
      \ them and to their offspring after them.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. '
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars
      of the sky for multitude. '
    11: '¹¹ Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as
      you are and bless you, as he has promised you! '
    12: '¹² How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? '
    13: "¹³ Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and\
      \ I will make them heads over you.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to
      do.” '
    15: '¹⁵ So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them
      heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties,
      captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. '
    16: '¹⁶ I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your
      brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner
      who is living with him. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and
      the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment
      is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will
      hear it.” '
    18: '¹⁸ I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. '
    19: '¹⁹ We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness
      which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our
      God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. '
    20: '²⁰ I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which
      Yahweh our God gives to us. '
    21: "²¹ Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession,\
      \ as Yahweh the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither\
      \ be dismayed.” \n"
    22: "²² You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before\
      \ us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the\
      \ way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” \n"
    23: '²³ The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every
      tribe. '
    24: '²⁴ They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley
      of Eshcol, and spied it out. '
    25: "²⁵ They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it\
      \ down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which\
      \ Yahweh our God gives to us.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh
      your God. '
    27: '²⁷ You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has
      brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites
      to destroy us. '
    28: "²⁸ Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying,\
      \ ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified\
      \ up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. '
    30: '³⁰ Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according
      to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, '
    31: "³¹ and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your God carried\
      \ you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came\
      \ to this place.” \n"
    32: '³² Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God, '
    33: '³³ who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your
      tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the
      cloud by day. '
    34: '³⁴ Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying, '
    35: '³⁵ “Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good
      land which I swore to give to your fathers, '
    36: "³⁶ except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land\
      \ that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed\
      \ Yahweh.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall
      not go in there. '
    38: '³⁸ Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage
      him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. '
    39: '³⁹ Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed,
      your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there.
      I will give it to them, and they shall possess it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the\
      \ way to the Red Sea.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will\
      \ go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every\
      \ man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill\
      \ country. \n"
    42: "⁴² Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am\
      \ not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’” \n"
    43: '⁴³ So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the
      commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. '
    44: '⁴⁴ The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and
      chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your
      voice, nor turn his ear to you. '
    46: ⁴⁶ So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
  2:
    1: "¹ Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the\
      \ Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. \n"
    2: '² Yahweh spoke to me, saying, '
    3: '³ “You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. '
    4: '⁴ Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your
      brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of
      you. Therefore be careful. '
    5: '⁵ Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no,
      not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount
      Seir to Esau for a possession. '
    6: "⁶ You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall\
      \ also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’” \n"
    7: "⁷ For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has\
      \ known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh\
      \ your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing. \n"
    8: "⁸ So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,\
      \ from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and\
      \ passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. \n"
    9: "⁹ Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle;\
      \ for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given\
      \ Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ (The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as
      the Anakim. '
    11: '¹¹ These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites
      call them Emim. '
    12: "¹² The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded\
      \ them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel\
      \ did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) \n"
    13: "¹³ “Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook\
      \ Zered. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the
      brook Zered were thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men of
      war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle
      of the camp, until they were consumed. '
    16: '¹⁶ So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, '
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh spoke to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. '
    19: "¹⁹ When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them,\
      \ nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children\
      \ of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot\
      \ for a possession.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ (That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the
      past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, '
    21: '²¹ a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them
      from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place; '
    22: '²² as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed
      the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place
      even to this day. '
    23: "²³ Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who\
      \ came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold,
      I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land;
      begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. '
    25: "²⁵ Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the\
      \ peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and\
      \ shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon
      with words of peace, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will
      turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for
      money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, '
    29: '²⁹ as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell
      in Ar, did to me; until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our
      God gives us.” '
    30: "³⁰ But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your\
      \ God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver\
      \ him into your hand, as it is today. \n"
    31: '³¹ Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land
      before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.” '
    32: '³² Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. '
    33: '³³ Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons,
      and all his people. '
    34: '³⁴ We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited
      city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining. '
    35: '³⁵ Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder
      of the cities which we had taken. '
    36: '³⁶ From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city
      that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us.
      Yahweh our God delivered up all before us. '
    37: '³⁷ Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the
      banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever
      Yahweh our God forbade us.'
  3:
    1: '¹ Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came
      out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. '
    2: "² Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his\
      \ people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon\
      \ king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” \n"
    3: '³ So Yahweh our God also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and
      all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining. '
    4: '⁴ We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t
      take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in
      Bashan. '
    5: '⁵ All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition
      to a great many villages without walls. '
    6: '⁶ We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying
      every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. '
    7: '⁷ But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder
      for ourselves. '
    8: '⁸ We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites
      who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. '
    9: '⁹ (The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) '
    10: '¹⁰ We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to
      Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. '
    11: '¹¹ (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold,
      his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon?
      Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a
      man.) '
    12: '¹² This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by
      the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities,
      I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites; '
    13: '¹³ and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the
      half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is
      called the land of Rephaim. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of
      the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his
      own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) '
    15: '¹⁵ I gave Gilead to Machir. '
    16: '¹⁶ To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley
      of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok,
      which is the border of the children of Ammon; '
    17: "¹⁷ the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to\
      \ the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this
      land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your
      brothers, the children of Israel. '
    19: '¹⁹ But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that
      you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, '
    20: "²⁰ until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess\
      \ the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall\
      \ each return to his own possession, which I have given you.” \n"
    21: '²¹ I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that
      Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms
      where you go over. '
    22: "²² You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ I begged Yahweh at that time, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and
      your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works
      like yours, and mighty acts like yours? '
    25: "²⁵ Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan,\
      \ that fine mountain, and Lebanon.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me.
      Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter. '
    27: '²⁷ Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward,
      and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over
      this Jordan. '
    28: '²⁸ But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall
      go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which
      you shall see.” '
    29: ²⁹ So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach
      you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh,
      the God of your fathers, gives you. '
    2: '² You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take
      away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I
      command you. '
    3: '³ Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your
      God has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you. '
    4: '⁴ But you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive today. '
    5: '⁵ Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God
      commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in
      to possess it. '
    6: '⁶ Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding
      in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely
      this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” '
    7: '⁷ For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them as Yahweh
      our God is whenever we call on him? '
    8: "⁸ What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous\
      \ as all this law which I set before you today? \n"
    9: '⁹ Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things
      which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your
      life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children— '
    10: '¹⁰ the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said
      to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that
      they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that
      they may teach their children.” '
    11: '¹¹ You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire
      to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. '
    12: '¹² Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice
      of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. '
    13: '¹³ He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even
      the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets. '
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances,
      that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. '
    15: '¹⁵ Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke
      to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire, '
    16: '¹⁶ lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form
      of any figure, the likeness of male or female, '
    17: '¹⁷ the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged
      bird that flies in the sky, '
    18: '¹⁸ the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any
      fish that is in the water under the earth; '
    19: '¹⁹ and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and
      the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and
      worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the
      peoples under the whole sky. '
    20: '²⁰ But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out
      of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today. '
    21: '²¹ Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I
      should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land
      which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance; '
    22: '²² but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall
      go over and possess that good land. '
    23: '²³ Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he
      made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which
      Yahweh your God has forbidden you. '
    24: '²⁴ For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. '
    25: '²⁵ When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long
      in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form
      of anything, and do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight to provoke
      him to anger, '
    26: '²⁶ I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon
      utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it.
      You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in
      number among the nations where Yahweh will lead you away. '
    28: '²⁸ There you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which
      neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. '
    29: '²⁹ But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you will find him when
      you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. '
    30: '³⁰ When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in
      the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God and listen to his voice. '
    31: '³¹ For Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you nor destroy
      you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them. '
    32: '³² For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the
      day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the
      other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been
      heard like it? '
    33: '³³ Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of
      the fire, as you have heard, and live? '
    34: '³⁴ Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another
      nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched
      arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you
      in Egypt before your eyes? '
    35: '³⁵ It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is
      no one else besides him. '
    36: '³⁶ Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you.
      On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the
      middle of the fire. '
    37: '³⁷ Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after
      them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; '
    38: '³⁸ to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to
      bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. '
    39: '³⁹ Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is God
      in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else. '
    40: "⁴⁰ You shall keep his statutes and his commandments which I command you today,\
      \ that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you\
      \ may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for all\
      \ time. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, '
    42: '⁴² that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally
      and didn’t hate him in time past, and that fleeing to one of these cities he
      might live: '
    43: "⁴³ Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and\
      \ Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.\
      \ \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. '
    45: '⁴⁵ These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances which
      Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt, '
    46: '⁴⁶ beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon
      king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel
      struck when they came out of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the
      two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; '
    48: '⁴⁸ from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount
      Sion (also called Hermon), '
    49: ⁴⁹ and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah,
      under the slopes of Pisgah.
  5:
    1: '¹ Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the statutes
      and the ordinances which I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them,
      and observe to do them.” '
    2: '² Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. '
    3: '³ Yahweh didn’t make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us,
      who are all of us here alive today. '
    4: '⁴ Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of
      the fire, '
    5: "⁵ (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you Yahweh’s word;\
      \ for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain)\
      \ saying, \n"
    6: "⁶ “I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of\
      \ the house of bondage. \n"
    7: "⁷ “You shall have no other gods before me. \n"
    8: '⁸ “You shall not make a carved image for yourself—any likeness of what is
      in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
      the earth. '
    9: '⁹ You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh your
      God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children
      and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me; '
    10: "¹⁰ and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep\
      \ my commandments. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your God; for Yahweh will not\
      \ hold him guiltless who misuses his name. \n"
    12: '¹² “Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded
      you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall labor six days, and do all your work; '
    14: '¹⁴ but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall
      not do any work— neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male
      servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your
      livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant
      and your female servant may rest as well as you. '
    15: "¹⁵ You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh\
      \ your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched\
      \ arm. Therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;\
      \ that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land which\
      \ Yahweh your God gives you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “You shall not murder. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “You shall not commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “You shall not steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. Neither shall you desire your\
      \ neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his\
      \ ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.” \n"
    22: '²² Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the
      middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice.
      He added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me. '
    23: '²³ When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the
      mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your
      tribes, and your elders; '
    24: '²⁴ and you said, “Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness,
      and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire. We have seen today
      that God does speak with man, and he lives. '
    25: '²⁵ Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us.
      If we hear Yahweh our God’s voice any more, then we shall die. '
    26: '²⁶ For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God
      speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived? '
    27: "²⁷ Go near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say, and tell us all that\
      \ Yahweh our God tells you; and we will hear it, and do it.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Yahweh heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me; and Yahweh
      said to me, “I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have
      spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken. '
    29: "²⁹ Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep\
      \ all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their\
      \ children forever! \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’ '
    31: "³¹ But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments,\
      \ and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they\
      \ may do them in the land which I give them to possess.” \n"
    32: '³² You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you.
      You shall not turn away to the right hand or to the left. '
    33: ³³ You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you,
      that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong
      your days in the land which you shall possess.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which
      Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land that
      you go over to possess; '
    2: '² that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments,
      which I command you—you, your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your
      life; and that your days may be prolonged. '
    3: "³ Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with you,\
      \ and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has\
      \ promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is one. '
    5: '⁵ You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul,
      and with all your might. '
    6: '⁶ These words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart; '
    7: '⁷ and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of
      them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you
      lie down, and when you rise up. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets
      between your eyes. '
    9: "⁹ You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which he swore
      to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and
      goodly cities which you didn’t build, '
    11: '¹¹ and houses full of all good things which you didn’t fill, and cisterns
      dug out which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees which you didn’t plant,
      and you shall eat and be full; '
    12: '¹² then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of
      Egypt, out of the house of bondage. '
    13: '¹³ You shall fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear
      by his name. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are
      around you, '
    15: '¹⁵ for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous God, lest the anger of Yahweh
      your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the
      earth. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and his
      testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall do that which is right and good in Yahweh’s sight, that it may
      be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh
      swore to your fathers, '
    19: "¹⁹ to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies,
      the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?” '
    21: '²¹ then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh
      brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; '
    22: '²² and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh,
      and on all his house, before our eyes; '
    23: '²³ and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us
      the land which he swore to our fathers. '
    24: '²⁴ Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God,
      for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are today. '
    25: ²⁵ It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all these commandments
      before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.”
  7:
    1: '¹ When Yahweh your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it,
      and casts out many nations before you—the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Amorite,
      the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—seven nations greater
      and mightier than you; '
    2: '² and when Yahweh your God delivers them up before you, and you strike them,
      then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, nor
      show mercy to them. '
    3: '³ You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter
      to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. '
    4: '⁴ For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve
      other gods. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy
      you quickly. '
    5: '⁵ But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars,
      dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved
      images with fire. '
    6: '⁶ For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. Yahweh your God has chosen
      you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the
      face of the earth. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh didn’t set his love on you nor choose you, because you were more
      in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples; '
    8: '⁸ but because Yahweh loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which
      he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and
      redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Know therefore that Yahweh your God himself is God, the faithful God, who
      keeps covenant and loving kindness to a thousand generations with those who
      love him and keep his commandments, '
    10: '¹⁰ and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will
      not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances
      which I command you today, to do them. '
    12: '¹² It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do
      them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness
      which he swore to your fathers. '
    13: '¹³ He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the
      fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine
      and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in
      the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren
      among you, or among your livestock. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and he will put none of the
      evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you, but will lay them on all those
      who hate you. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to
      you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their gods; for that
      would be a snare to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can
      I dispossess them?” '
    18: '¹⁸ you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your
      God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: '
    19: '¹⁹ the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty
      hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out. So
      shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. '
    20: '²⁰ Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those
      who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. '
    21: '²¹ You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is among you, a great
      and awesome God. '
    22: '²² Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you little by little.
      You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on
      you. '
    23: '²³ But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse
      them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed. '
    24: '²⁴ He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name
      perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you
      have destroyed them. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall
      not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself,
      lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God. '
    26: ²⁶ You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted
      thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for
      it is a devoted thing.
  8:
    1: '¹ You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today,
      that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh
      swore to your fathers. '
    2: '² You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty
      years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to test you, to know what
      was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. '
    3: '³ He humbled you, allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which
      you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know, that he might teach you that
      man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out
      of Yahweh’s mouth. '
    4: '⁴ Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these
      forty years. '
    5: '⁵ You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh
      your God disciplines you. '
    6: '⁶ You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways,
      and to fear him. '
    7: '⁷ For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water,
      of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills; '
    8: '⁸ a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive
      trees and honey; '
    9: '⁹ a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack
      anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may
      dig copper. '
    10: "¹⁰ You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the\
      \ good land which he has given you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments,
      his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you today; '
    12: '¹² lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses and
      lived in them; '
    13: '¹³ and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your
      gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; '
    14: '¹⁴ then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who
      brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; '
    15: '¹⁵ who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes
      and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water
      for you out of the rock of flint; '
    16: '¹⁶ who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know,
      that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your
      latter end; '
    17: '¹⁷ and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has
      gotten me this wealth.” '
    18: "¹⁸ But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power\
      \ to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers,\
      \ as it is today. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other
      gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you
      shall surely perish. '
    20: ²⁰ As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish,
      because you wouldn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice.
  9:
    1: '¹ Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess
      nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to
      the sky, '
    2: '² a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom
      you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” '
    3: "³ Know therefore today that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you\
      \ as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before\
      \ you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has\
      \ spoken to you. \n"
    4: '⁴ Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from
      before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;”
      because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these
      nations. '
    5: '⁵ Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go
      in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your
      God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word
      which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. '
    6: '⁶ Know therefore that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess
      for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people. '
    7: '⁷ Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in
      the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came
      to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. '
    8: '⁸ Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you
      to destroy you. '
    9: '⁹ When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even
      the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the
      mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. '
    10: "¹⁰ Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger.\
      \ On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out\
      \ of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly. \n"
    11: '¹¹ It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh
      gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant. '
    12: "¹² Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people\
      \ whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly\
      \ turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image\
      \ for themselves!” \n"
    13: '¹³ Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and
      behold, they are a stiff-necked people. '
    14: "¹⁴ Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from\
      \ under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning
      with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. '
    16: '¹⁶ I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had
      made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which
      Yahweh had commanded you. '
    17: '¹⁷ I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and
      broke them before your eyes. '
    18: '¹⁸ I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights.
      I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned,
      in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was
      angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also. '
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron
      also at the same time. '
    21: '²¹ I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire,
      and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw
      its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. '
    22: '²² At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to
      wrath. '
    23: '²³ When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the
      land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh
      your God, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice. '
    24: '²⁴ You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you. '
    25: '²⁵ So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell
      down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you. '
    26: '²⁶ I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people
      and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you
      have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    27: '²⁷ Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness
      of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin, '
    28: '²⁸ lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able
      to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated
      them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ '
    29: ²⁹ Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by
      your great power and by your outstretched arm.”
  10:
    1: '¹ At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and
      come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. '
    2: '² I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which
      you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” '
    3: '³ So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first,
      and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. '
    4: '⁴ He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments,
      which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the
      day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me. '
    5: "⁵ I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark\
      \ which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. \n"
    6: '⁶ (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There
      Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s
      office in his place. '
    7: '⁷ From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a
      land of brooks of water. '
    8: '⁸ At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s
      covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name,
      to this day. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh\
      \ is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.) \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights;
      and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they\
      \ shall go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to\
      \ them.” \n"
    12: '¹² Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh
      your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God
      with all your heart and with all your soul, '
    13: '¹³ to keep Yahweh’s commandments and statutes, which I command you today
      for your good? '
    14: '¹⁴ Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven, the heaven of heavens, and
      the earth, with all that is therein. '
    15: '¹⁵ Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their
      offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today. '
    16: '¹⁶ Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. '
    17: '¹⁷ For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God,
      the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes. '
    18: '¹⁸ He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner
      in giving him food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall fear Yahweh your God. You shall serve him. You shall cling to
      him, and you shall swear by his name. '
    21: '²¹ He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great
      and awesome things which your eyes have seen. '
    22: ²² Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh
      your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.
  11:
    1: '¹ Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his
      statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always. '
    2: '² Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and
      who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty
      hand, his outstretched arm, '
    3: '³ his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh
      the king of Egypt, and to all his land; '
    4: '⁴ and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots;
      how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and
      how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; '
    5: '⁵ and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; '
    6: '⁶ and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how
      the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their
      tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel; '
    7: "⁷ but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today,
      that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess; '
    9: '⁹ and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh swore to your
      fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and
      honey. '
    10: '¹⁰ For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt
      that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot,
      as a garden of herbs; '
    11: '¹¹ but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys
      which drinks water from the rain of the sky, '
    12: '¹² a land which Yahweh your God cares for. Yahweh your God’s eyes are always
      on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. '
    13: '¹³ It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which
      I command you today, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your
      heart and with all your soul, '
    14: '¹⁴ that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain
      and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your
      oil. '
    15: '¹⁵ I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat
      and be full. '
    16: '¹⁶ Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other
      gods and worship them; '
    17: '¹⁷ and Yahweh’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky so that
      there is no rain, and the land doesn’t yield its fruit; and you perish quickly
      from off the good land which Yahweh gives you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your
      soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets
      between your eyes. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in
      your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates; '
    21: '²¹ that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land
      which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens
      above the earth. '
    22: '²² For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command
      you—to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling
      to him— '
    23: '²³ then Yahweh will drive out all these nations from before you, and you
      shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. '
    24: '²⁴ Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from
      the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the
      western sea shall be your border. '
    25: '²⁵ No man will be able to stand before you. Yahweh your God will lay the
      fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has
      spoken to you. '
    26: '²⁶ Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: '
    27: '²⁷ the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which
      I command you today; '
    28: '²⁸ and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your
      God, but turn away out of the way which I command you today, to go after other
      gods which you have not known. '
    29: '²⁹ It shall happen, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land that you
      go to possess, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse
      on Mount Ebal. '
    30: '³⁰ Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the
      sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside
      the oaks of Moreh? '
    31: '³¹ For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which
      Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it. '
    32: ³² You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set
      before you today.
  12:
    1: '¹ These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do
      in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess
      all the days that you live on the earth. '
    2: '² You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall
      dispossess served their gods: on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under
      every green tree. '
    3: '³ You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn
      their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their
      gods. You shall destroy their name out of that place. '
    4: '⁴ You shall not do so to Yahweh your God. '
    5: '⁵ But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes,
      to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall come there. '
    6: '⁶ You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the
      wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn
      of your herd and of your flock there. '
    7: '⁷ There you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all
      that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your God
      has blessed you. '
    8: '⁸ You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever
      is right in his own eyes; '
    9: '⁹ for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Yahweh
      your God gives you. '
    10: '¹⁰ But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which Yahweh your
      God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around
      you, so that you dwell in safety, '
    11: '¹¹ then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose,
      to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you:
      your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your
      hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh. '
    12: '¹² You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God—you, and your sons, your daughters,
      your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite who is within your
      gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you. '
    13: '¹³ Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that
      you see; '
    14: "¹⁴ but in the place which Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes, there you\
      \ shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command\
      \ you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire
      of your soul, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you.
      The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer. '
    16: '¹⁶ Only you shall not eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth like
      water. '
    17: '¹⁷ You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your
      new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor
      any of your vows which you vow, nor your free will offerings, nor the wave offering
      of your hand; '
    18: '¹⁸ but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh
      your God shall choose: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your
      female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates. You shall rejoice before
      Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to. '
    19: "¹⁹ Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your\
      \ land. \n"
    20: '²⁰ When Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has promised you, and
      you say, “I want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat, you may
      eat meat, after all the desire of your soul. '
    21: '²¹ If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to put his name is too
      far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh
      has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after
      all the desire of your soul. '
    22: '²² Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it.
      The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. '
    23: '²³ Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life.
      You shall not eat the life with the meat. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall not eat it. You shall pour it out on the earth like water. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and with your children
      after you, when you do that which is right in Yahweh’s eyes. '
    26: '²⁶ Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and
      go to the place which Yahweh shall choose. '
    27: '²⁷ You shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on Yahweh
      your God’s altar. The blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on Yahweh
      your God’s altar, and you shall eat the meat. '
    28: "²⁸ Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well\
      \ with you and with your children after you forever, when you do that which\
      \ is good and right in Yahweh your God’s eyes. \n"
    29: '²⁹ When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations from before you where you go
      in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land, '
    30: '³⁰ be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed
      from before you, and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, “How do
      these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.” '
    31: '³¹ You shall not do so to Yahweh your God; for every abomination to Yahweh,
      which he hates, they have done to their gods; for they even burn their sons
      and their daughters in the fire to their gods. '
    32: ³² Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not
      add to it, nor take away from it.
  13:
    1: '¹ If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you, and he gives you a
      sign or a wonder, '
    2: '² and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying,
      “Let’s go after other gods” (which you have not known) “and let’s serve them,” '
    3: '³ you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of
      dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh
      your God with all your heart and with all your soul. '
    4: '⁴ You shall walk after Yahweh your God, fear him, keep his commandments, and
      obey his voice. You shall serve him, and cling to him. '
    5: "⁵ That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because\
      \ he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the\
      \ land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside\
      \ out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall\
      \ remove the evil from among you. \n"
    6: '⁶ If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter,
      or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you
      secretly, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods”—which you have not known,
      you, nor your fathers; '
    7: '⁷ of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from
      you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth— '
    8: '⁸ you shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity
      him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him; '
    9: '⁹ but you shall surely kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him
      to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw
      you away from Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out
      of the house of bondage. '
    11: "¹¹ All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness\
      \ like this among you. \n"
    12: '¹² If you hear about one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you
      to dwell there, that '
    13: '¹³ certain wicked fellows have gone out from among you and have drawn away
      the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods,” which
      you have not known, '
    14: '¹⁴ then you shall inquire, investigate, and ask diligently. Behold, if it
      is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done among you, '
    15: '¹⁵ you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of
      the sword, destroying it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock,
      with the edge of the sword. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall gather all its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall
      burn with fire the city, with all of its plunder, to Yahweh your God. It shall
      be a heap forever. It shall not be built again. '
    17: '¹⁷ Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand, that Yahweh may
      turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy, and have compassion
      on you and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers, '
    18: ¹⁸ when you listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep all his commandments
      which I command you today, to do that which is right in Yahweh your God’s eyes.
  14:
    1: '¹ You are the children of Yahweh your God. You shall not cut yourselves, nor
      make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. '
    2: "² For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you\
      \ to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face\
      \ of the earth. \n"
    3: '³ You shall not eat any abominable thing. '
    4: '⁴ These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, '
    5: '⁵ the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope,
      and the chamois. '
    6: '⁶ Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof split in two and chews
      the cud, among the animals, you may eat. '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those
      who have the hoof split: the camel, the hare, and the rabbit. Because they chew
      the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you. '
    8: '⁸ The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean
      to you. You shall not eat their meat. You shall not touch their carcasses. '
    9: '⁹ These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat whatever has
      fins and scales. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall not eat whatever doesn’t have fins and scales. It is unclean
      to you. '
    11: '¹¹ Of all clean birds you may eat. '
    12: '¹² But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture,
      the osprey, '
    13: '¹³ the red kite, the falcon, the kite of any kind, '
    14: '¹⁴ every raven of any kind, '
    15: '¹⁵ the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk of any kind, '
    16: '¹⁶ the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl, '
    17: '¹⁷ the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant, '
    18: '¹⁸ the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. '
    19: '¹⁹ All winged creeping things are unclean to you. They shall not be eaten. '
    20: "²⁰ Of all clean birds you may eat. \n"
    21: "²¹ You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself. You may give it to\
      \ the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it;\
      \ or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to Yahweh your\
      \ God.\nYou shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk. \n"
    22: '²² You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes
      out of the field year by year. '
    23: '²³ You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place which he chooses to
      cause his name to dwell, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your
      oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to
      fear Yahweh your God always. '
    24: '²⁴ If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it because
      the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to set his name there is too far
      from you, when Yahweh your God blesses you, '
    25: '²⁵ then you shall turn it into money, bind up the money in your hand, and
      shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose. '
    26: '²⁶ You shall trade the money for whatever your soul desires: for cattle,
      or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks
      of you. You shall eat there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice, you
      and your household. '
    27: '²⁷ You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has
      no portion nor inheritance with you. '
    28: '²⁸ At the end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe of your
      increase in the same year, and shall store it within your gates. '
    29: ²⁹ The Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, as well
      as the foreigner living among you, the fatherless, and the widow who are within
      your gates shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God
      may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
  15:
    1: '¹ At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts. '
    2: '² This is the way it shall be done: every creditor shall release that which
      he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not require payment from his neighbor
      and his brother, because Yahweh’s release has been proclaimed. '
    3: '³ Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother,
      your hand shall release. '
    4: '⁴ However there will be no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you
      in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess) '
    5: '⁵ if only you diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to observe to
      do all this commandment which I command you today. '
    6: '⁶ For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you. You will lend to
      many nations, but you will not borrow. You will rule over many nations, but
      they will not rule over you. '
    7: '⁷ If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates
      in your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart,
      nor shut your hand from your poor brother; '
    8: '⁸ but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient
      for his need, which he lacks. '
    9: '⁹ Beware that there not be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh
      year, the year of release, is at hand,” and your eye be evil against your poor
      brother and you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be
      sin to you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give
      to him, because it is for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your
      work and in all that you put your hand to. '
    11: '¹¹ For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I command you
      to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in
      your land. '
    12: '¹² If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves
      you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. '
    13: '¹³ When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing
      floor, and out of your wine press. As Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall
      give to him. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh
      your God redeemed you. Therefore I command you this thing today. '
    16: '¹⁶ It shall be, if he tells you, “I will not go out from you,” because he
      loves you and your house, because he is well with you, '
    17: '¹⁷ then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door,
      and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall
      do likewise. '
    18: '¹⁸ It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for he
      has been double the value of a hired hand as he served you six years. Yahweh
      your God will bless you in all that you do. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd
      and of your flock to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn
      of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which
      Yahweh shall choose, you and your household. '
    21: '²¹ If it has any defect—is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you
      shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God. '
    22: '²² You shall eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall eat
      it alike, as the gazelle and as the deer. '
    23: ²³ Only you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on the ground like
      water.
  16:
    1: '¹ Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for
      in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the
      herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. '
    3: '³ You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread
      with it seven days, even the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land
      of Egypt in haste) that you may remember the day when you came out of the land
      of Egypt all the days of your life. '
    4: '⁴ No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither
      shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain
      all night until the morning. '
    5: '⁵ You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates which Yahweh
      your God gives you; '
    6: '⁶ but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to
      dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down
      of the sun, at the season that you came out of Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God chooses. In
      the morning you shall return to your tents. '
    8: "⁸ Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn\
      \ assembly to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work. \n"
    9: '⁹ You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put
      the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of
      a free will offering of your hand, which you shall give according to how Yahweh
      your God blesses you. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your daughter,
      your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates,
      the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are among you, in the place
      which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there. '
    12: "¹² You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and\
      \ do these statutes. \n"
    13: '¹³ You shall keep the feast of booths seven days, after you have gathered
      in from your threshing floor and from your wine press. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male
      servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and
      the widow who are within your gates. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which
      Yahweh chooses, because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase
      and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful. '
    16: '¹⁶ Three times in a year all of your males shall appear before Yahweh your
      God in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the
      feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths. They shall not appear before Yahweh
      empty. '
    17: '¹⁷ Every man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing
      which he has given you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your
      God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with
      righteous judgment. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall
      not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words
      of the righteous. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live and
      inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you. '
    21: '²¹ You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside
      Yahweh your God’s altar, which you shall make for yourselves. '
    22: ²² Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which Yahweh your God
      hates.
  17:
    1: "¹ You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox or a sheep in which is\
      \ a defect or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your
      God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s
      sight in transgressing his covenant, '
    3: '³ and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun, or the
      moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded, '
    4: '⁴ and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently.
      Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done
      in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing
      to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death
      with stones. '
    6: '⁶ At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall
      be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. '
    7: "⁷ The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and\
      \ afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among\
      \ you. \n"
    8: '⁸ If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and
      blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of
      controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and go up to the place
      which Yahweh your God chooses. '
    9: '⁹ You shall come to the priests who are Levites and to the judge who shall
      be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the verdict. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall
      give you from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall observe to do according
      to all that they shall teach you. '
    11: '¹¹ According to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and
      according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall
      not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand,
      nor to the left. '
    12: '¹² The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands
      to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall
      die. You shall put away the evil from Israel. '
    13: "¹³ All the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and possess
      it and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations
      that are around me,” '
    15: '¹⁵ you shall surely set him whom Yahweh your God chooses as king over yourselves.
      You shall set as king over you one from among your brothers. You may not put
      a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. '
    16: '¹⁶ Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to
      return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has
      said to you, “You shall not go back that way again.” '
    17: "¹⁷ He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away.\
      \ He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall
      write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the
      Levitical priests. '
    19: '¹⁹ It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life,
      that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law
      and these statutes, to do them; '
    20: ²⁰ that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn
      away from the commandment to the right hand, or to the left, to the end that
      he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of
      Israel.
  18:
    1: '¹ The priests and the Levites—all the tribe of Levi—shall have no portion
      nor inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by
      fire and his portion. '
    2: '² They shall have no inheritance among their brothers. Yahweh is their inheritance,
      as he has spoken to them. '
    3: '³ This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice,
      whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest: the shoulder,
      the two cheeks, and the inner parts. '
    4: '⁴ You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and
      of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep. '
    5: "⁵ For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to minister\
      \ in Yahweh’s name, him and his sons forever. \n"
    6: '⁶ If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel where he lives,
      and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose, '
    7: '⁷ then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers
      the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh. '
    8: "⁸ They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from\
      \ the sale of his family possessions. \n"
    9: '⁹ When you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall
      not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations. '
    10: '¹⁰ There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter
      to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who tells fortunes, or
      an enchanter, or a sorcerer, '
    11: '¹¹ or a charmer, or someone who consults with a familiar spirit, or a wizard,
      or a necromancer. '
    12: '¹² For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh. Because of
      these abominations, Yahweh your God drives them out from before you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall be blameless with Yahweh your God. '
    14: '¹⁴ For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practice
      sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you
      so to do. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your
      brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. '
    16: "¹⁶ This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb\
      \ in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my God’s\
      \ voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I
      will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall
      command him. '
    19: '¹⁹ It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall
      speak in my name, I will require it of him. '
    20: "²⁰ But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have\
      \ not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that\
      \ same prophet shall die.” \n"
    21: '²¹ You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has
      not spoken?” '
    22: ²² When a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor
      happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken
      it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.
  19:
    1: '¹ When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations whose land Yahweh your God gives
      you, and you succeed them and dwell in their cities and in their houses, '
    2: '² you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land,
      which Yahweh your God gives you to possess. '
    3: '³ You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land which Yahweh
      your God causes you to inherit into three parts, that every man slayer may flee
      there. '
    4: '⁴ This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live: Whoever
      kills his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him in time past— '
    5: '⁵ as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood and his
      hand swings the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle
      and hits his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and
      live. '
    6: '⁶ Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger
      is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally,
      even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves. '
    8: '⁸ If Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers,
      and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers; '
    9: '⁹ and if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today,
      to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in his ways, then you shall add three
      cities more for yourselves, in addition to these three. '
    10: '¹⁰ This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your
      land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt
      on you. '
    11: '¹¹ But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against
      him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; '
    12: '¹² then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver
      him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. '
    13: "¹³ Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from\
      \ Israel that it may go well with you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time\
      \ have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh\
      \ your God gives you to possess. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any
      sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses,
      shall a matter be established. '
    16: '¹⁶ If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against
      him of wrongdoing, '
    17: '¹⁷ then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before
      Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; '
    18: '¹⁸ and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness
      is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother, '
    19: '¹⁹ then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you
      shall remove the evil from among you. '
    20: '²⁰ Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any
      such evil among you. '
    21: '²¹ Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
      hand for hand, foot for foot.'
  20:
    1: '¹ When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots,
      and a people more numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh
      your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. '
    2: '² It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach
      and speak to the people, '
    3: '³ and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near today to battle against
      your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither
      be scared of them; '
    4: "⁴ for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your\
      \ enemies, to save you.” \n"
    5: '⁵ The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has
      built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house,
      lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. '
    6: '⁶ What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit?
      Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man
      use its fruit. '
    7: '⁷ What man is there who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has not taken
      her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another
      man take her.” '
    8: '⁸ The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What
      man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his
      house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.” '
    9: "⁹ It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that\
      \ they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace
      to it. '
    11: '¹¹ It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it
      shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers
      to you, and shall serve you. '
    12: '¹² If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then
      you shall besiege it. '
    13: '¹³ When Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every
      male of it with the edge of the sword; '
    14: '¹⁴ but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the
      city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may
      use the plunder of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which
      are not of the cities of these nations. '
    16: '¹⁶ But of the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your God gives you for
      an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes; '
    17: '¹⁷ but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite,
      the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God has commanded
      you; '
    18: '¹⁸ that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have
      done for their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your God. '
    19: '¹⁹ When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to
      take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for
      you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field
      man, that it should be besieged by you? '
    20: ²⁰ Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy
      and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war
      with you, until it falls.
  21:
    1: '¹ If someone is found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to
      possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him, '
    2: '² then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure
      to the cities which are around him who is slain. '
    3: '³ It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man
      shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with and which has
      not drawn in the yoke. '
    4: '⁴ The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running
      water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there
      in the valley. '
    5: '⁵ The priests the sons of Levi shall come near, for them Yahweh your God has
      chosen to minister to him, and to bless in Yahweh’s name; and according to their
      word shall every controversy and every assault be decided. '
    6: '⁶ All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash
      their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. '
    7: '⁷ They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither
      have our eyes seen it. '
    8: '⁸ Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow
      innocent blood among your people Israel.” The blood shall be forgiven them. '
    9: "⁹ So you shall put away the innocent blood from among you, when you shall\

    10: '¹⁰ When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers
      them into your hands and you carry them away captive, '
    11: '¹¹ and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to
      her, and desire to take her as your wife, '
    12: '¹² then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head
      and trim her nails. '
    13: '¹³ She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in
      your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you
      shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. '
    14: "¹⁴ It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go\
      \ where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall\
      \ not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and they
      have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn
      son is hers who was hated, '
    16: '¹⁶ then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which
      he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn
      before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn; '
    17: "¹⁷ but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving\
      \ him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength.\
      \ The right of the firstborn is his. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice
      of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will
      not listen to them, '
    19: '¹⁹ then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out
      to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place. '
    20: '²⁰ They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and
      rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” '
    21: "²¹ All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall\
      \ remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear. \n"
    22: '²² If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death,
      and you hang him on a tree, '
    23: ²³ his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury
      him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God. Don’t defile your

    3: '³ So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you

      this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of

    16: '¹⁶ The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to

    26: '²⁶ but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy
      of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so
      is this matter; '
    27: '²⁷ for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and
      there was no one to save her. '
    28: '²⁸ If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married,

    5: '⁵ Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn’t listen to Balaam, but Yahweh your

    21: '²¹ When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it,

    22: '²² But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you. '
    23: '²³ You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever
      you have vowed to Yahweh your God as a free will offering, which you have promised
      with your mouth, you must do. '

    5: '⁵ Your basket and your kneading trough shall be blessed. '
    6: '⁶ You shall be blessed when you come in, and you shall be blessed when you
      go out. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before
      you. They will come out against you one way, and will flee before you seven
      ways. '
    8: '⁸ Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns, and in all that you
      put your hand to. He will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives
      you. '
    9: '⁹ Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself, as he has sworn
      to you, if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and walk in his
      ways. '
    10: '¹⁰ All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by Yahweh’s
      name, and they will be afraid of you. '
    11: '¹¹ Yahweh will grant you abundant prosperity in the fruit of your body, in
      the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which
      Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you. '
    12: '¹² Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky, to give the rain
      of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You will
      lend to many nations, and you will not borrow. '
    13: '¹³ Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail. You will be above only,
      and you will not be beneath, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your
      God which I command you today, to observe and to do, '
    14: "¹⁴ and shall not turn away from any of the words which I command you today,\
      \ to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to Yahweh your God’s
      voice, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command
      you today, that all these curses will come on you and overtake you. '
    16: '¹⁶ You will be cursed in the city, and you will be cursed in the field. '
    17: '¹⁷ Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. '
    18: '¹⁸ The fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your
      livestock, and the young of your flock will be cursed. '
    19: '¹⁹ You will be cursed when you come in, and you will be cursed when you go
      out. '
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke in all that you
      put your hand to do, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly, because
      of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken me. '
    21: '²¹ Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you, until he has consumed you
      from off the land where you go in to possess it. '
    22: '²² Yahweh will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation,
      with fiery heat, with the sword, with blight, and with mildew. They will pursue
      you until you perish. '
    23: '²³ Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is
      under you will be iron. '
    24: '²⁴ Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust. It will come down
      on you from the sky, until you are destroyed. '
    25: '²⁵ Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies. You will go out
      one way against them, and will flee seven ways before them. You will be tossed
      back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    26: '²⁶ Your dead bodies will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals
      of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away. '
    27: '²⁷ Yahweh will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with the tumors, with
      the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed. '
    28: '²⁸ Yahweh will strike you with madness, with blindness, and with astonishment
      of heart. '
    29: '²⁹ You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall
      not prosper in your ways. You will only be oppressed and robbed always, and
      there will be no one to save you. '
    30: '³⁰ You will betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her. You will
      build a house, and you won’t dwell in it. You will plant a vineyard, and not
      use its fruit. '
    31: '³¹ Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of it.
      Your donkey will be violently taken away from before your face, and will not
      be restored to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have
      no one to save you. '
    32: '³² Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people. Your eyes
      will look, and fail with longing for them all day long. There will be no power
      in your hand. '
    33: '³³ A nation which you don’t know will eat the fruit of your ground and all
      of your work. You will only be oppressed and crushed always, '
    34: '³⁴ so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad. '
    35: '³⁵ Yahweh will strike you in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil,
      of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your
      head. '
    36: '³⁶ Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you will set over yourselves,
      to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers. There you will serve
      other gods of wood and stone. '
    37: '³⁷ You will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the
      peoples where Yahweh will lead you away. '
    38: '³⁸ You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in,
      for the locust will consume it. '
    39: '³⁹ You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of
      the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you won’t anoint
      yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop off. '
    41: '⁴¹ You will father sons and daughters, but they will not be yours, for they
      will go into captivity. '
    42: '⁴² Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit of your ground. '
    43: '⁴³ The foreigner who is among you will mount up above you higher and higher,
      and you will come down lower and lower. '
    44: "⁴⁴ He will lend to you, and you won’t lend to him. He will be the head, and\
      \ you will be the tail. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you,
      until you are destroyed, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice,
      to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you. '
    46: '⁴⁶ They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring
      forever. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Because you didn’t serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness and with gladness
      of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; '
    48: '⁴⁸ therefore you will serve your enemies whom Yahweh sends against you, in
      hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron
      yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth,
      as the eagle flies: a nation whose language you will not understand, '
    50: '⁵⁰ a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn’t respect the elderly,
      nor show favor to the young. '
    51: '⁵¹ They will eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground,
      until you are destroyed. They also won’t leave you grain, new wine, oil, the
      increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused
      you to perish. '
    52: '⁵² They will besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified
      walls in which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege
      you in all your gates throughout all your land which Yahweh your God has given
      you. '
    53: '⁵³ You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of
      your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the
      distress with which your enemies will distress you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil
      toward his brother, toward the wife whom he loves, and toward the remnant of
      his children whom he has remaining, '
    55: '⁵⁵ so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom
      he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress
      with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates. '
    56: '⁵⁶ The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set
      the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye
      will be evil toward the husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter, '
    57: '⁵⁷ toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her
      children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things
      in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in
      your gates. '
    58: '⁵⁸ If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written
      in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH your
      God, '
    59: '⁵⁹ then Yahweh will make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring fearful,
      even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long
      duration. '
    60: '⁶⁰ He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid
      of; and they will cling to you. '
    61: '⁶¹ Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book
      of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you until you are destroyed. '
    62: '⁶² You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the
      sky for multitude, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice. '
    63: '⁶³ It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to
      multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish and to
      destroy you. You will be plucked from the land that you are going in to possess. '
    64: '⁶⁴ Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to
      the other end of the earth. There you will serve other gods which you have not
      known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone. '
    65: '⁶⁵ Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for
      the sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing
      of eyes, and pining of soul. '
    66: '⁶⁶ Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and
      day, and will have no assurance of your life. '
    67: '⁶⁷ In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening
      you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you
      will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see. '
    68: ⁶⁸ Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which
      I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will offer yourselves
      to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you.
  29:
    1: '¹ These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make
      with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant
      which he made with them in Horeb. '
    2: "² Moses called to all Israel, and said to them:\nYour eyes have seen all that\
      \ Yahweh did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to\
      \ all his land; "
    3: '³ the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders. '
    4: '⁴ But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear,
      to this day. '
    5: '⁵ I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown
      old on you, and your sandals have not grown old on your feet. '
    6: '⁶ You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that
      you may know that I am Yahweh your God. '
    7: '⁷ When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of
      Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them. '
    8: '⁸ We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and
      to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper
      in all that you do. '
    10: '¹⁰ All of you stand today in the presence of Yahweh your God: your heads,
      your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, '
    11: '¹¹ your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle
      of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water, '
    12: '¹² that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his
      oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you today, '
    13: '¹³ that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your
      God, as he spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
      and to Jacob. '
    14: '¹⁴ Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only, '
    15: '¹⁵ but with those who stand here with us today before Yahweh our God, and
      also with those who are not here with us today '
    16: '¹⁶ (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through
      the middle of the nations through which you passed; '
    17: '¹⁷ and you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver,
      and gold, which were among them); '
    18: '¹⁸ lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart
      turns away today from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations;
      lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison; '
    19: '¹⁹ and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself
      in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness
      of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry. '
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will
      smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will
      fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky. '
    21: "²¹ Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according\
      \ to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. \n"
    22: '²² The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the
      foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues
      of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick, '
    23: '²³ that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown,
      doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom,
      Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his
      wrath. '
    24: "²⁴ Even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done this to this land?\
      \ What does the heat of this great anger mean?” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the
      God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the
      land of Egypt, '
    26: '²⁶ and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t
      know and that he had not given to them. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all
      the curses that are written in this book. '
    28: "²⁸ Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great\
      \ indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” \n"
    29: ²⁹ The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed
      belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this
      law.
  30:
    1: '¹ It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and
      the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among
      all the nations where Yahweh your God has driven you, '
    2: '² and return to Yahweh your God and obey his voice according to all that I
      command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your
      soul, '
    3: '³ that then Yahweh your God will release you from captivity, have compassion
      on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your
      God has scattered you. '
    4: '⁴ If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there Yahweh
      your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. '
    5: '⁵ Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed,
      and you will possess it. He will do you good, and increase your numbers more
      than your fathers. '
    6: '⁶ Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring,
      to love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you
      may live. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who
      hate you, who persecuted you. '
    8: '⁸ You shall return and obey Yahweh’s voice, and do all his commandments which
      I command you today. '
    9: '⁹ Yahweh your God will make you prosperous in all the work of your hand, in
      the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of
      your ground, for good; for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he
      rejoiced over your fathers, '
    10: "¹⁰ if you will obey Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep his commandments and\
      \ his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh\
      \ your God with all your heart and with all your soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you
      or too distant. '
    12: '¹² It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven,
      bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” '
    13: '¹³ Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the
      sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” '
    14: '¹⁴ But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that
      you may do it. '
    15: '¹⁵ Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and
      evil. '
    16: '¹⁶ For I command you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways and
      to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live
      and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go
      in to possess it. '
    17: '¹⁷ But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away
      and worship other gods, and serve them, '
    18: '¹⁸ I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong
      your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. '
    19: '¹⁹ I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before
      you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that
      you may live, you and your descendants, '
    20: ²⁰ to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he
      is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which
      Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
  31:
    1: '¹ Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. '
    2: '² He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old today. I can no more
      go out and come in. Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’ '
    3: '³ Yahweh your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations
      from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you,
      as Yahweh has spoken. '
    4: '⁴ Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites,
      and to their land, when he destroyed them. '
    5: '⁵ Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according
      to all the commandment which I have commanded you. '
    6: "⁶ Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them; for Yahweh\
      \ your God himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be
      strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which
      Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to
      inherit it. '
    8: "⁸ Yahweh himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not\
      \ fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who
      bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the
      set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, '
    11: '¹¹ when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place
      which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. '
    12: '¹² Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the
      foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh
      your God, and observe to do all the words of this law, '
    13: "¹³ and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear\
      \ Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan\
      \ to possess it.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call\
      \ Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission\
      \ him.”\nMoses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud
      stood over the Tent’s door. '
    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This
      people will rise up and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land
      where they go to be among them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which
      I have made with them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake
      them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many
      evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t
      these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’ '
    18: "¹⁸ I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have\
      \ done, in that they have turned to other gods. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children
      of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against
      the children of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers,
      flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and
      grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,
      and break my covenant. '
    21: "²¹ It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this\
      \ song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out\
      \ of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are\
      \ doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.”\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of\
      \ Israel. \n"
    23: "²³ He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous;\
      \ for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to\
      \ them. I will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until
      they were finished, '
    25: '²⁵ Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh
      your God’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you. '
    27: '²⁷ For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet
      alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more
      after my death? '
    28: '²⁸ Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I
      may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against
      them. '
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and\
      \ turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to\
      \ you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s\
      \ sight, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.” \n"
    30: ³⁰ Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this
      song, until they were finished.
  32:
    1: "¹ Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.\n    Let the earth hear the words\
      \ of my mouth.\n"
    2: "² My doctrine will drop as the rain.\n    My speech will condense as the dew,\n\
      \    as the misty rain on the tender grass,\n    as the showers on the herb.\n"
    3: "³ For I will proclaim Yahweh’s name.\n    Ascribe greatness to our God!\n"
    4: "⁴ The Rock: his work is perfect,\n    for all his ways are just.\n    A God\
      \ of faithfulness who does no wrong,\n    just and right is he.\n"
    5: "⁵ They have dealt corruptly with him.\n    They are not his children, because\
      \ of their defect.\n    They are a perverse and crooked generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is this the way you repay Yahweh,\n    foolish and unwise people?\nIsn’t\
      \ he your father who has bought you?\n    He has made you and established you.\n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of old.\n    Consider the years of many generations.\n\
      Ask your father, and he will show you;\n    your elders, and they will tell\
      \ you.\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,\n    when he separated\
      \ the children of men,\nhe set the bounds of the peoples\n    according to the\
      \ number of the children of Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ For Yahweh’s portion is his people.\n    Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He found him in a desert land,\n    in the waste howling wilderness.\n\
      He surrounded him.\n    He cared for him.\n    He kept him as the apple of his\
      \ eye.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As an eagle that stirs up her nest,\n    that flutters over her young,\n\
      he spread abroad his wings,\n    he took them,\n    he bore them on his feathers.\n"
    12: "¹² Yahweh alone led him.\n    There was no foreign god with him.\n"
    13: "¹³ He made him ride on the high places of the earth.\n    He ate the increase\
      \ of the field.\nHe caused him to suck honey out of the rock,\n    oil out of\
      \ the flinty rock;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ butter from the herd, and milk from the flock,\n    with fat of lambs,\n\
      \    rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,\n    with the finest of the wheat.\n\
      \    From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.\n    You have grown fat.\n    You have\
      \ grown thick.\n    You have become sleek.\nThen he abandoned God who made him,\n\
      \    and rejected the Rock of his salvation.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They moved him to jealousy with strange gods.\n    They provoked him to\
      \ anger with abominations.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They sacrificed to demons, not God,\n    to gods that they didn’t know,\n\
      \    to new gods that came up recently,\n    which your fathers didn’t dread.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,\n    and have forgotten\
      \ God who gave you birth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yahweh saw and abhorred,\n    because of the provocation of his sons and\
      \ his daughters.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He said, “I will hide my face from them.\n    I will see what their end\
      \ will be;\nfor they are a very perverse generation,\n    children in whom is\
      \ no faithfulness.\n"
    21: "²¹ They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.\n    They have\
      \ provoked me to anger with their vanities.\nI will move them to jealousy with\
      \ those who are not a people.\n    I will provoke them to anger with a foolish\
      \ nation.\n"
    22: "²² For a fire is kindled in my anger,\n    that burns to the lowest Sheol,\n\
      \    devours the earth with its increase,\n    and sets the foundations of the\
      \ mountains on fire. \n"
    23: "²³ “I will heap evils on them.\n    I will spend my arrows on them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ They shall be wasted with hunger,\n    and devoured with burning heat\n\
      \    and bitter destruction.\nI will send the teeth of animals on them,\n  \
      \  with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Outside the sword will bereave,\n    and in the rooms,\n    terror on\
      \ both young man and virgin,\n    the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I said that I would scatter them afar.\n    I would make their memory\
      \ to cease from among men;\n"
    27: "²⁷ were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,\n    lest their\
      \ adversaries should judge wrongly,\n    lest they should say, ‘Our hand is\
      \ exalted,\n    Yahweh has not done all this.’” \n"
    28: "²⁸ For they are a nation void of counsel.\n    There is no understanding\
      \ in them.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,\n    that they would\
      \ consider their latter end!\n"
    30: "³⁰ How could one chase a thousand,\n    and two put ten thousand to flight,\n\
      unless their Rock had sold them,\n    and Yahweh had delivered them up?\n"
    31: "³¹ For their rock is not as our Rock,\n    even our enemies themselves concede.\n"
    32: "³² For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,\n    of the fields of Gomorrah.\n\
      Their grapes are poison grapes.\n    Their clusters are bitter.\n"
    33: "³³ Their wine is the poison of serpents,\n    the cruel venom of asps. \n"
    34: "³⁴ “Isn’t this laid up in store with me,\n    sealed up among my treasures?\n"
    35: "³⁵ Vengeance is mine, and recompense,\n    at the time when their foot slides;\n\
      for the day of their calamity is at hand.\n    Their doom rushes at them.” \n"
    36: "³⁶ For Yahweh will judge his people,\n    and have compassion on his servants,\n\
      when he sees that their power is gone;\n    that there is no one remaining,\
      \ shut up or left at large.\n"
    37: "³⁷ He will say, “Where are their gods,\n    the rock in which they took refuge;\n"
    38: "³⁸ which ate the fat of their sacrifices,\n    and drank the wine of their\
      \ drink offering?\nLet them rise up and help you!\n    Let them be your protection.\
      \ \n"
    39: "³⁹ “See now that I myself am he.\n    There is no god with me.\nI kill and\
      \ I make alive.\n    I wound and I heal.\n    There is no one who can deliver\
      \ out of my hand.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare,\n    as I live forever,\n"
    41: "⁴¹ if I sharpen my glittering sword,\n    my hand grasps it in judgment;\n\
      I will take vengeance on my adversaries,\n    and will repay those who hate\
      \ me.\n"
    42: "⁴² I will make my arrows drunk with blood.\n    My sword shall devour flesh\
      \ with the blood of the slain and the captives,\n    from the head of the leaders\
      \ of the enemy.” \n"
    43: "⁴³ Rejoice, you nations, with his people,\n    for he will avenge the blood\
      \ of his servants.\n    He will take vengeance on his adversaries,\n    and\
      \ will make atonement for his land and for his people. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people,
      he and Joshua the son of Nun. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel. '
    46: '⁴⁶ He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you
      today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words
      of this law. '
    47: "⁴⁷ For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through\
      \ this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the\
      \ Jordan to possess it.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying, '
    49: '⁴⁹ “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land
      of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give
      to the children of Israel for a possession. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as
      Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people; '
    51: '⁵¹ because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the
      waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold
      my holiness among the children of Israel. '
    52: ⁵² For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there
      into the land which I give the children of Israel.”
  33:
    1: '¹ This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children
      of Israel before his death. '
    2: "² He said,\n“Yahweh came from Sinai,\n    and rose from Seir to them.\nHe\
      \ shone from Mount Paran.\n    He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.\n\
      \    At his right hand was a fiery law for them.\n"
    3: "³ Yes, he loves the people.\n    All his saints are in your hand.\n    They\
      \ sat down at your feet.\n    Each receives your words.\n"
    4: "⁴ Moses commanded us a law,\n    an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.\n"
    5: "⁵ He was king in Jeshurun,\n    when the heads of the people were gathered,\n\
      \    all the tribes of Israel together. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Let Reuben live, and not die;\n    Nor let his men be few.” \n"
    7: "⁷ This is for Judah. He said,\n“Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah.\n    Bring\
      \ him in to his people.\nWith his hands he contended for himself.\n    You shall\
      \ be a help against his adversaries.” \n"
    8: "⁸ About Levi he said,\n“Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,\n\
      \    whom you proved at Massah,\n    with whom you contended at the waters of\
      \ Meribah.\n"
    9: "⁹ He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’\n    He\
      \ didn’t acknowledge his brothers,\n    nor did he know his own children;\n\
      for they have observed your word,\n    and keep your covenant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,\n    and Israel your law.\nThey\
      \ shall put incense before you,\n    and whole burnt offering on your altar.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Yahweh, bless his skills.\n    Accept the work of his hands.\nStrike through\

      \ they not rise again.” \n"
    12: "¹² About Benjamin he said,\n“The beloved of Yahweh will dwell in safety by\

    18: "¹⁸ About Zebulun he said,\n“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;\n    and\

      \ \n"
    23: "²³ About Naphtali he said,\n“Naphtali, satisfied with favor,\n    full of\

  34:
    1: '¹ Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
