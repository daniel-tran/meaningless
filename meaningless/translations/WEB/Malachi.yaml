Malachi:
  1:
    1: "¹ A revelation, Yahweh’s word to Israel by Malachi. \n"
    2: "² “I have loved you,” says Yahweh.\nYet you say, “How have you loved us?”\n\
      “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob; "
    3: '³ but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage
      to the jackals of the wilderness.” '
    4: "⁴ Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the\
      \ waste places;” Yahweh of Armies says, “They shall build, but I will throw\
      \ down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom\
      \ Yahweh shows wrath forever.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border\
      \ of Israel!” \n"
    6: '⁶ “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then
      where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh
      of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised
      your name?’ '
    7: '⁷ You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’
      In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is contemptible.’ '
    8: "⁸ When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer\
      \ the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will\
      \ he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ “Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With\
      \ this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might
      not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh
      of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand. '
    11: '¹¹ For from the rising of the sun even to its going down, my name is great
      among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and
      a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies. '
    12: '¹² “But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and
      its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’ '
    13: "¹³ You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at\
      \ it”, says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by\
      \ violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept\
      \ this at your hand?” says Yahweh. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ “But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and
      sacrifices to the Lord a defective thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh
      of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”
  2:
    1: '¹ “Now, you priests, this commandment is for you. '
    2: '² If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart, to give glory
      to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then I will send the curse on you, and
      I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you
      do not take it to heart. '
    3: '³ Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and will spread dung on your faces,
      even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it. '
    4: '⁴ You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant
      may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies. '
    5: '⁵ “My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that
      he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in
      awe of my name. '
    6: '⁶ The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in
      his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from
      iniquity. '
    7: '⁷ For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law
      at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies. '
    8: '⁸ But you have turned away from the path. You have caused many to stumble
      in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies. '
    9: '⁹ “Therefore I have also made you contemptible and wicked before all the people,
      according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons
      in the law. '
    10: '¹⁰ Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal
      treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? '
    11: '¹¹ Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel
      and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves,
      and has married the daughter of a foreign god. '
    12: '¹² Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who
      answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh
      of Armies. '
    13: '¹³ This again you do: you cover Yahweh’s altar with tears, with weeping,
      and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives
      it with good will at your hand. '
    14: '¹⁴ Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the
      wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is
      your companion, and the wife of your covenant. '
    15: '¹⁵ Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why
      one? He sought godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let
      no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. '
    16: '¹⁶ One who hates and divorces”, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “covers his
      garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore pay attention to your
      spirit, that you don’t be unfaithful. '
    17: ¹⁷ You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied
      him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in Yahweh’s sight, and
      he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’
  3:
    1: '¹ “Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and
      the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger
      of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies. '
    2: '² “But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears?
      For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap; '
    3: '³ and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify
      the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to
      Yahweh offerings in righteousness. '
    4: '⁴ Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as
      in the days of old, and as in ancient years. '
    5: '⁵ I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against
      the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against
      those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless,
      and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of
      Armies. '
    6: '⁶ “For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed. '
    7: '⁷ From the days of your fathers you have turned away from my ordinances, and
      have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of
      Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ '
    8: '⁸ Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’
      In tithes and offerings. '
    9: '⁹ You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation. '
    10: '¹⁰ Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my
      house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open
      you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there will not
      be room enough for. '
    11: '¹¹ I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the
      fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time
      in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies. '
    12: "¹² “All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,”\
      \ says Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What
      have we spoken against you?’ '
    14: '¹⁴ You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that
      we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before
      Yahweh of Armies? '
    15: '¹⁵ Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built
      up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened,
      and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared
      Yahweh, and who honored his name. '
    17: '¹⁷ They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the
      day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves
      him. '
    18: ¹⁸ Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked,
      between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him.
  4:
    1: '¹ “For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and
      all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them
      up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. '
    2: '² But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing
      in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall. '
    3: "³ You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles\
      \ of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb
      for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances. '
    5: '⁵ Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible
      day of Yahweh comes. '
    6: ⁶ He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of
      the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”
