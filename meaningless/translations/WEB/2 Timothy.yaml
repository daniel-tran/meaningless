2 Timothy:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the
      promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, '
    2: "² to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father\
      \ and Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"
    3: '³ I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience.
      How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day '
    4: '⁴ longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; '
    5: "⁵ having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first\
      \ in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in\
      \ you also. \n"
    6: '⁶ For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which
      is in you through the laying on of my hands. '
    7: '⁷ For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. '
    8: '⁸ Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner;
      but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, '
    9: '⁹ who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works,
      but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ
      Jesus before times eternal, '
    10: '¹⁰ but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,
      who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good
      News. '
    11: '¹¹ For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the
      Gentiles. '
    12: "¹² For this cause I also suffer these things.\nYet I am not ashamed, for\
      \ I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard\
      \ that which I have committed to him against that day. \n"
    13: '¹³ Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith
      and love which is in Christ Jesus. '
    14: "¹⁴ That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit\
      \ who dwells in us. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are
      Phygelus and Hermogenes. '
    16: '¹⁶ May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed
      me, and was not ashamed of my chain, '
    17: '¹⁷ but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me '
    18: ¹⁸ (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how
      many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.
  2:
    1: '¹ You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ
      Jesus. '
    2: '² The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the
      same things to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. '
    3: '³ You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. '
    4: '⁴ No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may
      please him who enrolled him as a soldier. '
    5: '⁵ Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed
      by the rules. '
    6: '⁶ The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. '
    7: "⁷ Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according
      to my Good News, '
    9: '⁹ in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s
      word isn’t chained. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also
      may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. '
    11: "¹¹ This saying is trustworthy:\n“For if we died with him,\n    we will also\
      \ live with him.\n"
    12: "¹² If we endure,\n    we will also reign with him.\nIf we deny him,\n   \
      \ he also will deny us.\n"
    13: "¹³ If we are faithless,\n    he remains faithful;\n    for he can’t deny\
      \ himself.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that\
      \ they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who\
      \ hear. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t
      need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. '
    16: '¹⁶ But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, '
    17: '¹⁷ and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: '
    18: '¹⁸ men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection
      is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. '
    19: '¹⁹ However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows
      those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart
      from unrighteousness.” '
    20: '²⁰ Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,
      but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor. '
    21: "²¹ If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for\
      \ honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good\
      \ work. \n"
    22: '²² Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace
      with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. '
    23: '²³ But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate
      strife. '
    24: '²⁴ The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to
      teach, patient, '
    25: '²⁵ in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them
      repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, '
    26: ²⁶ and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken
      captive by him to his will.
  3:
    1: '¹ But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. '
    2: '² For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers,
      disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, '
    3: '³ without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control,
      fierce, not lovers of good, '
    4: '⁴ traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of
      God, '
    5: '⁵ holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from
      these, also. '
    6: '⁶ For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible
      women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, '
    7: '⁷ always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. '
    8: '⁸ Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth,
      men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. '
    9: '⁹ But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all
      men, as theirs also came to be. '
    10: '¹⁰ But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love,
      steadfastness, '
    11: '¹¹ persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch,
      Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out
      of them all. '
    12: '¹² Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. '
    13: '¹³ But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being
      deceived. '
    14: '¹⁴ But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured
      of, knowing from whom you have learned them. '
    15: '¹⁵ From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make
      you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. '
    16: '¹⁶ Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, '
    17: ¹⁷ that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
      for every good work.
  4:
    1: '¹ I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge
      the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: '
    2: '² preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,
      and exhort with all patience and teaching. '
    3: '³ For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine,
      but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own
      lusts, '
    4: '⁴ and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. '
    5: "⁵ But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist,\
      \ and fulfill your ministry. \n"
    6: '⁶ For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. '
    7: '⁷ I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the
      faith. '
    8: "⁸ From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord,\
      \ the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but\
      \ also to all those who have loved his appearing. \n"
    9: '⁹ Be diligent to come to me soon, '
    10: '¹⁰ for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica;
      Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. '
    11: '¹¹ Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful
      to me for service. '
    12: '¹² But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. '
    13: '¹³ Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the
      books, especially the parchments. '
    14: '¹⁴ Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him
      according to his deeds, '
    15: "¹⁵ of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not
      be held against them. '
    17: '¹⁷ But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message
      might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered
      out of the mouth of the lion. '
    18: "¹⁸ And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me\
      \ for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. '
    20: '²⁰ Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. '
    21: "²¹ Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens,\
      \ Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. \n"
    22: ²² The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
