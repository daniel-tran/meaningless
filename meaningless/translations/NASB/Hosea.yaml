Hosea:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days\
      \ of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days\
      \ of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. \n"
    2: '² When the Lord first spoke through Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea, “Go, take
      for yourself a wife inclined to infidelity, and children of infidelity; for
      the land commits flagrant infidelity, abandoning the Lord.” '
    3: '³ So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and
      bore him a son. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in just a little while
      I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put
      an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said
      to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer take pity on the house of
      Israel, that I would ever forgive them. '
    7: "⁷ But I will take pity on the house of Judah and save them by the Lord their\
      \ God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” \n"
    8: '⁸ When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. '
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi, because you are not My people, and\
      \ I am not your God.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet the number of the sons of Israel\nWill be like the sand of the sea,\n\
      Which cannot be measured or counted;\nAnd in the place\nWhere it is said to\
      \ them,\n“You are not My people,”\nIt will be said to them,\n“You are the sons\
      \ of the living God.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together,\n\
      And they will appoint for themselves one leader,\nAnd they will go up from the\
      \ land,\nFor the day of Jezreel will be great."
  2:
    1: "¹ Say to your brothers, “Ammi,” and to your sisters, “Ruhamah.” \n"
    2: "² “Dispute with your mother, dispute,\nBecause she is not my wife, and I am\
      \ not her husband;\nBut she must remove her infidelity from her face\nAnd her\
      \ adultery from between her breasts,\n"
    3: "³ Otherwise, I will strip her naked\nAnd expose her as on the day she was\
      \ born.\nI will also make her like a wilderness,\nMake her like desert land,\n\
      And put her to death with thirst.\n"
    4: "⁴ Also, I will take no pity on her children,\nBecause they are children of\
      \ infidelity.\n"
    5: "⁵ For their mother has committed prostitution;\nShe who conceived them has\
      \ acted shamefully.\nFor she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,\nWho give me\
      \ my bread and my water,\nMy wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore, behold, I will obstruct her way with thorns,\nAnd I will build\
      \ a stone wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.\n"
    7: "⁷ And she will pursue her lovers, but she will not reach them;\nAnd she will\
      \ seek them, but will not find them.\nThen she will say, ‘I will go back to\
      \ my first husband,\nBecause it was better for me then than now!’ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Yet she does not know that it was I myself who gave her the grain, the\
      \ new wine, and the oil,\nAnd lavished on her silver and gold,\nWhich they used\
      \ for Baal.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time\nAnd My new wine in\
      \ its season.\nI will also take away My wool and My flax\nThat I gave to cover\
      \ her nakedness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So now I will uncover her lewdness\nBefore the eyes of her lovers,\nAnd\
      \ no one will rescue her from My hand.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will also put an end to all her joy,\nHer feasts, her new moons, her\
      \ Sabbaths,\nAnd all her festivals.\n"
    12: "¹² And I will destroy her vines and fig trees,\nOf which she said, ‘They\
      \ are my wages for prostitution\nWhich my lovers have given me.’\nAnd I will\
      \ turn them into a forest,\nAnd the animals of the field will devour them.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will punish her for the days of the Baals\nWhen she used to offer sacrifices\
      \ to them\nAnd adorn herself with her nose ring and jewelry,\nAnd follow her\
      \ lovers, so that she forgot Me,” declares the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Therefore, behold, I am going to persuade her,\nBring her into the wilderness,\n\
      And speak kindly to her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then I will give her her vineyards from there,\nAnd the Valley of Achor\
      \ as a door of hope.\nAnd she will respond there as in the days of her youth,\n\
      As in the day when she went up from the land of Egypt.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And it will come about on that day,” declares the Lord,\n“That you will\
      \ call Me my husband\nAnd no longer call Me my Baal.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth,\nSo that they\
      \ will no longer be mentioned by their names.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ On that day I will also make a covenant for them\nWith the animals of\
      \ the field,\nThe birds of the sky,\nAnd the crawling things of the ground.\n\
      And I will eliminate the bow, the sword, and war from the land,\nAnd will let\
      \ them lie down in safety.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will betroth you to Me forever;\nYes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness\
      \ and in justice,\nIn favor and in compassion,\n"
    20: "²⁰ And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness.\nThen you will know the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ “And it will come about on that day that I will respond,” declares the\
      \ Lord.\n“I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth,\n"
    22: "²² And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine, and to the oil,\n\
      And they will respond to Jezreel.\n"
    23: "²³ I will sow her for Myself in the land.\nI will also have compassion on\
      \ her who had not obtained compassion,\nAnd I will say to those who were not\
      \ My people,\n‘You are My people!’\nAnd they will say, ‘You are my God!’”"
  3:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband,
      yet is committing adultery, as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, though they
      turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.” '
    2: '² So I purchased her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and a homer
      and a lethech of barley. '
    3: '³ Then I said to her, “You shall live with me for many days. You shall not
      play the prostitute, nor shall you have another man; so I will also be toward
      you.” '
    4: '⁴ For the sons of Israel will live for many days without a king or leader,
      without sacrifice or memorial stone, and without ephod or household idols. '
    5: ⁵ Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and
      David their king; and they will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness
      in the last days.
  4:
    1: "¹ Listen to the word of the Lord, you sons of Israel,\nBecause the Lord has\
      \ a case against the inhabitants of the land,\nFor there is no faithfulness,\
      \ nor loyalty,\nNor knowledge of God in the land.\n"
    2: "² There is oath-taking, denial, murder, stealing, and adultery.\nThey employ\
      \ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the land mourns,\nAnd everyone who lives in it languishes\nAlong\
      \ with the animals of the field and the birds of the sky,\nAnd even the fish\
      \ of the sea disappear. \n"
    4: "⁴ Yet let no one find fault, and let no one rebuke;\nFor your people are like\
      \ those who contend with a priest.\n"
    5: "⁵ So you will stumble by day,\nAnd the prophet also will stumble with you\
      \ by night;\nAnd I will destroy your mother.\n"
    6: "⁶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\nSince you have rejected\
      \ knowledge,\nI also will reject you from being My priest.\nSince you have forgotten\
      \ the Law of your God,\nI also will forget your children. \n"
    7: "⁷ The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me;\nI will change\
      \ their glory into shame.\n"
    8: "⁸ They feed on the sin of My people,\nAnd long for their wrongdoing.\n"
    9: "⁹ And it will be, like people, like priest;\nSo I will punish them for their\
      \ ways\nAnd repay them for their deeds.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They will eat, but not have enough;\nThey will play the prostitute, but\
      \ not increase,\nBecause they gave up devoting themselves to the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Infidelity, wine, and new wine take away the understanding.\n"
    12: "¹² My people consult their wooden idol, and their diviner’s wand informs\
      \ them;\nFor a spirit of infidelity has led them astray,\nAnd they have been\
      \ unfaithful, departing from their God.\n"
    13: "¹³ They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains\nAnd burn incense on\
      \ the hills,\nUnder oak, poplar, and terebinth,\nBecause their shade is pleasant.\n\
      Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,\nAnd your brides commit adultery.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,\nOr your\
      \ brides when they commit adultery,\nBecause the men themselves slip away with\
      \ the prostitutes\nAnd offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes;\nSo the people\
      \ without understanding are ruined. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,\nJudah must not become guilty;\n\
      Also you are not to go to Gilgal,\nNor go up to Beth-aven\nAnd take the oath:\n\
      “As the Lord lives!”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Since Israel is stubborn\nLike a stubborn cow,\nWill the Lord now pasture\
      \ them\nLike a lamb in a large field?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ephraim is allied with idols;\nLeave him alone.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their liquor is gone,\nThey prostitute themselves continually;\nTheir\
      \ rulers dearly love shame.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The wind wraps them in its wings,\nAnd they will be put to shame because\
      \ of their sacrifices."
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this, you priests!\nPay attention, house of Israel!\nListen, you of\
      \ the house of the king!\nFor the judgment applies to you,\nBecause you have\
      \ been a trap at Mizpah,\nAnd a net spread out on Tabor.\n"
    2: "² And the rebels have gone deep in depravity,\nBut I will discipline all of\
      \ them.\n"
    3: "³ I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me;\nBecause now, Ephraim,\
      \ you have been unfaithful,\nIsrael has defiled itself.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their deeds will not allow them\nTo return to their God.\nFor a spirit of\
      \ infidelity is within them,\nAnd they do not know the Lord.\n"
    5: "⁵ Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him,\nAnd Israel and Ephraim\
      \ stumble in their wrongdoing;\nJudah also has stumbled with them.\n"
    6: "⁶ They will go with their flocks and herds\nTo seek the Lord, but they will\
      \ not find Him;\nHe has withdrawn from them.\n"
    7: "⁷ They have dealt treacherously with the Lord,\nFor they have given birth\
      \ to illegitimate children.\nNow the new moon will devour them with their land.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Blow the horn in Gibeah,\nAnd the trumpet in Ramah.\nSound an alarm at Beth-aven:\n\
      “Behind you, Benjamin!”\n"
    9: "⁹ Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke;\nAmong the tribes\
      \ of Israel I make known what is trustworthy.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The leaders of Judah have become like those who displace a boundary marker;\n\
      On them I will pour out My anger like water.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim is oppressed, broken by judgment,\nBecause he was determined to\
      \ follow man’s command.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim,\nAnd like rottenness to the house\
      \ of Judah.\n"
    13: "¹³ When Ephraim saw his sickness,\nAnd Judah his sore,\nEphraim then went\
      \ to Assyria\nAnd sent word to King Jareb.\nBut he is unable to heal you,\n\
      Or to cure you of your sore.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For I will be like a lion to Ephraim\nAnd like a young lion to the house\
      \ of Judah.\nI, yes I, will tear to pieces and go away,\nI will carry away,\
      \ and there will be no one to rescue.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will go away and return to My place\nUntil they acknowledge their guilt\
      \ and seek My face;\nIn their distress they will search for Me."
  6:
    1: "¹ “Come, let’s return to the Lord.\nFor He has torn us, but He will heal us;\n\
      He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.\n"
    2: "² He will revive us after two days;\nHe will raise us up on the third day,\n\
      That we may live before Him.\n"
    3: "³ So let’s learn, let’s press on to know the Lord.\nHis appearance is as sure\
      \ as the dawn;\nAnd He will come to us like the rain,\nAs the spring rain waters\
      \ the earth.” \n"
    4: "⁴ What shall I do with you, Ephraim?\nWhat shall I do with you, Judah?\nFor\
      \ your loyalty is like a morning cloud,\nAnd like the dew which goes away early.\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore I have cut them in pieces by the prophets;\nI have slain them\
      \ by the words of My mouth;\nAnd the judgments on you are like the light that\
      \ shines.\n"
    6: "⁶ For I desire loyalty rather than sacrifice,\nAnd the knowledge of God rather\
      \ than burnt offerings.\n"
    7: "⁷ But like Adam they have violated the covenant;\nThere they have dealt treacherously\
      \ with Me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Gilead is a city of wrongdoers,\nTracked with bloody footprints.\n"
    9: "⁹ And as a band of robbers lie in wait for a person,\nSo a band of priests\
      \ murder on the way to Shechem;\nCertainly they have committed an act of infamy.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;\nEphraim’s infidelity\
      \ is there, Israel has defiled itself.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,\nWhen I restore the\
      \ fortunes of My people."
  7:
    1: "¹ When I would heal Israel,\nThe wrongdoing of Ephraim is uncovered,\nAnd\
      \ the evil deeds of Samaria,\nFor they practice deception;\nThe thief enters,\n\
      A band of robbers attack outside,\n"
    2: "² And they do not consider in their hearts\nThat I remember all their wickedness.\n\
      Now their deeds surround them;\nThey are before My face.\n"
    3: "³ With their wickedness they make the king happy,\nAnd the officials with\
      \ their lies.\n"
    4: "⁴ They are all adulterers,\nLike an oven heated by the baker,\nWho stops stoking\
      \ the fire\nFrom the time the dough is kneaded until it is leavened.\n"
    5: "⁵ On the day of our king, the officials became sick with the heat of wine;\n\
      He stretched out his hand with scoffers,\n"
    6: "⁶ For their hearts are like an oven\nAs they approach their plotting;\nTheir\
      \ anger smolders all night,\nIn the morning it burns like flaming fire.\n"
    7: "⁷ All of them are hot like an oven,\nAnd they consume their rulers;\nAll their\
      \ kings have fallen.\nNone of them calls on Me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Ephraim is himself thrown about with the nations;\nEphraim has become a\
      \ round loaf not turned over.\n"
    9: "⁹ Strangers devour his strength,\nYet he does not know it;\nGray hairs also\
      \ are sprinkled on him,\nYet he does not know it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Though the pride of Israel testifies against him,\nYet they have not returned\
      \ to the Lord their God,\nNor have they sought Him, despite all this.\n"
    11: "¹¹ So Ephraim has become like a gullible dove, without sense;\nThey call\
      \ to Egypt, they go to Assyria.\n"
    12: "¹² When they go, I will spread My net over them;\nI will bring them down\
      \ like the birds of the sky.\nI will discipline them in accordance with the\
      \ proclamation to their assembly.\n"
    13: "¹³ Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me!\nDestruction is theirs, for\
      \ they have rebelled against Me!\nI would redeem them, but they have spoken\
      \ lies against Me.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And they do not cry to Me from their heart\nWhen they wail on their beds;\n\
      For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves,\nThey turn against\
      \ Me.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Although I trained and strengthened their arms,\nYet they devise evil\
      \ against Me.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They turn, but not upward,\nThey are like a loose bow;\nTheir officials\
      \ will fall by the sword\nBecause of the insolence of their tongue.\nThis will\
      \ be their derision in the land of Egypt."
  8:
    1: "¹ Put the trumpet to your lips!\nLike an eagle the enemy comes against the\
      \ house of the Lord,\nBecause they have violated My covenant\nAnd rebelled against\
      \ My Law.\n"
    2: "² They cry out to Me,\n“My God, we of Israel know You!”\n"
    3: "³ Israel has rejected the good;\nThe enemy will pursue him.\n"
    4: "⁴ They have set up kings, but not by Me;\nThey have appointed officials, but\
      \ I did not know it.\nWith their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves,\n\
      So that they will be eliminated.\n"
    5: "⁵ He has rejected your calf, Samaria, saying,\n“My anger burns against them!”\n\
      How long will they be incapable of innocence?\n"
    6: "⁶ For from Israel comes even this!\nA craftsman made it, so it is not God;\n\
      Assuredly, the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.\n"
    7: "⁷ For they sow wind\nAnd they harvest a storm.\nThe standing grain has no\
      \ kernels;\nIt yields no grain.\nIf it were to yield, strangers would swallow\
      \ it. \n"
    8: "⁸ Israel has been swallowed up;\nThey are now among the nations\nLike a vessel\
      \ in which no one delights.\n"
    9: "⁹ For they have gone up to Assyria,\nLike a wild donkey all alone;\nEphraim\
      \ has paid fees for lovers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Even though they pay for allies among the nations,\nI will gather them\
      \ up now;\nAnd they will begin to diminish\nBecause of the burden of the king\
      \ of officials. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin,\nThey have become altars\
      \ of sinning for him.\n"
    12: "¹² Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My Law,\nThey are regarded\
      \ as a strange thing.\n"
    13: "¹³ As for My sacrificial gifts,\nThey sacrifice the flesh and eat it,\nBut\
      \ the Lord has taken no delight in them.\nNow He will remember their guilt,\n\
      And punish them for their sins;\nThey will return to Egypt.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;\nAnd Judah has multiplied\
      \ fortified cities,\nBut I will send a fire on its cities, and it will consume\
      \ its palatial buildings."
  9:
    1: "¹ Do not rejoice, Israel, with jubilation like the nations!\nFor you have\
      \ been unfaithful, abandoning your God.\nYou have loved the earnings of unfaithfulness\
      \ on every threshing floor.\n"
    2: "² Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them,\nAnd the new wine will\
      \ fail them.\n"
    3: "³ They will not remain in the Lord’s land,\nBut Ephraim will return to Egypt,\n\
      And in Assyria they will eat unclean food.\n"
    4: "⁴ They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lord,\nNor will their\
      \ sacrifices please Him.\nTheir bread will be to them like mourners’ bread;\n\
      All who eat it will be defiled,\nBecause their bread will be for themselves\
      \ alone;\nIt will not enter the house of the Lord.\n"
    5: "⁵ What will you do on the day of the appointed festival\nAnd on the day of\
      \ the feast of the Lord?\n"
    6: "⁶ For behold, they will be gone because of destruction;\nEgypt will gather\
      \ them together, Memphis will bury them.\nWeeds will take possession of their\
      \ treasures of silver;\nThorns will be in their tents. \n"
    7: "⁷ The days of punishment have come,\nThe days of retribution have come;\n\
      Let Israel know this!\nThe prophet is a fool,\nThe inspired person is insane,\n\
      Because of the grossness of your wrongdoing,\nAnd because your hostility is\
      \ so great.\n"
    8: "⁸ Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet;\nYet the snare of a bird\
      \ catcher is in all his ways,\nAnd there is only hostility in the house of his\
      \ God.\n"
    9: "⁹ They are deeply depraved\nAs in the days of Gibeah;\nHe will remember their\
      \ guilt,\nHe will punish their sins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness;\nI saw your forefathers\
      \ as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season.\nBut they came\
      \ to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame,\nAnd they became as detestable\
      \ as that which they loved.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird—\nNo birth, no pregnancy,\
      \ and no conception!\n"
    12: "¹² Though they bring up their children,\nYet I will bereave them of their\
      \ children until not a person is left.\nYes, woe to them indeed when I depart\
      \ from them!\n"
    13: "¹³ Ephraim, as I have seen,\nIs planted in a pasture like Tyre;\nBut Ephraim\
      \ is going to bring out his children for slaughter.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Give to them, Lord—what will You give?\nGive them a miscarrying womb and\
      \ dried-up breasts. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All their evil is at Gilgal;\nIndeed, I came to hate them there!\nBecause\
      \ of the wickedness of their deeds\nI will drive them out of My house!\nI will\
      \ no longer love them;\nAll their leaders are rebels.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up,\nThey will produce no fruit.\n\
      Even though they give birth to children,\nI will put to death the precious ones\
      \ of their womb.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ My God will reject them\nBecause they have not listened to Him;\nAnd they\
      \ will be wanderers among the nations."
  10:
    1: "¹ Israel is a luxuriant vine;\nHe produces fruit for himself.\nThe more his\
      \ fruit,\nThe more altars he made;\nThe richer his land,\nThe better he made\
      \ the memorial stones.\n"
    2: "² Their heart is deceitful;\nNow they must suffer for their guilt.\nThe Lord\
      \ will break down their altars\nAnd destroy their memorial stones. \n"
    3: "³ Certainly now they will say, “We have no king,\nFor we do not revere the\
      \ Lord.\nAs for the king, what can he do for us?”\n"
    4: "⁴ They speak mere words,\nWith worthless oaths they make covenants;\nAnd judgment\
      \ sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.\n"
    5: "⁵ The inhabitants of Samaria will fear\nFor the calf of Beth-aven.\nIndeed,\
      \ its people will mourn for it,\nAnd its idolatrous priests will cry out over\
      \ it,\nOver its glory, since it has left it.\n"
    6: "⁶ The thing itself will be brought to Assyria\nAs a gift of tribute to King\
      \ Jareb;\nEphraim will be seized with shame,\nAnd Israel will be ashamed of\
      \ its own plan.\n"
    7: "⁷ Samaria will be destroyed with her king,\nLike a twig on the surface of\
      \ the water.\n"
    8: "⁸ Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed;\nThorns\
      \ and thistles will grow on their altars;\nThen they will say to the mountains,\n\
      “Cover us!” And to the hills, “Fall on us!”\n"
    9: "⁹ Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, Israel;\nThere they stand!\nWill\
      \ the battle against the sons of injustice not overtake them in Gibeah?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ When it is My desire, I will discipline them;\nAnd the peoples will be\
      \ gathered against them\nWhen they are bound for their double guilt. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh,\nAnd I passed over her\
      \ lovely neck;\nI will harness Ephraim,\nJudah will plow, Jacob will harrow\
      \ for himself.\n"
    12: "¹² Sow for yourselves, with a view to righteousness;\nHarvest in accordance\
      \ with kindness.\nBreak up your uncultivated ground,\nFor it is time to seek\
      \ the Lord\nUntil He comes and rains righteousness on you.\n"
    13: "¹³ You have plowed wickedness, you have harvested injustice,\nYou have eaten\
      \ the fruit of lies.\nBecause you have trusted in your way, in your many warriors,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ An uproar will arise among your people,\nAnd all your fortresses will\
      \ be destroyed,\nAs Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle,\nWhen\
      \ mothers were slaughtered with their children.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness.\n\
      At dawn the king of Israel will be completely destroyed."
  11:
    1: "¹ When Israel was a youth I loved him,\nAnd out of Egypt I called My son.\n"
    2: "² The more they called them,\nThe more they went away from them;\nThey kept\
      \ sacrificing to the Baals\nAnd burning incense to idols.\n"
    3: "³ Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk,\nI took them in My arms;\nBut they\
      \ did not know that I healed them.\n"
    4: "⁴ I pulled them along with cords of a man, with ropes of love,\nAnd I became\
      \ to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws;\nAnd I bent down and fed\
      \ them. \n"
    5: "⁵ They will not return to the land of Egypt;\nBut Assyria—he will be their\
      \ king\nBecause they refused to return to Me.\n"
    6: "⁶ And the sword will whirl against their cities,\nAnd will destroy their oracle\
      \ priests\nAnd consume them, because of their counsels.\n"
    7: "⁷ So My people are determined to turn from Me.\nThough they call them to the\
      \ One on high,\nNone at all exalts Him. \n"
    8: "⁸ How can I give you up, Ephraim?\nHow can I surrender you, Israel?\nHow can\
      \ I make you like Admah?\nHow can I treat you like Zeboiim?\nMy heart is turned\
      \ over within Me,\nAll My compassions are kindled.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will not carry out My fierce anger;\nI will not destroy Ephraim again.\n\
      For I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst,\nAnd I will not come\
      \ in wrath.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They will walk after the Lord,\nHe will roar like a lion;\nIndeed He will\
      \ roar,\nAnd His sons will come trembling from the west.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They will come trembling like birds from Egypt,\nAnd like doves from the\
      \ land of Assyria;\nAnd I will settle them in their houses, declares the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Ephraim surrounds Me with lies\nAnd the house of Israel with deceit;\n\
      Judah is still unruly against God,\nEven against the Holy One who is faithful."
  12:
    1: "¹ Ephraim feeds on wind,\nAnd pursues the east wind continually;\nHe multiplies\
      \ lies and violence.\nMoreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria,\nAnd oil is\
      \ brought to Egypt.\n"
    2: "² The Lord also has a case against Judah,\nAnd will punish Jacob according\
      \ to his ways;\nHe will repay him according to his deeds.\n"
    3: "³ In the womb he took his brother by the heel,\nAnd in his mature strength\
      \ he contended with God.\n"
    4: "⁴ Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed;\nHe wept and implored His\
      \ favor.\nHe found Him at Bethel,\nAnd there He spoke with us,\n"
    5: "⁵ And the Lord, the God of armies,\nThe Lord is His name.\n"
    6: "⁶ So as for you, return to your God,\nMaintain kindness and justice,\nAnd\
      \ wait for your God continually.\n"
    7: "⁷ A merchant, in whose hands are fraudulent balances,\nLoves to exploit.\n"
    8: "⁸ And Ephraim said, “I have certainly become rich,\nI have found wealth for\
      \ myself;\nIn all my labors they will find in me\nNo wrongdoing, which would\
      \ be sin.”\n"
    9: "⁹ But I have been the Lord your God since the land of Egypt;\nI will make\
      \ you live in tents again,\nAs in the days of the appointed festival.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I have also spoken to the prophets,\nAnd I provided many visions,\nAnd\
      \ through the prophets I spoke in parables.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Is there injustice in Gilead?\nCertainly they are worthless.\nIn Gilgal\
      \ they sacrifice bulls,\nYes, their altars are like stone heaps\nBeside the\
      \ furrows of a field. \n"
    12: "¹² Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram,\nAnd Israel worked for a wife,\nAnd\
      \ for a wife he kept sheep.\n"
    13: "¹³ But by a prophet the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt,\nAnd by a prophet\
      \ he was protected.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Ephraim has provoked God to bitter anger;\nSo his Lord will leave his\
      \ guilt for bloodshed on him\nAnd bring his disgrace back to him."
  13:
    1: "¹ When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.\nHe exalted himself in Israel,\n\
      But through Baal he incurred guilt and died.\n"
    2: "² And now they sin more and more,\nAnd make for themselves cast metal images,\n\
      Idols skillfully made from their silver,\nAll of them the work of craftsmen.\n\
      They say of them, “Let the people who sacrifice kiss the calves!”\n"
    3: "³ Therefore they will be like the morning cloud\nAnd like dew which soon disappears,\n\
      Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor,\nAnd like smoke from\
      \ a chimney. \n"
    4: "⁴ Yet I have been the Lord your God\nSince the land of Egypt;\nAnd you were\
      \ not to know any god except Me,\nFor there is no savior besides Me.\n"
    5: "⁵ I cared for you in the wilderness,\nIn the land of drought.\n"
    6: "⁶ As they had their pasture, they became satisfied,\nAnd as they became satisfied,\
      \ their heart became proud;\nTherefore they forgot Me.\n"
    7: "⁷ So I will be like a lion to them;\nLike a leopard I will lie in wait by\
      \ the wayside.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will confront them like a bear deprived of her cubs,\nAnd I will tear\
      \ open their chests;\nI will also devour them there like a lioness,\nAs a wild\
      \ animal would tear them to pieces. \n"
    9: "⁹ It is to your own destruction, Israel,\nThat you are against Me, against\
      \ your help.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Where then is your king,\nThat he might save you in all your cities;\n\
      And your judges, to whom you said,\n“Give me a king and princes”?\n"
    11: "¹¹ I gave you a king in My anger,\nAnd took him away in My wrath. \n"
    12: "¹² The guilt of Ephraim is wrapped up;\nHis sin is stored up.\n"
    13: "¹³ The pains of childbirth come on him;\nHe is not a wise son,\nFor it is\
      \ not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol?\nShall I redeem them from\
      \ death?\nDeath, where are your thorns?\nSheol, where is your sting?\nCompassion\
      \ will be hidden from My sight. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Though he flourishes among the reeds,\nAn east wind will come,\nThe wind\
      \ of the Lord coming up from the wilderness;\nAnd his fountain will become dry\n\
      And his spring will dry up;\nIt will plunder his treasury of every precious\
      \ article.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Samaria will pay the penalty for her guilt,\nBecause she has rebelled\
      \ against her God.\nThey will fall by the sword,\nTheir children will be slaughtered,\n\
      And their pregnant women will be ripped open."
  14:
    1: "¹ Return, Israel, to the Lord your God,\nFor you have stumbled because of\
      \ your wrongdoing.\n"
    2: "² Take words with you and return to the Lord.\nSay to Him, “Take away all\
      \ guilt\nAnd receive us graciously,\nSo that we may present the fruit of our\
      \ lips.\n"
    3: "³ Assyria will not save us,\nWe will not ride on horses;\nNor will we say\
      \ again, ‘Our god’\nTo the work of our hands;\nFor in You the orphan finds mercy.”\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ I will heal their apostasy,\nI will love them freely,\nBecause My anger\
      \ has turned away from them.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will be like the dew to Israel;\nHe will blossom like the lily,\nAnd he\
      \ will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.\n"
    6: "⁶ His shoots will sprout,\nHis majesty will be like the olive tree,\nAnd his\
      \ fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.\n"
    7: "⁷ Those who live in his shadow\nWill again raise grain,\nAnd they will blossom\
      \ like the vine.\nHis fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. \n"
    8: "⁸ Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols?\nIt is I who answer and look\
      \ after you.\nI am like a luxuriant juniper;\nFrom Me comes your fruit. \n"
    9: "⁹ Whoever is wise, let him understand these things;\nWhoever is discerning,\
      \ let him know them.\nFor the ways of the Lord are right,\nAnd the righteous\
      \ will walk in them,\nBut wrongdoers will stumble in them."
