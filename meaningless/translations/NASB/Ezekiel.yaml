Ezekiel:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth
      month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened
      and I saw visions of God. '
    2: '² (On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile, '
    3: "³ the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi,\
      \ in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the\
      \ Lord came upon him.) \n"
    4: '⁴ As I looked, behold, a high wind was coming from the north, a great cloud
      with fire flashing intermittently and a bright light around it, and in its midst
      something like gleaming metal in the midst of the fire. '
    5: '⁵ And within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this
      was their appearance: they had human form. '
    6: '⁶ Each of them had four faces and four wings. '
    7: '⁷ Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf’s hoof, and they
      sparkled like polished bronze. '
    8: '⁸ Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. As for the faces
      and wings of the four of them, '
    9: '⁹ their wings touched one another; their faces did not turn when they moved,
      each went straight forward. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for the form of their faces, each had a human face; all four had the
      face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four
      had the face of an eagle. '
    11: '¹¹ Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two
      touching another being, and two covering their bodies. '
    12: '¹² And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they
      would go, without turning as they went. '
    13: '¹³ In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like
      burning coals of fire, like torches moving among the living beings. The fire
      was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the living beings ran back and forth like bolts of lightning. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the
      ground beside the living beings, for each of the four of them. '
    16: '¹⁶ The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like sparkling
      topaz, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship
      being as if one wheel were within another. '
    17: '¹⁷ Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions without
      turning as they moved. '
    18: '¹⁸ As for their rims, they were high and awesome, and the rims of all four
      of them were covered with eyes all around. '
    19: '¹⁹ Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever
      the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also. '
    20: '²⁰ Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction.
      And the wheels rose just as they did; for the spirit of the living beings was
      in the wheels. '
    21: "²¹ Whenever those went, they went; and whenever those stopped, they stopped.\
      \ And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose just as they did;\
      \ for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. \n"
    22: '²² Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like an expanse,
      like the awesome gleam of crystal, spread out over their heads. '
    23: '²³ Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward
      the other; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and
      on the other. '
    24: '²⁴ And I also heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of abundant
      waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of a crowd like
      the sound of an army camp; whenever they stopped, they let down their wings. '
    25: "²⁵ And a voice came from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever\
      \ they stood still, they let down their wings. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling
      a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne,
      high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man. '
    27: '²⁷ Then I noticed from the appearance of His waist and upward something like
      gleaming metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance
      of His waist and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance
      around Him. '
    28: ²⁸ Like the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was
      the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness
      of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice
      speaking.
  2:
    1: '¹ Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with
      you.” '
    2: '² And as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I
      heard Him speaking to me. '
    3: '³ Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel,
      to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers
      have revolted against Me to this very day. '
    4: '⁴ So I am sending you to those who are impudent and obstinate children, and
      you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:’ '
    5: '⁵ As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they
      will know that a prophet has been among them. '
    6: '⁶ And as for you, son of man, you are not to fear them nor fear their words,
      though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; you are not
      to fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, since they are a rebellious
      house. '
    7: "⁷ But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they\
      \ are rebellious. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious
      like that rebellious house. Open your mouth wide and eat what I am giving you.” '
    9: '⁹ Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended to me; and behold, a scroll
      was in it. '
    10: ¹⁰ When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back,
      and written on it were songs of mourning, sighing, and woe.
  3:
    1: '¹ Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and
      go, speak to the house of Israel.” '
    2: '² So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll. '
    3: "³ And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with\
      \ this scroll which I am giving you.” Then I ate it, and it was as sweet as\
      \ honey in my mouth. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with
      My words to them. '
    5: '⁵ For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult
      language, but to the house of Israel, '
    6: '⁶ nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose
      words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to the people who understand
      you; '
    7: '⁷ yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they
      are not willing to listen to Me. The entire house of Israel certainly is stubborn
      and obstinate. '
    8: '⁸ Behold, I have made your face just as hard as their faces, and your forehead
      just as hard as their foreheads. '
    9: '⁹ Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid
      of them or be dismayed before them, since they are a rebellious house.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, take into your heart all My words
      which I will speak to you and listen closely. '
    11: "¹¹ Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell\
      \ them, whether they listen or not, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind
      me: “Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place!” '
    13: '¹³ And I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another
      and the sound of the wheels beside them, even a great rumbling sound. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in
      the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib,\
      \ and I sat there for seven days where they were living, causing consternation\
      \ among them. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel;
      whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me. '
    18: '¹⁸ When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn
      him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way so that he may live,
      that wicked person shall die for wrongdoing, but his blood I will require from
      your hand. '
    19: '¹⁹ However if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness
      or from his wicked way, he shall die for wrongdoing, but you have saved yourself. '
    20: '²⁰ Again, when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits
      sin, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned
      him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall
      not be remembered; but his blood I will require from your hand. '
    21: "²¹ However, if you have warned the righteous person that the righteous is\
      \ not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall certainly live because he took warning;\
      \ and you have saved yourself.” \n"
    22: '²² Now the hand of the Lord was on me there, and He said to me, “Get up,
      go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” '
    23: '²³ So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the Lord
      was standing there, like the glory that I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell
      on my face. '
    24: '²⁴ But the Spirit entered me and set me up on my feet; and He spoke with
      me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. '
    25: '²⁵ And as for you, son of man, they will put ropes around you and bind you
      with them so that you do not go out among them. '
    26: '²⁶ Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that
      you will be unable to speak and will not be a man who reprimands them, since
      they are a rebellious house. '
    27: ²⁷ But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them,
      ‘This is what the Lord God says:’ The one who hears, let him hear; and the one
      who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
  4:
    1: '¹ “Now you, son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you, and inscribe
      a city on it—Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, pile up an assault ramp,
      set up camps, and place battering rams against it all around. '
    3: "³ Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself\
      \ and the city, and direct your face toward it so that it is under siege, and\
      \ besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Then you are to lie down on your left side and put the wrongdoing of the
      house of Israel on it; you shall bear their wrongdoing for the number of days
      that you lie on it. '
    5: '⁵ For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their
      wrongdoing, 390 days; so you shall bear the wrongdoing of the house of Israel. '
    6: '⁶ When you have completed these days, you shall lie down a second time, but
      on your right side, and bear the wrongdoing of the house of Judah; I have assigned
      it to you for forty days, a day for each year. '
    7: '⁷ Then you shall direct your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your
      arm bared, and prophesy against it. '
    8: "⁸ Now behold, I will put ropes around you so that you cannot turn from your\
      \ one side to your other until you have completed the days of your siege. \n"
    9: '⁹ “But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt,
      and put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall
      eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, 390 days. '
    10: '¹⁰ Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall
      eat it from time to time. '
    11: '¹¹ The water you drink shall be a sixth of a hin by measure; you shall drink
      it from time to time. '
    12: '¹² You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked it in their sight over
      human dung.” '
    13: '¹³ Then the Lord said, “In this way the sons of Israel will eat their bread
      unclean among the nations where I will scatter them.” '
    14: '¹⁴ But I said, “Oh, Lord God! Behold, I have never been defiled; for from
      my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by animals,
      nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth!” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then He said to me, “See, I will give you cow’s dung in place of human
      dung, so that you may prepare your bread over it.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, behold, I am going to break the
      staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety,
      and drink water by measure and in horror, '
    17: ¹⁷ because bread and water will be scarce; and they will tremble with one
      another and waste away in their guilt.
  5:
    1: '¹ “As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it as a barber’s
      razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair. '
    2: '² A third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days
      of the siege are completed. Then you shall take a third and strike it with the
      sword all around the city, and a third you shall scatter to the wind; for I
      will unsheathe a sword behind them. '
    3: '³ Take also a few hairs in number from them and bind them in the hems of your
      robes. '
    4: "⁴ Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the\
      \ fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ “This is what the Lord God says: ‘This is Jerusalem; I have placed her at
      the center of the nations, with lands around her. '
    6: '⁶ But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations,
      and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have
      rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.’ '
    7: '⁷ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because you have more turmoil
      than the nations that surround you and have not walked in My statutes, nor executed
      My ordinances, nor acted in accordance with the ordinances of the nations around
      you,’ '
    8: '⁸ therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against
      you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. '
    9: '⁹ And because of all your abominations I will do among you what I have not
      done, and the like of which I will never do again. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore, fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat their
      fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to
      every wind. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore as I live,’ declares the Lord God, ‘Because you have defiled
      My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations,
      I definitely will also withdraw and My eye will have no pity, and I also will
      not spare. '
    12: "¹² A third of you will die by plague or perish by famine among you, a third\
      \ will fall by the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every wind,\
      \ and I will unsheathe a sword behind them. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Then My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and
      I will be appeased; then they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in My
      zeal, when I have spent My wrath upon them. '
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover, I will make you a site of ruins and a disgrace among the nations
      that surround you, in the sight of everyone who passes by. '
    15: '¹⁵ So it will be a disgrace, an object of abuse, a warning, and an object
      of horror to the nations that surround you when I execute judgments against
      you in anger, wrath, and raging reprimands. I, the Lord, have spoken. '
    16: '¹⁶ When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the
      destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will also intensify
      the famine upon you and break off your provision of bread. '
    17: ¹⁷ I will send on you famine and vicious animals, and they will bereave you
      of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring
      the sword on you. I, the Lord, have spoken.’”
  6:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy
      against them '
    3: '³ and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord God! This
      is what the Lord God says to the mountains, the hills, the ravines, and the
      valleys: “Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword against you, and I will
      destroy your high places. '
    4: '⁴ So your altars will become deserted and your incense altars will be smashed;
      and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols. '
    5: '⁵ I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their
      idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars. '
    6: '⁶ Everywhere you live, cities will be in ruins and the high places will be
      deserted, so that your altars will be in ruins and deserted, your idols will
      be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars will be cut down, and your
      works wiped out. '
    7: "⁷ The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    8: '⁸ “However, I will leave a remnant, in that you will have those who escaped
      the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries. '
    9: '⁹ Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which
      they will be taken captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts
      which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which committed infidelity with
      their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils
      which they have committed, for all their abominations. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then they will know that I am the Lord; I have not said in vain that I\
      \ would inflict this disaster on them.”’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “This is what the Lord God says: ‘Clap your hands, stamp your foot and
      say, “Woe, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which
      will fall by the sword, famine, and plague! '
    12: '¹² Anyone who is far away will die by the plague, anyone who is near will
      fall by the sword, and anyone who remains and is spared from these will die
      by the famine. So I will expend My wrath on them. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will know that I am the Lord, when their dead are among their
      idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains,
      under every leafy tree and under every massive oak with thick branches—the places
      where they offered a soothing aroma to all their idols. '
    14: ¹⁴ So through all their dwelling places I will stretch out My hand against
      them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah;
      so they will know that I am the Lord.”’”
  7:
    1: '¹ Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “And you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel:
      ‘An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land. '
    3: '³ Now the end is upon you, for I will send My anger against you; I will judge
      you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you. '
    4: "⁴ And My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare you, but I will bring\
      \ your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord!’ \n"
    5: '⁵ “This is what the Lord God says: ‘A disaster, a unique disaster, behold,
      it is coming! '
    6: '⁶ An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold,
      it has come! '
    7: '⁷ Your doom has come to you, you inhabitant of the land. The time has come,
      the day is near—panic rather than joyful shouting on the mountains. '
    8: '⁸ Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and expend My anger against
      you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations. '
    9: "⁹ My eye will have no pity nor will I spare you. I will repay you according\
      \ to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know\
      \ that I, the Lord, am striking. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Your doom has gone forth; the
      rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed. '
    11: '¹¹ Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain,
      none of their people, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them. '
    12: '¹² The time has come, the day has arrived. Let neither the buyer rejoice
      nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude. '
    13: "¹³ Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live;\
      \ for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will\
      \ any of them maintain his life by his wrongdoing. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is
      going to the battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sword is outside the city and the plague and the famine are within.
      Anyone who is in the field will die by the sword, while famine and the plague
      will consume those in the city. '
    16: '¹⁶ Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves
      of the valleys, all of them moaning, each over his own wrongdoing. '
    17: '¹⁷ All hands will hang limp, and all knees will drip with water. '
    18: '¹⁸ They will put on sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame
      will be on all faces, and a bald patch on all their heads. '
    19: "¹⁹ They will fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will become\
      \ an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to save them\
      \ on the day of the wrath of the Lord. They cannot satisfy their appetite, nor\
      \ can they fill their stomachs, because their wrongdoing has become a cause\
      \ of stumbling. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Moreover, they transformed the splendor of His jewels into pride, and
      they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things with
      it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them. '
    21: '²¹ And I will hand it over to the foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked
      of the earth as spoils; and they will profane it. '
    22: "²² I will also turn My face away from them, and they will profane My treasure;\
      \ then robbers will enter and profane it. \n"
    23: '²³ ‘Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is
      full of violence. '
    24: '²⁴ Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession
      of their houses. I will also put an end to the pride of the strong ones, and
      their holy places will be profaned. '
    25: '²⁵ When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. '
    26: '²⁶ Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be added to rumor; then
      they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the Law will be lost from the priest,
      and counsel from the elders. '
    27: ²⁷ The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed in horror, and the hands
      of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them because of their
      conduct, and by their judgments I will judge them. And they will know that I
      am the Lord.’”
  8:
    1: '¹ Now it came about in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month,
      as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that
      the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there. '
    2: '² Then I looked, and behold, something like the appearance of a man; from
      His waist and downward there was the appearance of fire, and from His waist
      and upward like the appearance of a glow, like gleaming metal. '
    3: '³ And He extended the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; and
      the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions
      of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner courtyard,
      where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was located. '
    4: "⁴ And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance\
      \ which I saw in the plain. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then He said to me, “Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north.”
      So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar
      gate was this idol of jealousy at the entrance. '
    6: "⁶ And He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great\
      \ abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would\
      \ be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations!”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Then He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and when I looked,
      behold, a hole in the wall. '
    8: '⁸ And He said to me, “Son of man, now dig through the wall.” So I dug through
      the wall, and behold, an entrance. '
    9: '⁹ Then He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are
      committing here.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of crawling things and
      animals and detestable things, with all the idols of the house of Israel, were
      carved on the wall all around. '
    11: '¹¹ And standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel,
      with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer
      in his hand; and the fragrance of the cloud of incense was rising. '
    12: '¹² Then He said to me, “Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house
      of Israel are doing in the dark, each man in the rooms of his carved images?
      For they say, ‘The Lord does not see us; the Lord has abandoned the land.’” '
    13: "¹³ And He said to me, “Yet you will see still greater abominations which\
      \ they are committing!” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord’s house which
      was toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. '
    15: "¹⁵ And He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still\
      \ greater abominations than these!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then He brought me into the inner courtyard of the Lord’s house. And behold,
      at the entrance to the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar,
      were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord while
      their faces were toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward
      toward the sun. '
    17: '¹⁷ And He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it a trivial thing
      for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed
      here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me to anger
      repeatedly? Yet behold, they are putting the twig to their nose! '
    18: ¹⁸ Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor will
      I spare; and though they cry out in My ears with a loud voice, yet I will not
      listen to them.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Then He cried out in my presence with a loud voice, saying, “Come forward,
      you executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand.” '
    2: "² And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces\
      \ north, each with his smashing weapon in his hand; and among them was one man\
      \ clothed in linen with a scribe’s kit at his waist. And they came in and stood\
      \ beside the bronze altar. \n"
    3: '³ Then the glory of the God of Israel ascended from the cherub on which it
      had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in
      linen at whose waist was the scribe’s kit. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the
      midst of Jerusalem, and make a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan
      and sigh over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst.” '
    5: '⁵ But to the others He said in my presence, “Go through the city after him
      and strike; do not let your eye have pity and do not spare. '
    6: '⁶ Utterly kill old men, young men, female virgins, little children, and women,
      but do not touch any person on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My
      sanctuary.” So they started with the elders who were before the temple. '
    7: '⁷ He also said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courtyards with the
      dead. Go out!” So they went out and struck and killed the people in the city. '
    8: "⁸ And as they were striking the people and I alone was left, I fell on my\
      \ face and cried out, saying, “Oh, Lord God! Are You going to destroy the entire\
      \ remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then He said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is very,
      very great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversion;
      for they say, ‘The Lord has abandoned the land, and the Lord does not see!’ '
    10: "¹⁰ But as for Me, My eye will have no pity nor will I spare, but I will bring\
      \ their conduct upon their heads.” \n"
    11: ¹¹ Then behold, the man clothed in linen, at whose waist was the scribe’s
      kit, reported, saying, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”
  10:
    1: '¹ Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the
      cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne,
      appeared above them. '
    2: "² And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Enter between the whirling\
      \ wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between\
      \ the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he entered in my sight.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the
      man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. '
    4: '⁴ Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub to the threshold of the
      temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled
      with the brightness of the glory of the Lord. '
    5: "⁵ Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the\
      \ outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks. \n"
    6: '⁶ And it came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take
      fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he entered
      and stood beside a wheel. '
    7: '⁷ Then the cherub reached out with his hand from between the cherubim to the
      fire which was between the cherubim, took some coals and put them into the hands
      of the one clothed in linen; and he took them and went out. '
    8: "⁸ The cherubim appeared to have something like a human hand under their wings.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside
      each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a Tarshish
      stone. '
    10: '¹⁰ And as for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as
      if one wheel were within another wheel. '
    11: '¹¹ When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning
      as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning
      as they went. '
    12: '¹² And their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels
      were covered with eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them. '
    13: '¹³ The wheels were called, as I heard, the whirling wheels. '
    14: "¹⁴ And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub,\
      \ the second face was the face of a human, the third, the face of a lion, and\
      \ the fourth, the face of an eagle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the
      river Chebar. '
    16: '¹⁶ Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would move beside them; also when
      the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels themselves
      would not turn away from beside them. '
    17: "¹⁷ When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when\
      \ they rose up, the wheels would rise with them, because the spirit of the living\
      \ beings was in them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and
      stood over the cherubim. '
    19: "¹⁹ When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the\
      \ ground in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the\
      \ entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of\
      \ Israel hovered over them. \n"
    20: '²⁰ These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the
      river Chebar; so I knew that they were cherubim. '
    21: '²¹ Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings
      was the form of human hands. '
    22: ²² As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance
      I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead.
  11:
    1: '¹ Now the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Lord’s
      house which faced eastward. And behold, there were twenty-five men at the entrance
      of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of
      Benaiah, leaders of the people. '
    2: '² Then He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise wrongdoing
      and give evil advice in this city, '
    3: '³ who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This city is the pot and
      we are the meat.’ '
    4: "⁴ Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man!” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and He said to me, “Say, ‘This
      is what the Lord says: “This is how you think, house of Israel, for I know your
      thoughts. '
    6: '⁶ You have multiplied your slain in this city, and filled its streets with
      them.” '
    7: '⁷ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Your slain whom you have laid
      in the midst of the city are the meat and this city is the pot; but I will bring
      you out of it. '
    8: '⁸ You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you,” the Lord God
      declares. '
    9: '⁹ “And I will bring you out of the midst of the city, and hand you over to
      strangers, and execute judgments against you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You will fall by the sword. I will judge you to the border of Israel;
      so you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be meat in the midst
      of it; I will judge you to the border of Israel. '
    12: "¹² So you will know that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes,\
      \ nor have you executed My ordinances, but you have acted in accordance with\
      \ the ordinances of the nations around you.”’” \n"
    13: "¹³ Now it came about, as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died.\
      \ Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice, and said, “Oh, Lord\
      \ God! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete destruction?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    15: '¹⁵ “Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the
      entire house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem
      have said, ‘Keep far from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Though I had removed
      them far away among the nations, and though I had scattered them among the countries,
      yet I was a sanctuary for them for a little while in the countries where they
      had gone.”’ '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “I will gather you from
      the peoples and assemble you from the countries among which you have been scattered,
      and I will give you the land of Israel.”’ '
    18: '¹⁸ When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all
      its abominations from it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And
      I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, '
    20: '²⁰ so that they may walk in My statutes, and keep My ordinances and do them.
      Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God. '
    21: "²¹ But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations,\
      \ I will bring their conduct down on their heads,” declares the Lord God. \n"
    22: '²² Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and
      the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them. '
    23: '²³ The glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood over
      the mountain which is east of the city. '
    24: '²⁴ And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of
      God to Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen left me. '
    25: ²⁵ And I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me.
  12:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes
      to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious
      house. '
    3: '³ So as for you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go
      into exile by day in their sight; that is, go into exile from your place to
      another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are
      a rebellious house. '
    4: '⁴ Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then
      you shall go out at evening in their sight, as those who are going into exile. '
    5: '⁵ Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it. '
    6: "⁶ Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the\
      \ dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have\
      \ set you as a sign to the house of Israel.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Then I did so, just as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage\
      \ like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with\
      \ my hands; I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in\
      \ their sight. \n"
    8: '⁸ And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Son of man, has the house of Israel, the rebellious house, not said to
      you, ‘What are you doing?’ '
    10: '¹⁰ Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “This pronouncement concerns
      the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it.”’ '
    11: '¹¹ Say, ‘I am a sign to you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them;
      they will go into exile, into captivity.’ '
    12: '¹² The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in
      the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out through
      it. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes. '
    13: '¹³ I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My net. And
      I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see
      it, though he will die there. '
    14: '¹⁴ And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and
      all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them. '
    15: '¹⁵ So they will know that I am the Lord, when I disperse them among the nations
      and scatter them among the countries. '
    16: "¹⁶ But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine, and plague\
      \ so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations where they\
      \ go, and may know that I am the Lord.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with
      quivering and anxiety. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Lord God says concerning
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread
      with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped
      of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it. '
    20: "²⁰ The inhabited cities will be in ruins, and the land will be a desolation.\
      \ So you will know that I am the Lord.”’” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    22: '²² “Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel,
      saying, ‘The days are long, and every vision fails’? '
    23: '²³ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “I will put an
      end to this proverb so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel.”
      But tell them, “The days are approaching as well as the fulfillment of every
      vision. '
    24: '²⁴ For there will no longer be any false vision or deceptive divination within
      the house of Israel. '
    25: "²⁵ For I the Lord will speak whatever word I speak, and it will be performed.\
      \ It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, you rebellious house, I will\
      \ speak the word and perform it,” declares the Lord God.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Furthermore, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he
      sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’ '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “None of My words
      will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,”’” declares
      the Lord God.'
  13:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say
      to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, ‘Listen to the word of the
      Lord! '
    3: '³ This is what the Lord God says: “Woe to the foolish prophets who are following
      their own spirit and have seen nothing! '
    4: '⁴ Israel, your prophets have been like jackals among ruins. '
    5: '⁵ You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build up a stone wall
      around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ They see deceit and lying divination, those who are saying, ‘The Lord declares,’
      when the Lord has not sent them; yet they wait for the fulfillment of their
      word! '
    7: "⁷ Did you not see a false vision and tell a lying divination when you said,\
      \ ‘The Lord declares,’ but it is not I who have spoken?”’” \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Because you have spoken deceit
      and have seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord
      God. '
    9: '⁹ “So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter
      lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor
      will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they
      enter the land of Israel, so that you may know that I am the Lord God. '
    10: '¹⁰ It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, ‘Peace!’
      when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster
      it over with whitewash; '
    11: '¹¹ so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A
      flooding rain will come, and you, hailstones, will fall, and a violent wind
      will break out. '
    12: '¹² Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, ‘Where is the
      plaster with which you plastered it?’” '
    13: '¹³ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “I will make a violent wind
      break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones
      to consume it in wrath. '
    14: '¹⁴ So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and
      hurl it down to the ground, so that its foundation is exposed; and when it falls,
      you will perish in its midst. And you will know that I am the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I will expend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered
      it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, ‘The wall is gone and those who
      plastered it are gone, '
    16: "¹⁶ along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see\
      \ a vision of peace for her when there is no peace,’ declares the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people
      who are talking like prophets from their own imagination. Prophesy against them '
    18: '¹⁸ and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Woe to the women who sew magic
      bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature
      to capture souls! Will you capture the souls of My people, but keep the souls
      of others alive for yourselves? '
    19: "¹⁹ For handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, you have profaned Me to My\
      \ people, to put to death some who should not die, and to keep others alive\
      \ who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.”’” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am against your
      magic bands by which you capture souls there as birds, and I will tear them
      from your arms; and I will let them go, those souls whom you capture as birds. '
    21: '²¹ I will also tear off your veils and save My people from your hands, and
      they will no longer be in your hands as prey; and you will know that I am the
      Lord. '
    22: '²² Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause
      him pain, but you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way
      to keep him alive, '
    23: ²³ therefore you women will no longer see deceitful visions or practice divination,
      and I will save My people from your hands. So you will know that I am the Lord.”
  14:
    1: '¹ Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me. '
    2: '² And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    3: '³ “Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have
      put in front of their faces the stumbling block of their wrongdoing. Should
      I let Myself be consulted by them at all? '
    4: '⁴ Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:
      “Anyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts in front
      of his face the stumbling block of his wrongdoing, and then comes to the prophet,
      I the Lord will let Myself answer him in the matter in view of the multitude
      of his idols, '
    5: "⁵ in order to take hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who have turned\
      \ away from Me due to all their idols.”’ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says:
      “Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your
      abominations. '
    7: '⁷ For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who reside in Israel,
      who deserts Me, sets up his idols in his heart, puts in front of his face the
      stumbling block of his wrongdoing, and then comes to the prophet to request
      something of Me for himself, I the Lord will let Myself answer him Myself. '
    8: "⁸ I will set My face against that person and make him a sign and a proverb,\
      \ and I will eliminate him from among My people. So you will know that I am\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “But if the prophet is persuaded so that he speaks a word, it is I, the
      Lord, who have persuaded that prophet; and I will stretch out My hand against
      him and eliminate him from among My people Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they will bear the punishment for their wrongdoing; as the wrongdoing
      of the inquirer is, so the wrongdoing of the prophet will be, '
    11: "¹¹ in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer\
      \ defile themselves with all their offenses. So they will be My people, and\
      \ I shall be their God,”’ declares the Lord God.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Son of man, if a country sins against Me by being unfaithful, and I stretch
      out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it,
      and eliminate from it both human and animal life, '
    14: '¹⁴ even though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst,
      by their own righteousness they could only save themselves,” declares the Lord
      God. '
    15: '¹⁵ “If I were to cause vicious animals to pass through the land and they
      depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it
      because of the animals, '
    16: '¹⁶ though these three men were in its midst, as I live,” declares the Lord
      God, “they could not save either their sons or their daughters. They alone would
      be saved, but the country would be desolate. '
    17: '¹⁷ Or if I were to bring a sword on that country and say, ‘A sword is to
      pass through the country,’ and I eliminated human and animal life from it, '
    18: '¹⁸ even though these three men were in its midst, as I live,” declares the
      Lord God, “they could not save either their sons or their daughters, but they
      alone would be saved. '
    19: '¹⁹ Or if I were to send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath
      on it in blood to eliminate man and animal from it, '
    20: "²⁰ even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst, as I live,” declares\
      \ the Lord God, “they could not save either their son or their daughter. They\
      \ would save only themselves by their righteousness.” \n"
    21: '²¹ For this is what the Lord God says: “How much more when I send My four
      severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, vicious animals, and plague
      to eliminate human and animal life from it! '
    22: '²² Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, both
      sons and daughters. Behold, they are going to come out to you, and you will
      see their conduct and actions; then you will be comforted for the disaster which
      I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it. '
    23: ²³ Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for
      you will know that I have not done without reason whatever I did to it,” declares
      the Lord God.
  15:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch
      which is among the trees of the forest? '
    3: '³ Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can even a peg be taken from
      it on which to hang any utensil? '
    4: '⁴ If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both
      of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it then good for anything? '
    5: '⁵ Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less,
      when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything! '
    6: '⁶ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘As the wood of the vine among
      the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I
      given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; '
    7: '⁷ and I set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet
      the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I set
      My face against them. '
    8: ⁸ So I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’”
      declares the Lord God.
  16:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and
      your birth are from the land of the Canaanite; your father was an Amorite and
      your mother a Hittite. '
    4: '⁴ As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut,
      nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt
      or even wrapped in cloths. '
    5: "⁵ No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have\
      \ compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you\
      \ were abhorred on the day you were born. \n"
    6: '⁶ “When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you
      while you were in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you while you were in your
      blood, ‘Live!’ '
    7: "⁷ I made you very numerous, like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became\
      \ tall and reached the age for fine jewelry; your breasts were formed and your\
      \ hair had grown. Yet you were naked and bare. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for
      love; so I spread My garment over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore
      an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine,”
      declares the Lord God. '
    9: '⁹ “Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you, and anointed
      you with oil. '
    10: '¹⁰ I also clothed you with colorfully woven cloth and put sandals of fine
      leather on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with
      silk. '
    11: '¹¹ I adorned you with jewelry, put bracelets on your wrists, and a necklace
      around your neck. '
    12: '¹² I also put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful
      crown on your head. '
    13: '¹³ So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen,
      silk, and colorfully woven cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil; so you
      were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, for\
      \ it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you,” declares the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But you trusted in your beauty and became unfaithful because of your
      fame, and you poured out your obscene practices on every passer-by to whom it
      might be tempting. '
    16: '¹⁶ You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various
      colors, and committed prostitution on them, which should not come about nor
      happen. '
    17: '¹⁷ You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver,
      which I had given you, and made for yourself male images so that you might commit
      prostitution with them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then you took your colorfully woven cloth and covered them, and offered
      My oil and My incense before them. '
    19: '¹⁹ Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey with which
      I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened,”
      declares the Lord God. '
    20: '²⁰ “Furthermore, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me
      and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your obscene practices a trivial
      matter? '
    21: '²¹ You slaughtered My children and offered them to idols by making them pass
      through the fire. '
    22: "²² And besides all your abominations and obscene practices, you did not remember\
      \ the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your\
      \ blood. \n"
    23: '²³ “Then it came about after all your wickedness (‘Woe, woe to you!’ declares
      the Lord God), '
    24: '²⁴ that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every
      public square. '
    25: '²⁵ You built yourself a high place at the beginning of every street and made
      your beauty abominable, and you spread your legs to every passer-by and multiplied
      your obscene practice. '
    26: '²⁶ You also committed prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors,
      and multiplied your obscene practice to provoke Me to anger. '
    27: '²⁷ So behold, I have stretched out My hand against you and cut back your
      rations. And I turned you over to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters
      of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your outrageous conduct. '
    28: '²⁸ Moreover, you committed prostitution with the Assyrians because you were
      not satisfied; you committed prostitution with them and still were not satisfied. '
    29: "²⁹ You also multiplied your obscene practice with the land of merchants,\
      \ Chaldea; yet even with this you were not satisfied.”’” \n"
    30: '³⁰ “How feverish is your heart,” declares the Lord God, “while you do all
      these things, the action of a bold prostitute! '
    31: '³¹ When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your
      high place in every public square, in spurning a prostitute’s fee, you were
      not like a prostitute. '
    32: '³² You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband! '
    33: '³³ Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your
      lovers and lavish favors on them so that they will come to you from every direction
      for your obscene practices. '
    34: "³⁴ So it is the opposite for you from those women in your obscene practices,\
      \ in that you are not approached for prostitution, and in the fact that you\
      \ pay a prostitute’s fee, and no fee is paid to you; so you are the opposite.”\
      \ \n"
    35: '³⁵ Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the Lord. '
    36: '³⁶ This is what the Lord God says: “Because your lewdness was poured out
      and your nakedness uncovered through your obscene practices with your lovers
      and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons that
      you gave to idols, '
    37: '³⁷ therefore, behold, I am going to gather all your lovers whom you pleased,
      all those whom you loved as well as all those whom you hated. So I will gather
      them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them so that
      they may see all your nakedness. '
    38: '³⁸ So I will judge you as women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged;
      and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. '
    39: '³⁹ I will also hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your
      shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your
      jewels, and will leave you naked and bare. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They will incite a crowd against you, and they will stone you and cut
      you to pieces with their swords. '
    41: '⁴¹ And they will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments against
      you in the sight of many women. Then I will put an end to your prostitution,
      and you will also no longer pay your lovers. '
    42: '⁴² So I will satisfy My fury against you and My jealousy will leave you,
      and I will be pacified and no longer be angry. '
    43: "⁴³ Since you have not remembered the days of your youth but have caused Me\
      \ unrest by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down\
      \ on your own head,” declares the Lord God, “so that you will not commit this\
      \ outrageous sin in addition to all your other abominations. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you,
      saying, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ '
    45: '⁴⁵ You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children.
      You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children.
      Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters;
      and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Yet you have not merely walked in their ways and committed their abominations;
      but, as if that were too little, you also acted more corruptly in all your conduct
      than they. '
    48: '⁴⁸ As I live,” declares the Lord God, “Sodom, your sister and her daughters
      have not done as you and your daughters have done! '
    49: '⁴⁹ Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters
      had arrogance, plenty of food, and carefree ease, but she did not help the poor
      and needy. '
    50: '⁵⁰ So they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I
      removed them when I saw it. '
    51: '⁵¹ Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied
      your abominations more than they. So you have made your sisters appear innocent
      by all your abominations which you have committed. '
    52: "⁵² Also, bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for\
      \ your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than\
      \ they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your\
      \ disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear innocent. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “Nevertheless, I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and
      her daughters, the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them
      your own fortunes, '
    54: '⁵⁴ so that you will bear your disgrace and feel ashamed for all that you
      have done when you become a consolation to them. '
    55: '⁵⁵ Your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters,
      will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will also return
      to your former state. '
    56: '⁵⁶ As the name of your sister Sodom was not heard from your lips in your
      day of pride, '
    57: '⁵⁷ before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the disgrace
      of the daughters of Edom and of all who are around her, of the daughters of
      the Philistines—those surrounding you who despise you. '
    58: '⁵⁸ You have suffered the penalty of your outrageous sin and abominations,”
      the Lord declares. '
    59: "⁵⁹ For this is what the Lord God says: “I will also do with you as you have\
      \ done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant. \n"
    60: '⁶⁰ “Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your
      youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. '
    61: '⁶¹ Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your
      sisters, both your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters,
      but not because of your covenant. '
    62: '⁶² So I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am
      the Lord, '
    63: ⁶³ so that you may remember and be ashamed, and not open your mouth again
      because of your disgrace, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done,”
      the Lord God declares.
  17:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, ask a riddle and present a parable to the house of Israel, '
    3: '³ saying, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “A great eagle with great wings,
      long pinions, and a full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took away
      the top of the cedar. '
    4: '⁴ He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of
      merchants; he set it in a city of traders. '
    5: '⁵ He also took from the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil, a
      meadow beside abundant waters; he set it like a willow. '
    6: "⁶ Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned\
      \ toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced\
      \ shoots and sent out branches. \n"
    7: '⁷ “But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and
      behold, this vine turned its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward
      him from the beds where it was planted, so that he might water it. '
    8: '⁸ It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, so that it would produce
      branches and bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.”’ '
    9: '⁹ Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Will it thrive? Will he not pull
      up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers—so that all its sprouting
      shoots wither? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised
      from its roots again. '
    10: "¹⁰ Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither\
      \ as soon as the east wind strikes it—wither on the beds where it grew?”’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’
      Say, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and leaders,
      and brought them to him in Babylon. '
    13: '¹³ Then he took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting
      him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, '
    14: '¹⁴ so that the kingdom would be humbled, not exalting itself, but keeping
      his covenant so that it might continue. '
    15: '¹⁵ But he revolted against him by sending his messengers to Egypt so that
      they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does
      these things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape? '
    16: '¹⁶ As I live,’ declares the Lord God, ‘In the country of the king who put
      him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, in Babylon
      he shall certainly die. '
    17: '¹⁷ Pharaoh with his mighty army and great contingent will not help him in
      the war, when they pile up assault ramps and build siege walls to eliminate
      many lives. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged
      his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.’” '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “As I live, My oath which he
      despised and My covenant which he broke, I will certainly inflict on his head. '
    20: '²⁰ And I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My net. Then
      I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there regarding
      the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me. '
    21: "²¹ All the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors\
      \ will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the Lord, have\
      \ spoken.” \n"
    22: '²² This is what the Lord God says: “I will also take a sprig from the lofty
      top of the cedar and set it out; I will break off from the topmost of its young
      twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. '
    23: '²³ On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, so that it may bring forth
      branches and bear fruit, and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind
      will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches. '
    24: ²⁴ All the trees of the field will know that I am the Lord; I bring down the
      high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree
      flourish. I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will perform it.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “What do you people mean by using this proverb about the land of Israel,\
      \ saying,\n‘The fathers eat sour grapes,\nBut it is the children’s teeth that\
      \ have become blunt’? \n"
    3: '³ As I live,” declares the Lord God, “you certainly are not going to use this
      proverb in Israel anymore. '
    4: "⁴ Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of\
      \ the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die. \n"
    5: '⁵ “But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness, '
    6: '⁶ if he does not eat at the mountain shrines or raise his eyes to the idols
      of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during
      her menstrual period— '
    7: '⁷ and if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge,
      does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked
      with clothing, '
    8: '⁸ and if he does not lend money at interest or take interest, if he keeps
      his hand from injustice and executes true justice between one person and another, '
    9: "⁹ if he walks in My statutes and keeps My ordinances so as to deal faithfully—he\
      \ is righteous and will certainly live,” declares the Lord God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “However, he may father a violent son who sheds blood, and does any one
      of these things to a brother '
    11: '¹¹ (though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats
      at the mountain shrines, and defiles his neighbor’s wife, '
    12: '¹² oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge,
      but raises his eyes to the idols and commits abomination, '
    13: "¹³ lends money at interest and takes interest; will he live? He will not\
      \ live! He has committed all these abominations, he shall certainly be put to\
      \ death; his blood will be on himself. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Now behold, he has fathered a son who saw all his father’s sins which
      he committed, but he has seen them and does not do likewise. '
    15: '¹⁵ He does not eat at the mountain shrines or raise his eyes to the idols
      of the house of Israel; he has not defiled his neighbor’s wife, '
    16: '¹⁶ nor oppressed anyone, nor retained a pledge, nor committed robbery; instead,
      he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, '
    17: '¹⁷ he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take any kind of interest on
      loans, but executes My ordinances, and walks in My statutes; he will not die
      for his father’s guilt, he will certainly live. '
    18: "¹⁸ As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother,\
      \ and did what was not good among his people, behold, he will die for his guilt.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not suffer the punishment for the father’s
      guilt?’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has kept all
      My statutes and done them, he shall certainly live. '
    20: "²⁰ The person who sins will die. A son will not suffer the punishment for\
      \ the father’s guilt, nor will a father suffer the punishment for the son’s\
      \ guilt; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness\
      \ of the wicked will be upon himself. \n"
    21: '²¹ “But if the wicked person turns from all his sins which he has committed
      and keeps all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall
      certainly live; he shall not die. '
    22: '²² All his offenses which he has committed will not be remembered against
      him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live. '
    23: "²³ Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord\
      \ God, “rather than that he would turn from his ways and live? \n"
    24: '²⁴ “But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness, commits
      injustice and does according to all the abominations that the wicked person
      does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered
      for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed;
      for them he will die. '
    25: '²⁵ Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Hear now, house of Israel!
      Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right? '
    26: '²⁶ When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness, commits injustice
      and dies because of it, for his injustice which he has committed he dies. '
    27: '²⁷ But when a wicked person turns away from his wickedness which he has committed
      and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life. '
    28: '²⁸ Since he understood and turned away from all his offenses which he had
      committed, he shall certainly live; he shall not die. '
    29: "²⁹ But the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Are\

    30: '³⁰ “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each according to his conduct,”

      yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why should you die, house of Israel? '
    32: ³² For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” declares the Lord

    1: '¹ “As for you, take up a song of mourning for the leaders of Israel '
    2: "² and say,\n‘What was your mother?\nA lioness among lions!\nShe lay down among\
      \ young lions,\nShe raised her cubs.\n"
    3: "³ When she brought up one of her cubs,\nHe became a young lion,\nAnd he learned\
      \ to tear his prey;\nHe devoured people.\n"
    4: "⁴ Then nations heard about him;\nHe was caught in their trap,\nAnd they brought\
      \ him with hooks\nTo the land of Egypt.\n"
    5: "⁵ When she saw, as she waited,\nThat her hope was lost,\nShe took another\
      \ of her cubs\nAnd made him a young lion.\n"
    6: "⁶ And he walked about among the lions,\nHe became a young lion;\nHe learned\
      \ to tear his prey;\nHe devoured people.\n"
    7: "⁷ He destroyed their palaces\nAnd laid waste their cities;\nAnd the land and\
      \ its fullness were appalled\nBecause of the sound of his roaring.\n"
    8: "⁸ Then nations set against him\nOn every side from their provinces,\nAnd they\
      \ spread their net over him;\nHe was caught in their trap.\n"
    9: "⁹ They put him in a wooden collar with hooks\nAnd brought him to the king\
      \ of Babylon;\nThey brought him in hunting nets\nSo that his voice would no\
      \ longer be heard\nOn the mountains of Israel.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,\nPlanted by the waters;\n\
      It was fruitful and thick with branches\nBecause of abundant waters.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And it had strong stems fit for scepters of rulers,\nAnd its height was\
      \ raised above the clouds\nSo that it was seen in its height with the mass of\
      \ its branches.\n"
    12: "¹² But it was uprooted in fury;\nIt was thrown down to the ground;\nAnd the\
      \ east wind dried up its fruit.\nIts strong stem was torn out\nSo that it withered;\n\
      The fire consumed it.\n"
    13: "¹³ And now it is planted in the wilderness,\nIn a dry and thirsty land.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And fire has gone out from its stem;\nIt has consumed its shoots and fruit,\n\
      So that there is no strong stem in it,\nA scepter to rule.’”\nThis is a song\
      \ of mourning, and has become a song of mourning."
  20:
    1: '¹ Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month,
      men from the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before
      me. '
    2: '² Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    3: '³ “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what
      the Lord God says: “Do you yourselves come to inquire of Me? As I live,” declares
      the Lord God, “I certainly will not be inquired of by you.”’ '
    4: '⁴ Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make known to them
      the abominations of their fathers; '
    5: '⁵ and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “On the day when I chose
      Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known
      to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am the Lord your
      God, '
    6: '⁶ on that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into
      a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the
      glory of all the lands. '
    7: '⁷ And I said to them, ‘Throw away, each of you, the detestable things of his
      eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your
      God.’ '
    8: "⁸ But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they\
      \ did not throw away, each of them, the detestable things of their eyes, nor\
      \ did they abandon the idols of Egypt.\n“Then I resolved to pour out My wrath\
      \ on them, to use up My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. "
    9: '⁹ But I acted for the sake of My name, that it would not be defiled in the
      sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known
      to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt. '
    10: '¹⁰ So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. '
    11: '¹¹ I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, which, if
      a person follows them, then he will live by them. '
    12: '¹² Also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, so that
      they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them. '
    13: '¹³ But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did
      not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances, which, if a person
      follows them, then he will live by them; and they greatly profaned My Sabbaths.
      Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate
      them. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be defiled before
      the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them out. '
    15: '¹⁵ Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into
      the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory
      of all the lands, '
    16: '¹⁶ because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did
      not walk in them; they also profaned My Sabbaths, because their heart continually
      followed their idols. '
    17: "¹⁷ Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not bring\
      \ about their annihilation in the wilderness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Instead, I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in
      the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with
      their idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and
      follow them. '
    20: '²⁰ Sanctify My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, so
      that you may know that I am the Lord your God.’ '
    21: '²¹ But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes,
      nor were they careful to follow My ordinances which, if a person follows them,
      then he will live by them; they profaned My Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour
      out My wrath on them, to use up My anger against them in the wilderness. '
    22: '²² But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, so that it would
      not be defiled in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them
      out. '
    23: '²³ Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among
      the nations and disperse them among the lands, '
    24: '²⁴ because they had not complied with My ordinances, but had rejected My
      statutes and had profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their
      fathers. '
    25: '²⁵ I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances by which
      they could not live; '
    26: "²⁶ and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they made\
      \ all their firstborn pass through the fire so that I might make them desolate,\
      \ in order that they might know that I am the Lord.”’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them,
      ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Again, in this your fathers have blasphemed
      Me by being disloyal to Me. '
    28: '²⁸ When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then
      they saw every high hill and every tree thick with branches, and there they
      offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering.
      There also they made their soothing aroma and there they poured out their drink
      offerings. '
    29: '²⁹ Then I said to them, ‘What is the high place to which you go?’ So its
      name is called Bamah to this day.”’ '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says:
      “Will you defile yourselves in the way of your fathers and adulterously pursue
      their detestable things? '
    31: '³¹ And when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the
      fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. So shall
      I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live,” declares the Lord God,
      “I certainly will not be inquired of by you. '
    32: "³² And whatever comes into your mind certainly will not come about, when\
      \ you say: ‘We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, serving\
      \ wood and stone.’ \n"
    33: '³³ “As I live,” declares the Lord God, “with a mighty hand and with an outstretched
      arm and with wrath poured out, I assuredly shall be king over you. '
    34: '³⁴ I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where
      you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with
      wrath poured out; '
    35: '³⁵ and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will
      enter into judgment with you face to face. '
    36: '³⁶ Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of
      the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,” declares the Lord
      God. '
    37: '³⁷ “I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond
      of the covenant; '
    38: "³⁸ and I will purge from you the rebels and those who revolt against Me;\
      \ I will bring them out of the land where they reside, but they will not enter\
      \ the land of Israel. So you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “As for you, house of Israel,” this is what the Lord God says: “Go, serve,
      everyone of you his idols; but later you will certainly listen to Me, and My
      holy name you will no longer defile with your gifts and your idols. '
    40: '⁴⁰ For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel,” declares the
      Lord God, “there the entire house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the
      land; there I will accept them and there I will demand your contributions and
      the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things. '
    41: '⁴¹ As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples
      and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I will show Myself
      to be holy among you in the sight of the nations. '
    42: '⁴² And you will know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of
      Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers. '
    43: '⁴³ And there you will remember your ways and all your deeds by which you
      have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for
      all the evil things that you have done. '
    44: "⁴⁴ Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have dealt with you in behalf\
      \ of My name, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds,\
      \ house of Israel,” declares the Lord God.’” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    46: '⁴⁶ “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and speak prophetically against
      the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev, '
    47: '⁴⁷ and say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of the Lord: this is
      what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am going to kindle a fire in you, and it
      will consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing
      flame will not go out and the entire surface from south to north will be scorched
      by it. '
    48: '⁴⁸ And all mankind will see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it will not
      go out.”’” '
    49: ⁴⁹ Then I said, “Oh, Lord God! They are saying of me, ‘Is he not just speaking
      in riddles?’”
  21:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem, and speak prophetically against
      the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel; '
    3: '³ and say to the land of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am
      against you; and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you the
      righteous and the wicked. '
    4: '⁴ Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore
      My sword will go out from its sheath against humanity from south to north. '
    5: '⁵ So humanity will know that I, the Lord, have drawn My sword from its sheath.
      It will not return to its sheath again.”’ '
    6: '⁶ As for you, son of man, groan with a breaking heart and bitter grief; you
      shall groan in their sight. '
    7: "⁷ And when they say to you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because\
      \ of the news, for it is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will go\
      \ limp, every spirit will be disheartened, and all knees will drip with water.\
      \ Behold, it is coming and it will happen,’ declares the Lord God.” \n"
    8: '⁸ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    9: "⁹ “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says:’ Say,\n‘A sword,\
      \ a sword sharpened\nAnd also polished!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharpened to make a slaughter,\nPolished to flash like lightning!’\nOr\
      \ shall we rejoice, the rod of My son despising every tree? "
    11: '¹¹ And it is given to be polished, so that it may be handled; the sword is
      sharpened and polished, to hand it over to the slaughterer. '
    12: '¹² Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against
      all the officials of Israel. They are turned over to the sword with My people,
      therefore slap your thigh. '
    13: "¹³ For there is a testing; and what if even the rod which despises will cease\
      \ to be?” declares the Lord God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “You therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands; and let the
      sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for
      the great one slain, which surrounds them, '
    15: '¹⁵ so that their hearts will waver, and many fall at all their gates. I have
      granted the slaughter of the sword. Oh! It is made for striking like lightning,
      it is sharpened in readiness for slaughter. '
    16: '¹⁶ Prove yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever
      your edge is ordered. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will also clap My hands, and I will satisfy My wrath; I, the Lord, have\
      \ spoken.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    19: '¹⁹ “Now as for you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of
      Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And make a signpost;
      make it at the head of the way to the city. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon,
      and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem. '
    21: '²¹ For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head
      of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household
      idols, he looks at the liver. '
    22: '²² Into his right hand came the divination, ‘Jerusalem,’ to set up battering
      rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to raise the voice with a battle cry,
      to set up battering rams against the gates, to pile up assault ramps, to build
      a siege wall. '
    23: "²³ And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have\
      \ sworn solemn oaths. But he makes guilt known, so that they may be seized.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because you have made your
      guilt known, in that your offenses are uncovered, so that in all your deeds
      your sins are seen—because you have come to mind, you will be seized by the
      hand. '
    25: '²⁵ And you, slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come,
      in the time of the punishment of the end,’ '
    26: '²⁶ this is what the Lord God says: ‘Remove the turban and take off the crown;
      this will no longer be the same. Exalt that which is low, and humble that which
      is high. '
    27: "²⁷ Ruins, ruins, ruins, I will make it! This also will be no longer until\
      \ He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says
      concerning the sons of Ammon and their taunting,’ and say: ‘A sword, a sword
      is drawn, sharpened for the slaughter, to make it consume, so that it may be
      like lightning— '
    29: '²⁹ while they see false visions for you, while they divine lies for you—to
      place you on the necks of the wicked who are killed, whose day has come, in
      the time of the punishment of the end. '
    30: '³⁰ Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land
      of your origin, I will judge you. '
    31: '³¹ I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire
      of My wrath, and I will hand you over to brutal men, craftsmen of destruction. '
    32: ³² You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land.
      You will not be remembered, for I, the Lord, have spoken.’”
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then
      inform her of all her abominations. '
    3: '³ And you shall say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “A city shedding blood
      in her midst, so that her time is coming; and a city that makes idols, contrary
      to her own good, for defilement! '
    4: '⁴ You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and you have become
      defiled by your idols which you have made. So you have brought your days closer
      and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a disgrace to the nations,
      and an object of mocking to all the lands. '
    5: "⁵ Those who are near and those who are far from you will make fun of you,\
      \ you of ill repute, full of turmoil. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Behold, the rulers of Israel, each according to his power, have been among
      you for the purpose of shedding blood. '
    7: '⁷ They have treated father and mother with contempt among you. They have oppressed
      the stranger in your midst; they have oppressed the orphan and the widow among
      you. '
    8: '⁸ You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths. '
    9: '⁹ Slanderous men have been among you for the purpose of shedding blood, and
      among you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your midst they have committed
      outrageous sin. '
    10: '¹⁰ Among you they have uncovered their fathers’ nakedness; among you they
      have abused her who was unclean in her menstruation. '
    11: '¹¹ And one has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife, another has
      outrageously defiled his daughter-in-law, and another among you has sexually
      abused his sister, his father’s daughter. '
    12: "¹² Among you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest,\
      \ you have injured your neighbors by oppression, and you have forgotten Me,”\
      \ declares the Lord God. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Behold, then, I strike with My hand your profit which you have made and
      the bloodshed which is among you. '
    14: '¹⁴ Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong for the days that I
      will deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken and will act. '
    15: '¹⁵ And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands,
      and I will eliminate your uncleanness from you. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then you will defile yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord.”’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, the house of Israel has become waste metal to Me; all of
      them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the smelting furnace; they are the waste
      metal of silver. '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because all of you have become
      waste metal, therefore, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. '
    20: '²⁰ As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the smelting furnace
      to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and
      in My wrath, and I will place you there and melt you. '
    21: '²¹ And I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you
      will be melted in the midst of it. '
    22: "²² As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst\
      \ of it; and you will know that I, the Lord, have poured out My wrath on you.’”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that is not clean or rained on
      in the day of indignation.’ '
    25: '²⁵ There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion
      tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious
      things; they have made many widows in the midst of her. '
    26: '²⁶ Her priests have done violence to My Law and have profaned My holy things;
      they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, and they have
      not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have closed
      their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am defiled among them. '
    27: '²⁷ Her leaders within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood
      and destroying lives in order to make dishonest profit. '
    28: '²⁸ And her prophets have coated with whitewash for them, seeing false visions
      and divining lies for them, saying, ‘This is what the Lord God says,’ when the
      Lord has not spoken. '
    29: '²⁹ The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery,
      and they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the stranger
      without justice. '
    30: '³⁰ I searched for a man among them who would build up a wall and stand in
      the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found
      no one. '
    31: ³¹ So I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with
      the fire of My wrath; I have brought their way upon their heads,” declares the
      Lord God.
  23:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; '
    3: '³ and they prostituted themselves in Egypt. They prostituted themselves in
      their youth; there their breasts were squeezed and there their virgin breasts
      were handled. '
    4: "⁴ Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became\
      \ Mine, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria\
      \ is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Oholah prostituted herself while she was Mine; and she lusted after her
      lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors, '
    6: '⁶ who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them handsome
      young men, horsemen riding on horses. '
    7: '⁷ She bestowed her obscene practices on them, all of whom were the choicest
      men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she
      defiled herself. '
    8: '⁸ She did not abandon her obscene practices from the time in Egypt; for in
      her youth men had slept with her, and they handled her virgin breasts and poured
      out their obscene practice on her. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, to the Assyrians, after whom
      she lusted. '
    10: "¹⁰ They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but\
      \ they killed her with the sword. So she became a subject of gossip among women,\
      \ and they executed judgments on her. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust
      than she, and her obscene practices were more than the prostitution of her sister. '
    12: '¹² She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near,
      opulently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them handsome young men. '
    13: '¹³ And I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way. '
    14: '¹⁴ So she increased her obscene practices. And she saw men carved on the
      wall, images of the Chaldeans drawn in bright red, '
    15: '¹⁵ wearing belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads,
      all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land
      of their birth. '
    16: '¹⁶ And when she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them
      in Chaldea. '
    17: '¹⁷ And the Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with
      their obscene practice. And when she had been defiled by them, she turned away
      from them in disgust. '
    18: '¹⁸ She exposed her obscene practices and exposed her nakedness; then I turned
      away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister in disgust. '
    19: '¹⁹ Yet she multiplied her obscene practices, remembering the days of her
      youth, when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys
      and whose discharge is like the discharge of horses. '
    21: "²¹ So you longed for the outrageous sin of your youth, when the Egyptians\
      \ handled your breasts because of the breasts of your youth. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold I am going
      to incite your lovers against you, from whom you turned away in disgust, and
      I will bring them against you from every side: '
    23: '²³ the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all
      the Assyrians with them; handsome young men, governors and officials all of
      them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. '
    24: '²⁴ And they will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and
      with a contingent of peoples. They will attack you on every side with shield,
      buckler, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge
      you according to their customs. '
    25: '²⁵ I will set My jealousy against you, so that they may deal with you in
      wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall
      by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors
      will be consumed by the fire. '
    26: '²⁶ They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful
      jewelry. '
    27: '²⁷ So I will remove from you your outrageous sin and your prostitution that
      you brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not raise your eyes to
      them or remember Egypt anymore.’ '
    28: '²⁸ For this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I am going to hand you over
      to those whom you hate, to those from whom you turned away in disgust. '
    29: '²⁹ They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you
      naked and bare. And the nakedness of your prostitution will be exposed, both
      your outrageous sin and your obscene practices. '
    30: '³⁰ These things will be done to you because you have adulterously pursued
      the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols. '
    31: '³¹ You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup
      in your hand.’ '
    32: "³² This is what the Lord God says:\n‘You will drink your sister’s cup,\n\
      Which is deep and wide.\nYou will be laughed at and held in derision;\nBecause\
      \ it contains much.\n"
    33: "³³ You will be filled with drunkenness and grief,\nA cup of horror and desolation,\n\
      The cup of your sister Samaria.\n"
    34: "³⁴ And you will drink it and drain it.\nThen you will gnaw on its fragments\n\
      And tear your breasts;\nfor I have spoken,’ declares the Lord God. "
    35: "³⁵ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because you have forgotten\
      \ Me and discarded Me behind your back, suffer on your own part the punishment\
      \ for your outrageous sin and your obscene practices.’” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Moreover, the Lord said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and
      Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. '
    37: '³⁷ For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. So they
      have committed adultery with their idols, and even made their sons, whom they
      bore to Me, pass through the fire to them as food. '
    38: '³⁸ Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the
      same day, and have profaned My Sabbaths. '
    39: "³⁹ For when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered\
      \ My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and behold, this is what they\
      \ did within My house. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from a great distance,
      to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came—for whom you bathed, put
      makeup on your eyes, and adorned yourselves with jewelry; '
    41: '⁴¹ and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged in front of it on
      which you had set My incense and My oil. '
    42: "⁴² And the sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and heavy drinkers\
      \ were brought from the wilderness with people from the multitude of humanity.\
      \ And they put bracelets on the wrists of the women and beautiful crowns on\
      \ their heads. \n"
    43: '⁴³ “Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, ‘Will they
      now commit adultery with her when she is like this?’ '
    44: '⁴⁴ But they went in to her as they would go in to a prostitute. This is how
      they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. '
    45: "⁴⁵ But they, righteous people, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses\
      \ and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses\
      \ and blood is on their hands. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “For this is what the Lord God says: ‘Bring up a contingent against them
      and turn them over to terror and plunder. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The contingent will stone them with stones and cut them down with their
      swords; they will kill their sons and their daughters and burn their houses
      with fire. '
    48: '⁴⁸ So I will eliminate outrageous conduct from the land, so that all women
      will take warning and not commit outrageous sin as you have done. '
    49: ⁴⁹ Your outrageous conduct will be repaid to you, and you will bear the guilt
      for your idols; so you will know that I am the Lord God.’”
  24:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month,
      on the tenth of the month, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon
      has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. '
    3: "³ Present a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, ‘This is what\

    5: "⁵ Take the choicest of the flock,\nAnd also stack wood under the pot.\nMake\
      \ it boil vigorously.\nAlso boil its bones in it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:\n“Woe to the bloody city,\n\
      To the pot in which there is rust\nAnd whose rust has not gone out of it!\n\
      Take out of it piece after piece,\nWithout making a choice.\n"
    7: "⁷ For her blood is in her midst;\nShe placed it on the bare rock;\nShe did\
      \ not pour it on the ground\nTo cover it with dust.\n"
    8: "⁸ So that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,\nI have put her\
      \ blood on the bare rock,\nSo that it will not be covered.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:\n“Woe to the bloody city!\nI\
      \ also will make the wood pile great.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Heap on the wood, kindle the fire,\nCook the meat thoroughly\nAnd mix\
      \ in the spices,\nAnd let the bones be burned up.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then set it empty on its burning coals\nSo that it may be hot\nAnd its\
      \ bronze may glow,\nAnd its filthiness may be melted in it,\nIts rust eliminated.\n"
    12: "¹² She has wearied Me with work,\nYet her great rust has not gone from her;\n\
      Let her rust be in the fire!\n"
    13: "¹³ In your filthiness is outrageous sin.\nBecause I would have cleansed you,\n\
      Yet you are not clean,\nYou will not be cleansed from your filthiness again\n\
      Until I have expended My wrath on you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I, the Lord, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not overlook,\
      \ I will not pity, and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according\
      \ to your deeds I will judge you,” declares the Lord God.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '

      eyes with a fatal blow; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep, and
      your tears shall not come. '
    17: '¹⁷ Groan silently; do no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put
      your sandals on your feet, and do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the
      bread of other people.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died.
      And in the morning I did as I was commanded. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean
      for us, that you are doing?” '
    20: '²⁰ Then I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    21: '²¹ ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “This is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold,

    23: '²³ Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You
      will not mourn and you will not weep; but you will rot away in your guilty deeds,

    24: "²⁴ So Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you\

  25:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '

    4: '⁴ therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the people of the east as a
      possession, and they will set up their encampments among you and make their

    5: '⁵ I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and the sons of Ammon a resting
      place for flocks. Then you will know that I am the Lord.” '
    6: '⁶ For this is what the Lord God says: “Because you have clapped your hands

      Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim; '
    10: '¹⁰ and I will give it as a possession along with the sons of Ammon to the

  26:
    1: '¹ Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the Lord

    4: '⁴ They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers; and I will
      sweep her debris away from her and make her a bare rock. '
    5: '⁵ She will become a dry place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
      sea, for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord God; ‘and she will become plunder
      for the nations. '
    6: "⁶ Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be killed by the sword,\
      \ and they will know that I am the Lord.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ For the Lord God says this: “Behold, I am going to bring upon Tyre from
      the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots,
      cavalry, and a great army. '
    8: '⁸ He will kill your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will
      make siege walls against you, pile up an assault ramp against you, and raise
      up a large shield against you. '
    9: '⁹ And he will direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls, and
      he will tear down your towers with his axes. '
    10: '¹⁰ Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust raised by them will cover
      you; your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots when
      he enters your gates as warriors enter a city that is breached. '
    11: '¹¹ With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will
      kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will go down to the
      ground. '
    12: '¹² Also they will take your riches as spoils and plunder your merchandise,
      tear down your walls and destroy your delightful houses, and throw your stones,
      your timbers, and your debris into the water. '
    13: '¹³ So I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your

    16: '¹⁶ Then all the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove
      their robes, and strip off their colorfully woven garments. They will clothe

    4: '⁴ then someone who hears the sound of the horn but does not take warning,
      and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. '
    5: '⁵ He heard the sound of the horn but did not take warning; his blood will
      be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have saved his life. '
    6: "⁶ But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the horn and\
      \ the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them,\
      \ he is taken away for his wrongdoing; but I will require his blood from the\
      \ watchman’s hand.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the
      house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them a warning
      from Me. '
    8: '⁸ When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will certainly die,’ and
      you do not speak to warn the wicked about his way, that wicked person shall
      die for his wrongdoing, but I will require his blood from your hand. '
    9: "⁹ But if you on your part warn a wicked person to turn from his way and he\
      \ does not turn from his way, he will die for his wrongdoing, but you have saved\
      \ your life. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what
      you have said: “Surely our offenses and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting
      away in them; how then can we survive?”’ '
    11: '¹¹ Say to them, ‘As I live!’ declares the Lord God, ‘I take no pleasure at
      all in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way
      and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then should you die,
      house of Israel?’ '
    12: '¹² And you, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, ‘The righteousness of
      a righteous one will not save him on the day of his offense, and as for the
      wickedness of a wicked one, he will not stumble because of it on the day when
      he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous one will not be able to live
      by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.’ '
    13: '¹³ When I say to the righteous that he will certainly live, and he so trusts
      in his righteousness that he commits injustice, none of his righteous deeds
      will be remembered; but for that same injustice of his which he has committed
      he will die. '
    14: '¹⁴ But when I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and he turns from
      his sin and practices justice and righteousness, '
    15: '¹⁵ if a wicked person returns a pledge, pays back what he has taken by robbery,
      walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing injustice, he shall
      certainly live; he shall not die. '
    16: "¹⁶ None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him.\
      \ He has practiced justice and righteousness; he shall certainly live. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Yet your fellow citizens say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right,’ when
      it is their own way that is not right. '
    18: '¹⁸ When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits injustice,
      then he shall die in it. '
    19: '¹⁹ But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and
      righteousness, he will live by them. '
    20: "²⁰ Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ I will judge each of\
      \ you according to his ways, house of Israel.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month,
      the survivor from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been taken.” '
    22: "²² Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before the survivors\
      \ came. And He opened my mouth at the time they came to me in the morning; so\
      \ my mouth was opened and I was no longer speechless. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Son of man, they who live in these ruins in the land of Israel are saying,
      ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many the
      land has been given as a possession.’ '
    25: '²⁵ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “You eat meat
      with the blood in it, raise your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should
      you then possess the land? '
    26: '²⁶ You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles
      his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?”’ '
    27: '²⁷ You shall say this to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: “As I live,
      those who are in the places of ruins certainly will fall by the sword, and whoever
      is in the open field I will give to the animals to be devoured, and those who
      are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of plague. '
    28: '²⁸ And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her
      power will be brought to an end; and the mountains of Israel will be deserted
      so that no one will pass through. '
    29: "²⁹ Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I make the land a desolation\
      \ and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk with one another
      about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak one with another,
      each with his brother, saying, ‘Come now and hear what the message is that comes
      from the Lord.’ '
    31: '³¹ And they come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and
      hear your words, but they do not do them; for they do the lustful desires expressed
      by their mouth, and their heart follows their unlawful gain. '
    32: '³² And behold, you are to them like a love song by one who has a beautiful
      voice and plays well on an instrument; for they hear your words but they do
      not practice them. '
    33: ³³ So when it comes—as it certainly will—then they will know that a prophet
      has been among them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say
      to those shepherds, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Woe, shepherds of Israel
      who have been feeding themselves! Should the shepherds not feed the flock? '
    3: '³ You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat
      sheep without feeding the flock. '
    4: '⁴ Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not
      healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought
      back, nor have you searched for the lost; but with force and with violence you
      have dominated them. '
    5: '⁵ They scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every animal
      of the field and scattered. '
    6: "⁶ My flock strayed through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock\
      \ was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search\
      \ or seek for them.”’” \n"
    7: '⁷ Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    8: '⁸ “As I live,” declares the Lord God, “certainly, because My flock has become
      plunder, and My flock has become food for all the animals of the field for lack
      of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but rather the
      shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock, '
    9: '⁹ therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    10: "¹⁰ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds,\
      \ and I will demand My sheep from them and make them stop tending sheep. So\
      \ the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will save My sheep from\
      \ their mouth, so that they will not be food for them.”’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the Lord God says this: “Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep
      and look after them. '
    12: '¹² As a shepherd cares for his flock on a day when he is among his scattered
      sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will rescue them from all the places
      where they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries
      and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel,
      by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing place will be on
      the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down in a good grazing place
      and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ I Myself will feed My flock and I Myself will lead them to rest,” declares
      the Lord God. '
    16: "¹⁶ “I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken, and\
      \ strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will eliminate. I will feed\
      \ them with judgment. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “As for you, My flock, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I am going
      to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats. '
    18: '¹⁸ Is it too little a thing for you to feed in the good pasture, that you
      must trample with your feet the rest of your pastures? Or too little for you
      to drink the clear waters, that you must muddy the rest with your feet? '
    19: "¹⁹ But as for My flock, they must eat what you trample with your feet, and\
      \ drink what you muddy with your feet!’” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says to them: “Behold, I, I Myself
      will also judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. '
    21: '²¹ Since you push away with your side and shoulder, and gore all the weak
      with your horns until you have scattered them abroad, '
    22: "²² therefore, I will save My flock, and they will no longer be plunder; and\
      \ I will judge between one sheep and another. \n"
    23: '²³ “Then I will appoint over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he
      will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd. '
    24: "²⁴ And I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince\
      \ among them; I the Lord have spoken. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “And I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful animals
      from the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in
      the woods. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will
      make showers fall in their season; they will be showers of blessing. '
    27: '²⁷ Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit and the earth will yield
      its produce, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that
      I am the Lord, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have saved them
      from the hand of those who enslaved them. '
    28: '²⁸ They will no longer be plunder to the nations, and the animals of the
      earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make
      them afraid. '
    29: '²⁹ I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will not
      again be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults
      of the nations anymore. '
    30: '³⁰ Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and that
      they, the house of Israel, are My people,” declares the Lord God. '
    31: ³¹ “As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are mankind, and I
      am your God,” declares the Lord God.
  35:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it '
    3: "³ and say to it, ‘This is what the Lord God says:\n“Behold, I am against you,\
      \ Mount Seir,\nAnd I will reach out with My hand against you\nAnd make you a\
      \ desolation and a waste.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will turn your cities to ruins,\nAnd you will become a desolation.\nThen\
      \ you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Since you have had everlasting hostility and have turned over the sons of
      Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time
      of the punishment of the end, '
    6: '⁶ therefore as I live,” declares the Lord God, “I will certainly doom you
      to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed,
      therefore bloodshed will pursue you. '
    7: '⁷ I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will eliminate from
      it one who passes through and returns. '
    8: '⁸ I will fill its mountains with its slain; those killed by the sword will
      fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines. '
    9: "⁹ I will make you a permanent desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited.\
      \ Then you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Since you have said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will be mine,
      and we will possess them,’ although the Lord was there, '
    11: '¹¹ therefore as I live,” declares the Lord God, “I will deal with you according
      to your anger and according to your envy which you displayed because of your
      hatred for them; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you. '
    12: '¹² Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all your insults which
      you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, ‘They are desolate;
      they have been given to us as food.’ '
    13: '¹³ And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words
      against Me; I Myself have heard it.” '
    14: '¹⁴ This is what the Lord God says: “As all the earth rejoices, I will make
      you a desolation. '
    15: ¹⁵ As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it
      was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, Mount Seir, and
      all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”’
  36:
    1: '¹ “Now you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘You
      mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. '
    2: '² This is what the Lord God says: “Since the enemy has spoken against you,
      ‘Aha!’ and, ‘The everlasting heights have become our possession,’ '
    3: '³ therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “For good reason
      they have made you desolate and harassed you from every side, so that you would
      become a possession of the rest of the nations; and you have been taken up in
      the talk and the rumor of the people.”’” '
    4: '⁴ Therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. This
      is what the Lord God says to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines
      and to the valleys, to the desolate ruins and to the abandoned cities which
      have become plunder and an object of ridicule to the rest of the nations which
      are all around— '
    5: '⁵ therefore the Lord God says this: “Certainly in the fire of My jealousy
      I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated
      My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with contempt
      of soul, in order to make its pastureland plunder.” '
    6: '⁶ Therefore prophesy in regard to the land of Israel and say to the mountains
      and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, “This is what the Lord
      God says: ‘Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you
      have endured the insults of the nations.’ '
    7: '⁷ Therefore the Lord God says this: ‘I have sworn that the nations that are
      around you will certainly endure their insults themselves. '
    8: '⁸ But as for you, mountains of Israel, you will grow your branches and bear
      fruit for My people Israel; for they are about to come. '
    9: '⁹ For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be cultivated
      and sown. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I will multiply people on you, all the house of Israel, all of it;
      and the cities will be inhabited and the ruins will be rebuilt. '
    11: '¹¹ I will multiply on you people and animals, and they will increase and
      be fruitful; and I will populate you as you were previously, and treat you better
      than at the beginning. Then you will know that I am the Lord. '
    12: "¹² Yes, I will have people—My people Israel—walk on you and possess you,\
      \ so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of\
      \ children.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “The Lord God says this: ‘Since they say to you, “You are a devourer of
      people and have bereaved your nation of children,” '
    14: '¹⁴ for that reason you will no longer devour people and no longer bereave
      your nation of children,’ declares the Lord God. '
    15: "¹⁵ I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you\
      \ suffer disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you make your nation\
      \ stumble any longer,” declares the Lord God.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, when the house of Israel was living on their own land, they
      defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness
      of a woman in her impurity. '
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed
      on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I also scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout
      the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them. '
    20: '²⁰ When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name,
      because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of the Lord, yet they have
      left His land.’ '
    21: "²¹ But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned\
      \ among the nations where they went. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says:
      “It is not for your sake, house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My
      holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went. '
    23: '²³ And I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned
      among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will
      know that I am the Lord,” declares the Lord God, “when I show Myself holy among
      you in their sight. '
    24: '²⁴ For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the lands;
      and I will bring you into your own land. '
    25: '²⁵ Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will
      cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. '
    26: '²⁶ Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you;
      and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of
      flesh. '
    27: '²⁷ And I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in
      My statutes, and are careful and follow My ordinances. '
    28: '²⁸ And you will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you
      will be My people, and I will be your God. '
    29: '²⁹ Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for
      the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you. '
    30: '³⁰ Instead, I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the
      field, so that you will not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations. '
    31: '³¹ Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good,
      and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your wrongdoings and your
      abominations. '
    32: "³² I am not doing this for your sake,” declares the Lord God; “let that be\
      \ known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated for your ways, house of Israel!” \n"
    33: '³³ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “On the day that I cleanse you from all
      your wrongdoings, I will populate the cities, and the places of ruins will be
      rebuilt. '
    34: '³⁴ The desolated land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in
      the sight of everyone who passes by. '
    35: '³⁵ And they will say, ‘This desolated land has become like the Garden of
      Eden; and the waste, desolated and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’ '
    36: "³⁶ Then the nations around you that are left will know that I, the Lord,\
      \ have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolated; I, the\
      \ Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “This too I will let the house of Israel
      ask Me to do for them: I will increase their people like a flock. '
    38: ³⁸ Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed
      feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they
      will know that I am the Lord.”’”
  37:
    1: '¹ The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of
      the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. '
    2: '² He had me pass among them all around, and behold, there were very many on
      the surface of the valley; and behold, they were very dry. '
    3: '³ Then He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered,
      “Lord God, You Yourself know.” '
    4: '⁴ Again He said to me, “Prophesy over these bones and say to them, ‘You dry
      bones, hear the word of the Lord.’ '
    5: '⁵ This is what the Lord God says to these bones: ‘Behold, I am going to make
      breath enter you so that you may come to life. '
    6: "⁶ And I will attach tendons to you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you\
      \ with skin, and put breath in you so that you may come to life; and you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a loud
      noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. '
    8: '⁸ And I looked, and behold, tendons were on them, and flesh grew and skin
      covered them; but there was no breath in them. '
    9: '⁹ Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say
      to the breath, ‘The Lord God says this: “Come from the four winds, breath, and
      breathe on these slain, so that they come to life.”’” '
    10: "¹⁰ So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath entered them, and they\
      \ came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the entire house of Israel;
      behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are
      completely cut off.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold,
      I am going to open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves,
      My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves
      and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people. '
    14: "¹⁴ And I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life, and I will\
      \ place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken\
      \ and done it,” declares the Lord.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The word of the Lord came again to me, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Now you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, ‘For
      Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions’; then take another stick and
      write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel,
      his companions.’ '
    17: '¹⁷ Then put them together for yourself one to another into one stick, so
      that they may become one in your hand. '
    18: '¹⁸ And when the sons of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not declare
      to us what you mean by these?’ '
    19: '¹⁹ say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am going to take
      the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel,
      his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make
      them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.”’ '
    20: '²⁰ The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes. '
    21: '²¹ And say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am going
      to take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and
      I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; '
    22: '²² and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel;
      and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations,
      and no longer be divided into two kingdoms. '
    23: "²³ They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their\
      \ detestable things, or with any of their offenses; but I will rescue them from\
      \ all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them.\
      \ And they will be My people, and I will be their God. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “And My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one
      shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances, and keep My statutes and follow
      them. '
    25: '²⁵ And they will live on the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, in which
      your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their
      sons’ sons, forever; and My servant David will be their leader forever. '
    26: '²⁶ And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting
      covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and set My sanctuary
      in their midst forever. '
    27: '²⁷ My dwelling place also will be among them; and I will be their God, and
      they will be My people. '
    28: ²⁸ And the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when
      My sanctuary is in their midst forever.”’”
  38:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince
      of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog,
      chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. '
    4: '⁴ So I will turn you around and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring
      you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them magnificently dressed,
      a great contingent with shield and buckler, all of them wielding swords; '
    5: '⁵ Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with buckler and helmet; '
    6: "⁶ Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north\
      \ with all its troops—many peoples with you. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Be ready, and be prepared, you and all your contingents that are assembled
      around you, and be a guard for them. '
    8: '⁸ After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come
      into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been gathered
      from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had been a continual place
      of ruins; but its people were brought out from the nations, and they are living
      securely, all of them. '
    9: "⁹ And you will go up, you will come like a storm; you will be like a cloud\
      \ covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “It will come about on that day, that
      thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan, '
    11: '¹¹ and you will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages.
      I will go against those who are at rest, who live securely, all of them living
      without walls and having no bars or gates, '
    12: '¹² to capture spoils and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the
      ruins that are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered from the
      nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who live at the center of the
      world.’ '
    13: "¹³ Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will\
      \ say to you, ‘Have you come to capture spoils? Have you assembled your contingent\
      \ to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and\
      \ goods, to capture great spoils?’”’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, ‘This is what the Lord
      God says: “On that day when My people Israel are living securely, will you not
      know it? '
    15: '¹⁵ You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you
      and many peoples with you, all of them riding horses, a large assembly and a
      mighty army; '
    16: "¹⁶ and you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud to cover the\
      \ land. It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against My\
      \ land, so that the nations may know Me when I show Myself holy through you\
      \ before their eyes, Gog.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Are you the one of whom I spoke in former
      days through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days
      for many years that I would bring you against them? '
    18: '¹⁸ It will come about on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel,”
      declares the Lord God, “that My fury will mount up in My anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ In My zeal and in My blazing wrath I declare that on that day there will
      certainly be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, all
      the crawling things that crawl on the earth, and all mankind who are on the
      face of the earth will shake at My presence; and the mountains will be thrown
      down, the steep pathways will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground. '
    21: '²¹ And I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains,” declares
      the Lord God. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother. '
    22: '²² With plague and with blood I will enter into judgment with him; and I
      will rain on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him,
      a torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone. '
    23: ²³ So I will prove Myself great, show Myself holy, and make Myself known in
      the sight of many nations; and they will know that I am the Lord.”’
  39:
    1: '¹ “And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, ‘This is what the Lord
      God says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; '
    2: '² and I will turn you around, lead you on a rope, take you up from the remotest
      parts of the north, and bring you against the mountains of Israel. '
    3: '³ Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows fall
      from your right hand. '
    4: '⁴ You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops, and the
      peoples who are with you; I will give you as food to every kind of predatory
      bird and animal of the field. '
    5: '⁵ You will fall on the open field; for it is I who have spoken,” declares
      the Lord God. '
    6: "⁶ “And I will send fire upon Magog and those who inhabit the coastlands in\
      \ safety; and they will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    7: '⁷ “And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel; and
      I will not allow My holy name to be profaned anymore. But the nations will know
      that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel. '
    8: "⁸ Behold, it is coming and it shall be done,” declares the Lord God. “That\
      \ is the day of which I have spoken. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Then those who inhabit the cities of Israel will go out and make fires
      with the weapons and burn them, both bucklers and shields, bows and arrows,
      war clubs and spears, and for seven years they will make fires of them. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will not take wood from the field or gather firewood from the forests,\
      \ because they will make fires with the weapons; and they will take the spoils\
      \ of those who plundered them and seize the plunder of those who plundered them,”\
      \ declares the Lord God. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “On that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley
      of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block the way of those who
      would pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will
      call it the Valley of Hamon-gog. '
    12: '¹² For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to
      cleanse the land. '
    13: '¹³ And all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to their
      renown on the day that I appear in My glory,” declares the Lord God. '
    14: '¹⁴ “They will also select men who will constantly pass through the land,
      burying those who were passing through, those left on the surface of the ground,
      in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will conduct a search. '
    15: '¹⁵ As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a human
      bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the burial detail has buried
      it in the Valley of Hamon-gog. '
    16: "¹⁶ And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the\
      \ land.”’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Now as for you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Say to every
      kind of bird and to every animal of the field: “Assemble and come, gather from
      every direction to My sacrifice, which I am going to sacrifice for you as a
      great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel; and you will eat flesh and drink
      blood. '
    18: '¹⁸ You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the leaders
      of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all of them
      fattened livestock of Bashan. '
    19: '¹⁹ So you will eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are
      drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. '
    20: "²⁰ You will eat your fill at My table with horses and charioteers, with warriors\
      \ and all the men of war,” declares the Lord God. \n"
    21: '²¹ “And I will place My glory among the nations; and all the nations will
      see My judgment which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them. '
    22: '²² And the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God, from that
      day onward. '
    23: '²³ The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their
      wrongdoing, because they were disloyal to Me, and I hid My face from them; so
      I handed them over to their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword. '
    24: "²⁴ In accordance with their uncleanness and their offenses I dealt with them,\
      \ and I hid My face from them.”’” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Therefore this is what the Lord God says: “Now I will restore the fortunes
      of Jacob and have mercy on all the house of Israel; and I will be jealous for
      My holy name. '
    26: '²⁶ They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated
      against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them
      afraid. '
    27: '²⁷ When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands
      of their enemies, then I shall show Myself holy through them in the sight of
      the many nations. '
    28: '²⁸ Then they will know that I am the Lord their God because I made them go
      into exile among the nations, and then I gathered them again to their own land;
      and I will leave none of them there any longer. '
    29: ²⁹ I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out
      My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord God.
  40:
    1: '¹ In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on
      the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on
      this very day the hand of the Lord was upon me and He brought me there. '
    2: '² In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on
      a very high mountain, and on it to the south there was something like a structure
      of a city. '
    3: '³ So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was
      like the appearance of bronze, with a thread of flax and a measuring rod in
      his hand; and he was standing in the gateway. '
    4: "⁴ And the man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your\
      \ ears, and pay attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been\
      \ brought here in order to show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all\
      \ that you see.” \n"
    5: '⁵ And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and
      in the man’s hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, each of which was a cubit
      and a hand width. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the
      height, one rod. '
    6: '⁶ Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps, and measured
      the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold was one
      rod in width. '
    7: '⁷ The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; and there were five cubits
      between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate
      facing inward was one rod. '
    8: '⁸ Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod. '
    9: '⁹ And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars,
      two cubits. And the porch of the gate was faced inward. '
    10: '¹⁰ The guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side;
      the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same
      measurement on each side. '
    11: '¹¹ And he measured the width of the gateway, ten cubits, and the length of
      the gate, thirteen cubits. '
    12: '¹² There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on
      each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side. '
    13: '¹³ And he measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof
      of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, from one door to the door opposite. '
    14: '¹⁴ He made the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gate extended all around
      to the side pillar of the courtyard. '
    15: '¹⁵ And from the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch
      of the gate was fifty cubits. '
    16: "¹⁶ And there were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms, and toward\
      \ their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches.\
      \ And there were windows all around inside; and on each side pillar were palm\
      \ tree decorations. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then he brought me into the outer courtyard, and behold, there were chambers
      and a stone pavement made for the courtyard all around; thirty chambers faced
      the pavement. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the pavement (that is, the lower pavement) was by the side of the
      gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front\
      \ of the exterior of the inner courtyard, a hundred cubits on the east and on\
      \ the north. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And as for the gate of the outer courtyard which faced north, he measured
      its length and its width. '
    21: '²¹ It had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches
      had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and
      the width twenty-five cubits. '
    22: '²² Its windows, its porches, and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements
      as the gate which faced east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch
      was in front of them. '
    23: "²³ The inner courtyard had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well\
      \ as the gate on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the
      south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same
      measurements. '
    25: '²⁵ The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows;
      the length was fifty cubits and the width, twenty-five cubits. '
    26: '²⁶ There were seven steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of
      them; and it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. '
    27: "²⁷ The inner courtyard had a gate toward the south; and he measured from\
      \ gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he brought me to the inner courtyard by the south gate; and he measured
      the south gate according to those same measurements. '
    29: '²⁹ Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches were according
      to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around;
      it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    30: '³⁰ There were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits
      wide. '
    31: "³¹ And its porches were toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations\
      \ were on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps. \n"
    32: '³² Then he brought me into the inner courtyard toward the east. And he measured
      the gate according to those same measurements. '
    33: '³³ Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches were according
      to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around;
      it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    34: "³⁴ Its porches were toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations\
      \ were on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.\
      \ \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to
      those same measurements, '
    36: '³⁶ with its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its porches. And the gate had
      windows all around; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. '
    37: "³⁷ And its side pillars were toward the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations\
      \ were on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.\
      \ \n"
    38: '³⁸ A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there
      they rinse the burnt offering. '
    39: '³⁹ And in the porch of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to
      slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On the outer side, as one went up to the gateway toward the north, were
      two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables. '
    41: '⁴¹ Four tables were on each side next to the gate; eight tables on which
      they slaughter sacrifices. '
    42: '⁴² For the burnt offering there were four tables of cut stone, a cubit and
      a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they set
      the utensils with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice. '
    43: "⁴³ And the double hooks, one hand width in length, were installed in the\
      \ house all around; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the
      inner courtyard, one of which was at the side of the north gate, with its front
      toward the south, and one at the side of the south gate facing north. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Then he said to me, “This is the chamber which faces south, intended for
      the priests who are responsible for the temple; '
    46: '⁴⁶ but the chamber which faces north is for the priests who are responsible
      for the altar. They are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near
      to the Lord to serve Him.” '
    47: "⁴⁷ He measured the courtyard, a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and\
      \ a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each side pillar
      of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three
      cubits on each side. '
    49: ⁴⁹ The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits;
      and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side
      pillars, one on each side.
  41:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me to the sanctuary, and he measured the side pillars: six
      cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar. '
    2: '² The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the sides of the entrance were
      five cubits on each side. He also measured the length of the sanctuary, forty
      cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. '
    3: '³ Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits,
      and the doorway, six cubits high; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits. '
    4: "⁴ And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits,\
      \ before the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the
      side chambers, four cubits, all around the house on every side. '
    6: '⁶ The side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in
      each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their
      inward side all around, so that they could be attached, but not be attached
      to the wall of the temple itself. '
    7: '⁷ And the side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive
      story. Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on
      all sides of the temple, for that reason the width of the temple increased as
      it went higher; and so one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way
      of the second story. '
    8: '⁸ I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations
      of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height. '
    9: '⁹ The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But
      the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple '
    10: '¹⁰ and the outer chambers was twenty cubits in width around the temple on
      every side. '
    11: "¹¹ The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one\
      \ doorway toward the north, and another doorway toward the south; and the width\
      \ of the free space was five cubits all around. \n"
    12: "¹² The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward\
      \ the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits\
      \ thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area
      with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long. '
    14: "¹⁴ Also the width of the front of the temple and that of the separate areas\
      \ along the east side totaled a hundred cubits. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And he measured the length of the building along the front of the separate
      area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; he also measured
      the inner sanctuary and the porches of the courtyard. '
    16: '¹⁶ The thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries all around their
      three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and
      from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered), '
    17: '¹⁷ over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on
      all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement. '
    18: '¹⁸ It was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between
      cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces: '
    19: '¹⁹ a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion’s face
      toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all
      around. '
    20: "²⁰ From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved,\
      \ as well as on the wall of the sanctuary. \n"
    21: '²¹ The doorposts of the sanctuary were square; as for the front of the inner
      sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other. '
    22: '²² The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; its
      corners, its base, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, “This is the
      table that is before the Lord.” '
    23: '²³ The sanctuary and the inner sanctuary each had a double door. '
    24: '²⁴ Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for
      one door and two leaves for the other. '
    25: '²⁵ Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the main room, cherubim
      and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and there was a threshold of
      wood on the front of the porch outside. '
    26: ²⁶ And there were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other,
      on the sides of the porch; the same were on the side chambers of the house and
      the thresholds.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard, the way toward the north;
      and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite
      the building toward the north. '
    2: '² Along the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door; the width
      was fifty cubits. '
    3: '³ Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner courtyard, and opposite
      the stone pavement which belonged to the outer courtyard, was gallery corresponding
      to gallery in three stories. '
    4: '⁴ In front of the chambers was an inner passage ten cubits wide, a way of
      one hundred cubits; and their openings were on the north. '
    5: '⁵ Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space
      away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building. '
    6: '⁶ For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the
      courtyards; for that reason the upper chambers were set back from the ground
      upward, more than the lower and middle ones. '
    7: '⁷ As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer courtyard
      facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits. '
    8: '⁸ For the length of the chambers which were in the outer courtyard was fifty
      cubits; and behold, the length of those facing the main room was a hundred cubits. '
    9: "⁹ And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters\
      \ them from the outer courtyard. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ In the thickness of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, facing
      the separate area and facing the building, there were chambers. '
    11: '¹¹ And the way in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers which
      were on the north; according to their length, so was their width, and all their
      exits were according to their building plans and openings. '
    12: "¹² Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south\
      \ was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward\
      \ the east, as one enters them. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which
      are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests
      who are near to the Lord shall eat the most holy things. There they shall set
      the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering;
      for the place is holy. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the priests enter, they shall not go out into the outer courtyard\
      \ from the sanctuary without laying their garments there in which they minister,\
      \ for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach\
      \ that which is for the people.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out
      by way of the gate which faced east, and measured it all around. '
    16: '¹⁶ He measured on the east side with the measuring rod: five hundred rods
      by the measuring rod. '
    17: '¹⁷ He measured on the north side: five hundred rods by the measuring rod. '
    18: '¹⁸ On the south side he measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod. '
    19: '¹⁹ He turned to the west side and measured five hundred rods with the measuring
      rod. '
    20: ²⁰ He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length
      five hundred rods and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and
      the common.
  43:
    1: '¹ Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east; '
    2: '² and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the
      east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone from
      His glory. '
    3: '³ And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision
      which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the
      vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. '
    4: '⁴ And the glory of the Lord entered the house by way of the gate facing east. '
    5: "⁵ And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard; and\
      \ behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing
      beside me. '
    7: '⁷ And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place
      of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever.
      And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor
      their kings, by their prostitution and by the corpses of their kings when they
      die, '
    8: '⁸ by putting their threshold by My threshold, and their door post beside My
      door post, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My
      holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed
      them in My anger. '
    9: "⁹ Now let them remove their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far\
      \ from Me, and I will dwell among them forever. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “As for you, son of man, inform the house of Israel of the temple, so
      that they will be ashamed of their wrongdoings; and have them measure the plan. '
    11: '¹¹ And if they are ashamed of everything that they have done, make known
      to them the plan of the house, its layout, its exits, its entrances, all its
      plans, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it in their sight, so that
      they may observe its entire plan and all its statutes and execute them. '
    12: "¹² This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain\
      \ all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. \n"
    13: '¹³ “And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being
      a cubit and a hand width): the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit,
      and its border on its edge all around one span; and this shall be the height
      of the base of the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ And from the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits,
      and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall
      be four cubits, and the width one cubit. '
    15: '¹⁵ The altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall
      extend upward four horns. '
    16: '¹⁶ Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square
      in its four sides. '
    17: "¹⁷ And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four\
      \ sides, the border around it shall be half a cubit, and its base shall be a\
      \ cubit all around; and its steps shall face east.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And He said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: ‘These
      are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings
      on it and to sprinkle blood on it. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the descendants of
      Zadok, who come near to Me to serve Me,’ declares the Lord God, ‘a bull as a
      sin offering. '
    20: '²⁰ And you shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and
      on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around; so you shall
      cleanse it and make atonement for it. '
    21: "²¹ You shall also take the bull as the sin offering, and it shall be burned\
      \ in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary. \n"
    22: '²² ‘And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish as
      a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar from sin as they cleansed it
      with the bull. '
    23: '²³ When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a bull without blemish
      and a ram without blemish from the flock. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt
      on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ For seven days you shall prepare a goat as a sin offering daily; also
      a bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish, shall be prepared. '
    26: '²⁶ For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it;
      so shall they consecrate it. '
    27: ²⁷ When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and
      onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your
      peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ declares the Lord God.”
  44:
    1: '¹ Then He brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which
      faces east; and it was shut. '
    2: '² And the Lord said to me, “This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened,
      and no one shall enter by it, for the Lord God of Israel has entered by it;
      therefore it shall be shut. '
    3: "³ As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the\
      \ Lord; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and shall go out by the\
      \ same way.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and
      I looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord, and
      I fell on my face. '
    5: '⁵ And the Lord said to me, “Son of man, pay attention, see with your eyes
      and hear with your ears everything that I say to you concerning all the statutes
      of the house of the Lord and all its laws; and pay attention to the entrance
      of the house, with all the exits of the sanctuary. '
    6: '⁶ You shall say to the rebellious ones, to the house of Israel, ‘This is what
      the Lord God says: “Enough of all your abominations, house of Israel, '
    7: '⁷ when you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised
      in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to profane it, My house, when you offered My
      food, the fat, and the blood and they broke My covenant—this in addition to
      all your abominations. '
    8: "⁸ And you have not taken responsibility for My holy things yourselves, but\
      \ you have appointed foreigners to take responsibility for My sanctuary.” \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and
      uncircumcised in flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel,
      shall enter My sanctuary. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the Levites who went far from Me when Israel went astray, who went
      astray from Me following their idols, shall suffer the punishment for their
      wrongdoing. '
    11: '¹¹ Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates
      of the house and ministering in the house; they shall slaughter the burnt offering
      and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister
      to them. '
    12: '¹² Since they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling
      block of wrongdoing to the house of Israel, for that reason I have sworn against
      them,” declares the Lord God, “that they shall suffer the punishment for their
      wrongdoing. '
    13: '¹³ And they shall not approach Me to serve as priests for Me, nor approach
      any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear
      their shame and their abominations which they have committed. '
    14: "¹⁴ Nevertheless I will appoint them to take responsibility for the house,\
      \ of all its service and of everything that shall be done in it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who took responsibility
      for My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near
      to Me to serve Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the
      blood,” declares the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ “They shall enter My sanctuary; they shall come near to My table to serve
      Me and assume the responsibility I give them. '
    17: '¹⁷ And it shall be that when they enter at the gates of the inner courtyard,
      they shall be clothed with linen garments; and wool shall not be worn by them
      while they are ministering in the gates of the inner courtyard or in the house. '
    18: '¹⁸ Linen turbans shall be on their heads and linen undergarments shall be
      around their waists; they shall not put on anything that makes them sweat. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when they go out into the outer courtyard, into the outer courtyard
      to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have been ministering
      and lay them in the holy chambers; then they shall put on other garments, so
      that they will not transfer holiness to the people with their garments. '
    20: '²⁰ Also they shall not shave their heads, yet they shall not let their locks
      grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads. '
    21: '²¹ Nor shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard. '
    22: '²² And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but shall take virgins
      from the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of
      a priest. '
    23: '²³ Moreover, they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and
      the common, and teach them to distinguish between the unclean and the clean. '
    24: '²⁴ In a dispute they shall take their stand to judge; they shall judge it
      according to My ordinances. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in
      all My appointed feasts, and sanctify My Sabbaths. '
    25: '²⁵ They shall not go to a dead person to defile themselves; however, for
      father, for mother, for son, for daughter, for brother, or for a sister who
      has not had a husband, they may defile themselves. '
    26: '²⁶ And after he is cleansed, seven days shall elapse for him. '
    27: "²⁷ On the day that he goes into the sanctuary, to the inner courtyard to\
      \ minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” declares the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    28: '²⁸ “And it shall be regarding an inheritance for them, that I am their inheritance;
      and you shall give them no property in Israel—I am their property. '
    29: '²⁹ They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering;
      and everything banned from secular use in Israel shall be theirs. '
    30: '³⁰ And the first of all the first fruits of every kind and every contribution
      of every kind, from all your contributions, shall be for the priests; you shall
      also give to the priest the first of your dough, to make a blessing rest on
      your house. '
    31: ³¹ The priests shall not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death
      or has been torn to pieces by animals.
  45:
    1: '¹ “Now when you divide the land by lot for inheritance, you shall offer an
      allotment to the Lord, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be a length
      of twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width shall be twenty thousand. It shall
      be holy within its entire surrounding boundary. '
    2: '² Out of this there shall be for the sanctuary a square encompassing five
      hundred by five hundred cubits, and fifty cubits for its open space round about. '
    3: '³ From this area you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand cubits
      and a width of ten thousand cubits; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most
      Holy Place. '
    4: '⁴ It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the
      ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve the Lord, and it shall be
      a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. '
    5: "⁵ An area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width\
      \ shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, and for their possession\
      \ cities in which to live. \n"
    6: "⁶ “And you shall give the city possession of an area five thousand cubits\
      \ wide and twenty-five thousand cubits long, alongside the allotment of the\
      \ holy portion; it shall be for the entire house of Israel. \n"
    7: '⁷ “And the prince shall have land on either side of the holy allotment and
      the property of the city, adjacent to the holy allotment and the property of
      the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east,
      and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the
      east border. '
    8: "⁸ This shall be his land as a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no\
      \ longer oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the\
      \ house of Israel according to their tribes.” \n"
    9: "⁹ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Enough, you princes of Israel; get rid\
      \ of violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Revoke\
      \ your evictions of My people,” declares the Lord God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “You shall have accurate balances, an accurate ephah, and an accurate
      bath. '
    11: '¹¹ The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity, so that the bath will
      contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their standard

    13: '¹³ “This is the offering that you shall offer: a sixth of an ephah from each
      homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley; '
    14: '¹⁴ and the prescribed portion of oil (namely, the bath of oil), a tenth of
      a bath from each kor (which is ten baths or a homer, for ten baths are a homer); '

      of Israel—for a grain offering, for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings,
      to make atonement for them,” declares the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ “All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince
      in Israel. '

    19: '¹⁹ And the priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and
      put it on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the

    20: "²⁰ And you shall do this on the seventh day of the month for everyone who\

    21: '²¹ “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have
      the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. '
    22: '²² On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of
      the land a bull as a sin offering. '
    23: '²³ And during the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering
      to the Lord seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven
      days, and a male goat daily as a sin offering. '
    24: '²⁴ And he shall provide as a grain offering an ephah with a bull, an ephah
      with a ram, and a hin of oil with an ephah. '
    25: ²⁵ In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast,
      he shall provide like these, seven days for the sin offering, the burnt offering,

  46:
    1: '¹ ‘This is what the Lord God says: “The gate of the inner courtyard facing
      east shall be shut for the six working days; but it shall be opened on the Sabbath

    3: '³ The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before
      the Lord on the Sabbaths and on the new moons. '
    4: '⁴ The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the Lord on the Sabbath
      day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; '
    5: '⁵ and the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering
      with the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah. '
    6: '⁶ On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull without blemish, and six
      lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish. '
    7: '⁷ And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah
      with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with
      an ephah. '
    8: '⁸ When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate,

    9: '⁹ But when the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed feasts,

    12: "¹² And when the prince provides a voluntary offering, a burnt offering, or\

    13: '¹³ “And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering

    19: '¹⁹ Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the
      gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold,
      a place was there at the extreme rear toward the west. '
    20: "²⁰ And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the\

    21: '²¹ Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me across to the

      them, and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around. '
    24: ²⁴ Then he said to me, “These are the cooking places where the ministers of
      the house shall cook the sacrifices of the people.”
  47:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was
      flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house
      faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of
      the house, from south of the altar. '
    2: "² And he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the\
      \ outside to the outer gate, by the way facing east. And behold, water was spurting\
      \ out from the south side. \n"
    3: '³ When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured
      a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles. '
    4: '⁴ Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching
      the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water
      reaching the hips. '
    5: '⁵ Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not wade across,
      because the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not
      be crossed by wading. '
    6: '⁶ And he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me
      back to the bank of the river. '
    7: '⁷ Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river there were very
      many trees on the one side and on the other. '
    8: '⁸ Then he said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and go
      down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the
      sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh. '
    9: '⁹ And it will come about that every living creature which swarms in every
      place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for
      these waters go there and the others become fresh; so everything will live where
      the river goes. '
    10: '¹⁰ And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi
      to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will
      be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many. '
    11: '¹¹ But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for
      salt. '
    12: "¹² And by the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow\
      \ all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit\
      \ will not fail. They will bear fruit every month because their water flows\
      \ from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for\
      \ healing.” \n"
    13: '¹³ This is what the Lord God says: “This shall be the boundary by which you
      shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel;
      Joseph shall have two portions. '
    14: "¹⁴ And you shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the\
      \ other; for I swore to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall fall\
      \ to you as an inheritance. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “And this shall be the boundary of the land: on the north side, from the
      Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad; '
    16: '¹⁶ Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and
      the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. '
    17: "¹⁷ The boundary shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enan at the border of\
      \ Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This\
      \ is the north side. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead, and the land of\
      \ Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the eastern sea you\
      \ shall measure. This is the east side. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “The south side toward the south shall extend from Tamar as far as the\
      \ waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea. This\
      \ is the south side toward the south. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the south border to a\
      \ point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side. \n"
    21: '²¹ “So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes
      of Israel. '
    22: '²² You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among
      the strangers who stay in your midst, who bring forth sons in your midst. And
      they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel; they shall
      be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. '
    23: ²³ And in the tribe with which the stranger resides, there you shall give
      him his inheritance,” declares the Lord God.
  48:
    1: '¹ “Now these are the names of the tribes: from the northern extremity, beside
      the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus,
      toward the north beside Hamath, running from east to west, Dan, one portion. '
    2: '² Beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one
      portion. '
    3: '³ Beside the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side, Naphtali,
      one portion. '
    4: '⁴ Beside the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh,

    5: '⁵ Beside the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim,

    6: '⁶ Beside the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side, Reuben,
      one portion. '
    7: "⁷ Beside the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah,\
      \ one portion. \n"
    8: '⁸ “And beside the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall
      be the allotment which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand cubits in width,
      and in length like one of the portions, from the east side to the west side;
      and the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it. '
    9: "⁹ The allotment that you shall set apart to the Lord shall be twenty-five\
      \ thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The holy allotment shall be for these, namely for the priests, toward
      the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, toward the west ten thousand
      in width, toward the east ten thousand in width, and toward the south twenty-five
      thousand in length; and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in its midst. '
    11: '¹¹ It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who
      have taken the responsibility I gave them, who did not go astray when the sons
      of Israel went astray as the Levites went astray. '
    12: '¹² It shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most
      holy reserve, by the border of the Levites. '
    13: '¹³ And alongside the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five
      thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width. The entire length shall
      be twenty-five thousand cubits and the width ten thousand. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover, they shall not sell or exchange any of it, or allow this choice\
      \ portion of land to pass to others; for it is holy to the Lord. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “The remainder, five thousand cubits in width and twenty-five thousand
      in length, shall be for common use for the city, for homes and for open spaces;
      and the city shall be in its midst. '
    16: '¹⁶ And these shall be its measurements: the north side, 4,500 cubits, the
      south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side, 4,500
      cubits. '
    17: '¹⁷ The city shall have open spaces: on the north 250 cubits, on the south
      250 cubits, on the east 250 cubits, and on the west 250 cubits. '
    18: '¹⁸ The remainder of the length alongside the holy allotment shall be ten
      thousand cubits toward the east and ten thousand toward the west; and it shall
      be alongside the holy allotment. And its produce shall be food for the workers
      of the city. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the workers of the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate
      it. '
    20: "²⁰ The whole allotment shall be twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand\
      \ cubits; you shall set apart the holy allotment, a square, with the property\
      \ of the city. \n"
    21: '²¹ “The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other
      of the holy allotment and of the property of the city; in front of the twenty-five
      thousand cubits of the allotment toward the east border and westward in front
      of the twenty-five thousand toward the west border, alongside the portions,
      it shall be for the prince. And the holy allotment and the sanctuary of the
      house shall be in the middle of it. '
    22: "²² And exclusive of the property of the Levites and the property of the city,\
      \ which are in the middle of that which belongs to the prince, everything between\
      \ the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin,

    28: '²⁸ And beside the border of Gad, at the south side toward the south, the
      border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook of
      Egypt, to the Great Sea. '
    29: "²⁹ This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel\
      \ for an inheritance, and these are their several portions,” declares the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Now these are the exits of the city: on the north side, 4,500 cubits
      by measurement, '
    31: '³¹ shall be the gates of the city, named for the tribes of Israel, three
      gates toward the north: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; and
      the gate of Levi, one. '
    32: '³² On the east side, 4,500 cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Joseph,
      one; the gate of Benjamin, one; and the gate of Dan, one. '
    33: '³³ On the south side, 4,500 cubits by measurement, shall be three gates:

      one. '
    34: '³⁴ On the west side, 4,500 cubits, shall be three gates: the gate of Gad,

    35: ³⁵ The city shall be eighteen thousand cubits all around; and the name of
      the city from that day shall be, ‘The Lord is there.’”
