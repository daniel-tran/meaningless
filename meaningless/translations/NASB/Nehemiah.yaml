Nehemiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.\nNow it happened in the month\
      \ Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol, "
    2: '² that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked
      them about the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about
      Jerusalem. '
    3: "³ And they said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the\
      \ captivity are in great distress and disgrace, and the wall of Jerusalem is\
      \ broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Now when I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days;
      and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. '
    5: '⁵ I said, “Please, Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps
      the covenant and faithfulness for those who love Him and keep His commandments: '
    6: '⁶ let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open, to hear the prayer of
      Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of
      the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel
      which we have committed against You; I and my father’s house have sinned. '
    7: '⁷ We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments,
      nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. '
    8: '⁸ Remember, please, the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying,
      ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples; '
    9: '⁹ but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those
      of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens,
      I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I have chosen
      to have My name dwell.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great
      power and by Your strong hand. '
    11: "¹¹ Please, Lord, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant\
      \ and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and please\
      \ make Your servant successful today and grant him mercy before this man.”\n\
      Now I was the cupbearer to the king."
  2:
    1: '¹ And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,
      that wine was before him, and I picked up the wine and gave it to the king.
      Now I had not been sad in his presence. '
    2: '² So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, though you are not ill? This
      is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid. '
    3: '³ And I said to the king, “May the king live forever. Why should my face not
      be sad when the city, the site of my fathers’ tombs, is desolate and its gates
      have been consumed by fire?” '
    4: '⁴ Then the king said to me, “What would you request?” So I prayed to the God
      of heaven. '
    5: '⁵ Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has
      found favor before you, I request that you send me to Judah, to the city of
      my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.” '
    6: '⁶ Then the king said to me, with the queen sitting beside him, “How long will
      your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me,
      and I gave him a definite time. '
    7: '⁷ And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me
      for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, so that they will allow
      me to pass through until I come to Judah, '
    8: "⁸ and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give\
      \ me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which is by the temple,\
      \ for the wall of the city, and for the house to which I will go.” And the king\
      \ granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the Euphrates River
      and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of
      the army and horsemen. '
    10: "¹⁰ And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard\
      \ about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the\
      \ welfare of the sons of Israel. \n"
    11: '¹¹ So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. '
    12: '¹² And I got up in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone
      what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal
      with me except the animal on which I was riding. '
    13: '¹³ So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s
      Spring and on to the Dung Gate, and I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem
      which were broken down and its gates which had been consumed by fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was
      no place for my mount to pass. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I was going up at night by the ravine and inspecting the wall. Then
      I entered the Valley Gate again and returned. '
    16: "¹⁶ However, the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing;\
      \ nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or\
      \ the rest who were doing the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem
      is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire. Come, let’s rebuild the
      wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a disgrace.” '
    18: '¹⁸ And I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also
      about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let’s arise
      and build.” So they put their hands to the good work. '
    19: '¹⁹ But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and
      Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked us and despised us, and said, “What
      is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” '
    20: ²⁰ So I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will make us successful;
      therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no part, right,
      or memorial in Jerusalem.”
  3:
    1: '¹ Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built
      the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and installed its doors. They consecrated
      the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. '
    2: "² And next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son\
      \ of Imri built. \n"
    3: '³ Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and installed
      its doors with its bolts and bars. '
    4: '⁴ Next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz made repairs. And
      next to him Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel made repairs.
      And next to him Zadok the son of Baana also made repairs. '
    5: "⁵ Moreover, next to him the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not\
      \ support the work of their masters. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired
      the Ancient Gate; they laid its beams and installed its doors with its bolts
      and its bars. '
    7: '⁷ Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of
      Gibeon and of Mizpah, also made repairs for the official seat of the governor
      of the province beyond the Euphrates River. '
    8: '⁸ Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah of the goldsmiths made repairs. And
      next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they restored
      Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. '
    9: '⁹ And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, the official of half the district
      of Jerusalem, made repairs. '
    10: '¹⁰ Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house.
      And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs. '
    11: '¹¹ Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired
      another section and the Tower of Furnaces. '
    12: "¹² Next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the official of half the district\
      \ of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built\
      \ it and installed its doors with its bolts and its bars, and a thousand cubits\
      \ of the wall to the Dung Gate. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Malchijah the son of Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccherem\
      \ repaired the Dung Gate. He built it and installed its doors with its bolts\
      \ and its bars. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, the official of the district of Mizpah,
      repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, made a roof for it, and installed its
      doors with its bolts and its bars, and the wall of the Pool of Shelah at the
      king’s garden as far as the steps that descend from the city of David. '
    16: '¹⁶ After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, official of half the district of
      Beth-zur, made repairs as far as a point opposite the tombs of David, and as
      far as the artificial pool and the house of the mighty men. '
    17: '¹⁷ After him the Levites carried out repairs under Rehum the son of Bani.
      Next to him Hashabiah, the official of half the district of Keilah, carried
      out repairs for his district. '
    18: '¹⁸ After him their brothers carried out repairs under Bavvai the son of Henadad,
      official of the other half of the district of Keilah. '
    19: '¹⁹ And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the official of Mizpah, repaired
      another section in front of the ascent of the armory at the Angle. '
    20: '²⁰ After him Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section,
      from the Angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest. '
    21: '²¹ After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another
      section, from the doorway of Eliashib’s house even as far as the end of his
      house. '
    22: '²² And after him the priests, the men of the vicinity, carried out repairs. '
    23: '²³ After them Benjamin and Hasshub carried out repairs in front of their
      house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, carried out repairs
      beside his house. '
    24: '²⁴ After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the
      house of Azariah as far as the Angle and as far as the corner. '
    25: '²⁵ Palal the son of Uzai made repairs in front of the Angle and the tower
      projecting from the upper house of the king, which is by the courtyard of the
      guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the temple servants living in Ophel made repairs as far as the front
      of the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. '
    27: "²⁷ After them the Tekoites repaired another section in front of the great\
      \ projecting tower and as far as the wall of Ophel. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Above the Horse Gate the priests carried out repairs, each in front of
      his house. '
    29: '²⁹ After them Zadok the son of Immer carried out repairs in front of his
      house. And after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate,
      carried out repairs. '
    30: '³⁰ After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph,
      repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah carried out
      repairs in front of his own quarters. '
    31: '³¹ After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, carried out repairs as far
      as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, in front of the Inspection
      Gate and as far as the upper room of the corner. '
    32: ³² And between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths
      and the merchants carried out repairs.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the
      wall, he became furious and very angry, and he mocked the Jews. '
    2: '² And he spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy people of Samaria
      and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore the temple
      for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can
      they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble, even the burned ones?” '
    3: "³ Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him, and he said, “Even what they are building—if\
      \ a fox were to jump on it, it would break their stone wall down!” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear, O our God, how we are an object of contempt! Return their taunting
      on their own heads, and turn them into plunder in a land of captivity. '
    5: "⁵ Do not forgive their guilt and do not let their sin be wiped out before\
      \ You, for they have demoralized the builders. \n"
    6: "⁶ So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together to half its\
      \ height, for the people had a mind to work. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites
      heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches
      began to be closed, they were very angry. '
    8: "⁸ So all of them conspired together to come to fight against Jerusalem and\
      \ to cause confusion in it. \n"
    9: "⁹ But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against\
      \ them day and night. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And so in Judah it was said:\n“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,\n\
      Yet there is much rubble;\nAnd we ourselves are unable\nTo rebuild the wall.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ And our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them,
      kill them, and put a stop to the work.” '
    12: '¹² When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will
      come up against us from every place where you may turn,” '
    13: '¹³ then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall,
      the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords,
      spears, and bows. '
    14: "¹⁴ When I saw their fear, I stood and said to the nobles, the officials,\
      \ and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who\
      \ is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters,\
      \ your wives, and your houses.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated
      their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work. '
    16: '¹⁶ And from that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half
      of them kept hold of the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail;
      and the captains were behind all the house of Judah. '
    17: '¹⁷ Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens carried
      with one hand doing the work, and the other keeping hold of a weapon. '
    18: '¹⁸ As for the builders, each wore his sword strapped to his waist as he built,
      while the trumpeter stood near me. '
    19: '¹⁹ And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The
      work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another. '
    20: "²⁰ At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, assemble to us there.\
      \ Our God will fight for us.” \n"
    21: '²¹ So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until
      the stars appeared. '
    22: '²² At that time I also said to the people, “Each man with his servant shall
      spend the night within Jerusalem, so that they may be a guard for us by night
      and a laborer by day.” '
    23: ²³ So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed
      me—none of us removed our clothes; each took his weapon even to the water.
  5:
    1: '¹ Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their
      Jewish brothers. '
    2: '² For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many;
      therefore let’s get grain so that we may eat and live.” '
    3: '³ And there were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards,
      and our houses so that we might get grain because of the famine.” '
    4: '⁴ There also were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax
      on our fields and our vineyards. '
    5: "⁵ And now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their\
      \ children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves,\
      \ and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless\
      \ because our fields and vineyards belong to others.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. '
    7: '⁷ So I thought it over and contended with the nobles and the leading people,
      and said to them, “You are lending at interest, each to his brother!” Therefore,
      I held a great assembly against them. '
    8: '⁸ And I said to them, “We, according to our ability, have redeemed our Jewish
      brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers
      that they may be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a word
      to say. '
    9: '⁹ So I said, “The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk
      in the fear of our God because of the taunting of the nations, our enemies? '
    10: '¹⁰ And likewise I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and
      grain. Please, let’s do without this interest. '
    11: '¹¹ Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards,
      their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth part of the money
      and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are charging as interest
      from them.” '
    12: '¹² Then they said, “We will give it back and will require nothing from them;
      we will do exactly as you say.” So I called the priests and made them take an
      oath to act in accordance with this promise. '
    13: "¹³ I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “So may God shake out\
      \ every person from his house and from his possessions who does not keep this\
      \ promise; just so may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said,\
      \ “Amen!” And they praised the Lord. Then the people acted in accordance with\
      \ this promise. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Furthermore, since the day that I was appointed to be their governor in
      the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King
      Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor’s
      food allowance. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the previous governors who were before me laid burdens on the people
      and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their
      servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of my fear of God. '
    16: '¹⁶ I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land,
      and all my servants were gathered there for the work. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover, there were at my table 150 Jews and officials, besides those
      who came to us from the nations that were around us. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep;
      also birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all sorts of wine were provided
      in abundance. Yet for all this I did not request the governor’s food allowance,
      because the forced labor was heavy on this people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Remember me, my God, for good, in return for all that I have done for this
      people.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the
      rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach was left
      in it, although at that time I had not installed the doors in the gates, '
    2: '² Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, “Come, let’s meet together
      at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they were plotting to harm me. '
    3: '³ So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and am unable
      to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” '
    4: '⁴ Then they sent messages to me four times worded in this way, and I answered
      them with the same wording. '
    5: '⁵ Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way a fifth time with
      an open letter in his hand. '
    6: '⁶ In it was written: “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that
      you and the Jews intend to rebel; for that reason you are rebuilding the wall.
      And you are to be their king, according to these reports. '
    7: '⁷ You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you,
      ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these
      reports. So come now, let’s consult together.” '
    8: '⁸ Then I sent a message to him saying, “Nothing like these things that you
      are saying has been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind.” '
    9: "⁹ For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, “They will become\
      \ discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, God, strengthen\
      \ my hands. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel,
      who was confined at home, he said, “Let’s meet together in the house of God,
      within the temple, and let’s close the doors of the temple, for they are coming
      to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.” '
    11: '¹¹ But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And who is there like me who would
      go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go in.” '
    12: '¹² Then I realized that God certainly had not sent him, but he uttered his
      prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. '
    13: '¹³ He was hired for this reason, that I would become frightened and act accordingly
      and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could taunt
      me. '
    14: "¹⁴ Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in accordance with these works\
      \ of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets, who\
      \ were trying to frighten me. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two
      days. '
    16: '¹⁶ When all our enemies heard about it, and all the nations surrounding us
      saw it, they lost their confidence; for they realized that this work had been
      accomplished with the help of our God. '
    17: '¹⁷ Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah,
      and Tobiah’s letters came to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law
      of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter
      of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. '
    19: ¹⁹ Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence, and were
      reporting my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
  7:
    1: '¹ Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had installed the doors, and the gatekeepers,
      the singers, and the Levites were appointed, '
    2: '² then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the citadel,
      in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. '
    3: '³ Then I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until
      the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, the gatekeepers are to keep
      the doors shut and bolted. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
      each at his post, and each in front of his own house.” '
    4: "⁴ Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the\
      \ houses were not built. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials,\
      \ and the other people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book\
      \ of the genealogy of those who came up first, in which I found the following\
      \ record: \n"
    6: '⁶ These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the
      exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had taken into exile, and who

    5: '⁵ Then Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing
      above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. '
    6: '⁶ Then Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the people answered,
      “Amen, Amen!” with the raising of their hands; then they kneeled down and worshiped
      the Lord with their faces to the ground. '
    7: '⁷ Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah,

    8: "⁸ They read from the book, from the Law of God, translating to give the sense\

    9: '⁹ Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and
      the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy
      to the Lord your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping
      when they heard the words of the Law. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he said to them, “Go, eat the festival foods, drink the sweet drinks,
      and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our
      Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your refuge.” '
    11: '¹¹ So the Levites silenced all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day
      is holy; do not be grieved.” '
    12: "¹² Then all the people went away to eat, drink, to send portions, and to\
      \ celebrate a great feast, because they understood the words which had been\

    13: '¹³ Then on the second day the heads of fathers’ households of all the people,
      the priests, and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe so that they might
      gain insight into the words of the Law. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they found written in the Law how the Lord had commanded through Moses
      that the sons of Israel were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh
      month. '
    15: '¹⁵ And that they were to proclaim and circulate a proclamation in all their
      cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches
      and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of other
      trees with thick branches, to make booths, as it is written.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves,
      each on his roof, and in their courtyards and in the courtyards of the house
      of God, and in the public square at the Water Gate, and in the square at the
      Gate of Ephraim. '
    17: '¹⁷ The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made
      booths and lived in the booths. Indeed, the sons of Israel had not done so since
      the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was very great rejoicing. '
    18: ¹⁸ He read from the Book of the Law of God daily, from the first day to the
      last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there
      was a festive assembly in accordance with the ordinance.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled
      with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them. '
    2: '² The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and
      they stood and confessed their sins and the wrongdoings of their fathers. '
    3: '³ While they stood in their place, they read from the Book of the Law of the
      Lord their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed
      and worshiped the Lord their God. '
    4: "⁴ Now on the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni,\
      \ Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and they cried out with a loud voice to the\
      \ Lord their God. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah,\
      \ Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, “Arise, bless the Lord your God forever and\

    9: "⁹ “You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,\nAnd heard their cry by\

    10: "¹⁰ Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,\nAgainst all his\

    11: "¹¹ You divided the sea before them,\nSo they passed through the midst of\
      \ the sea on dry ground;\nAnd You hurled their pursuers into the depths,\nLike\
      \ a stone into raging waters.\n"
    12: "¹² And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,\nAnd with a pillar of\
      \ fire by night\nTo light for them the way\nIn which they were to go.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then You came down on Mount Sinai,\nAnd spoke with them from heaven;\n\
      You gave them just ordinances and true laws,\nGood statutes and commandments.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,\nAnd gave them commandments,\
      \ statutes, and law,\nThrough Your servant Moses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger,\nYou brought\
      \ out water from a rock for them for their thirst,\nAnd You told them to enter\
      \ in order to take possession of\nThe land which You swore to give them. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;\nThey became stubborn and would\
      \ not listen to Your commandments.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They refused to listen,\nAnd did not remember Your wondrous deeds which\
      \ You performed among them;\nSo they became stubborn and appointed a leader\
      \ to return to their slavery in Egypt.\nBut You are a God of forgiveness,\n\
      Gracious and compassionate,\nSlow to anger and abounding in mercy;\nAnd You\
      \ did not abandon them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Even when they made for themselves\nA calf of cast metal\nAnd said, ‘This\
      \ is your god\nWho brought you up from Egypt,’\nAnd committed great blasphemies,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ You, in Your great compassion,\nDid not abandon them in the wilderness;\n\
      The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day,\nTo guide them on their way,\n\
      Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were\
      \ to go.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Instead, You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,\nYou did not withhold\
      \ Your manna from their mouth,\nAnd You gave them water for their thirst.\n"
    21: "²¹ Indeed, for forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they\
      \ were not lacking;\nTheir clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell\
      \ up.\n"
    22: "²² You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,\nAnd allotted them to them as\
      \ a boundary.\nThey took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon\n\
      And the land of Og the king of Bashan.\n"
    23: "²³ You made their sons as numerous as the stars of heaven,\nAnd You brought\
      \ them into the land\nWhich You had told their fathers to enter and possess.\n"
    24: "²⁴ So their sons entered and took possession of the land.\nAnd You subdued\
      \ before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,\nAnd You handed them\
      \ over to them, with their kings and the peoples of the land,\nTo do with them\
      \ as they desired.\n"
    25: "²⁵ They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.\nThey took possession\
      \ of houses full of every good thing,\nCarved out cisterns, vineyards, olive\
      \ groves,\nFruit trees in abundance.\nSo they ate, were filled and put on fat,\n\
      And lived luxuriously in Your great goodness. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “But they became rebellious and revolted against You,\nAnd threw Your\
      \ Law behind their backs\nAnd killed Your prophets who had admonished them\n\
      In order to bring them back to You,\nAnd they committed great blasphemies.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore You handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them,\n\
      But when they cried out to You in the time of their distress,\nYou heard from\
      \ heaven, and according to Your great compassion\nYou gave them people who saved\

    28: "²⁸ But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You;\nTherefore\
      \ You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.\n\
      When they cried out again to You, You heard from heaven,\nAnd many times You\
      \ rescued them according to Your compassion,\n"
    29: "²⁹ And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your Law.\nYet they\
      \ acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against\
      \ Your ordinances,\nWhich, if a person follows them, then he will live by them.\n\
      And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not\
      \ listen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ However, You remained patient with them for many years,\nAnd admonished\
      \ them by Your Spirit through Your prophets,\nYet they would not listen.\nTherefore\
      \ You handed them over to the peoples of the lands.\n"
    31: "³¹ Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them\
      \ or abandon them,\nFor You are a gracious and compassionate God. \n"
    32: "³² “Now then, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps\
      \ His covenant and faithfulness,\nDo not let all the hardship seem insignificant\
      \ before You,\nWhich has happened to us, our kings, our leaders, our priests,\

    36: "³⁶ Behold, we are slaves today,\nAnd as for the land which You gave to our\
      \ fathers to eat its fruit and its bounty,\nBehold, we are slaves on it.\n"
    37: "³⁷ And its abundant produce is for the kings\nWhom You have set over us because\

      are there. So we will not neglect the house of our God.

    1: '¹ Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people
      cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while
      nine-tenths remained in the other cities. '
    2: "² And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in
      the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities—the Israelites,
      the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon’s
      servants. '
    4: '⁴ Some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.
      From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the
      son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of
      Perez; '
    5: '⁵ and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah,
      the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the
      Shilonite. '
    6: "⁶ All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were 468 able men. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son
      of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son
      of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah; '
    8: '⁸ and after him Gabbai and Sallai, 928. '
    9: "⁹ Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah\
      \ was second in command of the city. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ From the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, '
    11: '¹¹ Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the
      son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the overseer of the house of God, '
    12: '¹² and their kinsmen who did the work of the temple, 822; and Adaiah the
      son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah,
      the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, '
    13: '¹³ and his kinsmen, heads of fathers’ households, 242; and Amashsai the son
      of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, '
    14: "¹⁴ and their brothers, valiant warriors, 128. And their overseer was Zabdiel,\
      \ the son of Haggedolim. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam,
      the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; '
    16: '¹⁶ and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who were
      in charge of the outside work of the house of God; '
    17: '¹⁷ and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who
      was the leader in beginning the thanksgiving at prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second
      among his kinsmen; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of
      Jeduthun. '
    18: "¹⁸ All the Levites in the holy city were 284. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Also the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their kinsmen who kept watch\
      \ at the gates, were 172. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The rest of Israel, of the priests and of the Levites, were in all the
      cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance. '
    21: "²¹ But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were\
      \ in charge of the temple servants. \n"
    22: '²² Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani,
      the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of
      Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God. '
    23: '²³ For there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a royal
      command for the singers day by day. '
    24: "²⁴ And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah,\
      \ was the king’s representative for every matter concerning the people. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived
      in Kiriath-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and
      its villages, '
    26: '²⁶ and in Jeshua, in Moladah, and Beth-pelet, '
    27: '²⁷ and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns, '
    28: '²⁸ and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns, '
    29: '²⁹ and in En-rimmon, in Zorah, and in Jarmuth, '
    30: '³⁰ Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and
      its towns. So they camped from Beersheba as far as the Valley of Hinnom. '
    31: '³¹ The sons of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija,
      at Bethel and its towns, '
    32: '³² at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, '
    33: '³³ Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, '
    34: '³⁴ Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, '
    35: '³⁵ Lod, and Ono, the Valley of Craftsmen. '
    36: ³⁶ And from the Levites, some divisions in Judah belonged to Benjamin.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the
      son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, '
    2: '² Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, '
    3: '³ Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, '
    4: '⁴ Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, '
    5: '⁵ Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, '
    6: '⁶ Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah, '
    7: "⁷ Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and\
      \ their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua. \n"
    8: '⁸ And the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah
      who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brothers. '
    9: '⁹ Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in their service
      divisions. '
    10: '¹⁰ Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered
      Joiada, '
    11: "¹¹ Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua. \n"
    12: '¹² Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers’ households
      were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; '
    13: '¹³ of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; '
    14: '¹⁴ of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; '
    15: '¹⁵ of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; '
    16: '¹⁶ of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; '
    17: '¹⁷ of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; '
    18: '¹⁸ of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; '
    19: '¹⁹ of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; '
    20: '²⁰ of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; '
    21: "²¹ of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel. \n"
    22: '²² As for the Levites, the heads of fathers’ households were registered in
      the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua; so were the priests in
      the reign of Darius the Persian. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers’ households, were registered in
      the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. '
    24: '²⁴ And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the
      son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks,
      as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division. '
    25: '²⁵ Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers
      keeping watch at the storerooms of the gates. '
    26: "²⁶ These men served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of\
      \ Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and\
      \ scribe. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites
      from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they could celebrate
      the dedication with joy, with songs of thanksgiving and with songs to the accompaniment
      of cymbals, harps, and lyres. '
    28: '²⁸ So the sons of the singers were assembled from the territory around Jerusalem,
      and from the villages of the Netophathites, '
    29: '²⁹ from Beth-gilgal and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, because the
      singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem. '
    30: "³⁰ The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the\
      \ people, the gates, and the wall. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed
      two large choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward
      the Dung Gate. '
    32: '³² Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, '
    33: '³³ with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, '
    34: '³⁴ Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, '
    35: '³⁵ and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; and Zechariah the son
      of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah,
      the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, '
    36: '³⁶ and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah,
      and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the
      scribe went before them. '
    37: "³⁷ At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David\
      \ by the stairway of the wall, above the house of David to the Water Gate on\
      \ the east. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half
      of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall, '
    39: '³⁹ and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Ancient Gate, by the Fish Gate,
      the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate;
      and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Then the two choirs took their positions in the house of God. So did I
      and half of the officials with me; '
    41: '⁴¹ and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
      and Hananiah, with the trumpets; '
    42: '⁴² and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and
      Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader, '
    43: "⁴³ and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God\
      \ had given them great joy, and the women and children rejoiced as well, so\
      \ that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the supplies,
      the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from
      the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and
      Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who served. '
    45: '⁴⁵ For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification,
      together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command
      of David and of his son Solomon. '
    46: '⁴⁶ For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders
      of the singers, songs of praise and songs of thanksgiving to God. '
    47: ⁴⁷ So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions
      due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and they set apart
      the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated
      portion for the sons of Aaron.
  13:
    1: '¹ On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud as the people listened; and
      there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite was ever to enter
      the assembly of God, '
    2: '² because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired
      Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a
      blessing. '
    3: "³ So when they heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers
      of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah, '
    5: '⁵ had prepared a large room for him, where previously they used to put the
      grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine,
      and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the
      contributions for the priests. '
    6: '⁶ But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second
      year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had come to the king. After some time,
      however, I requested a leave of absence from the king, '
    7: '⁷ and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had committed
      for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of God. '
    8: '⁸ It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household articles
      out of the room. '
    9: "⁹ Then I gave an order, and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned the utensils\
      \ of the house of God there with the grain offering and the frankincense. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given
      to them, so the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away,
      each to his own field. '
    11: '¹¹ So I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why has the house of God been
      neglected?” Then I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts. '
    12: '¹² All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the
      storehouses. '
    13: '¹³ To be in charge of the storehouses, I appointed Shelemiah the priest,
      Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites, and in addition to them was
      Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable,
      and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen. '
    14: "¹⁴ Remember me for this, my God, and do not wipe out my loyal deeds which\
      \ I have performed for the house of my God and its services. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In those days I saw in Judah people who were treading wine presses on
      the Sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as
      well as wine, grapes, figs, and every kind of load, and they were bringing them
      into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I admonished them on the day they sold
      food. '
    16: '¹⁶ Also people of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds
      of merchandise, and sold them to the sons of Judah on the Sabbath, even in Jerusalem. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this
      evil thing that you are doing, by profaning the Sabbath day? '
    18: "¹⁸ Did your fathers not do the same, so that our God brought on us and on\
      \ this city all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath against Israel\
      \ by profaning the Sabbath.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And it came about that just as it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem
      before the Sabbath, I ordered that the doors be shut, and that they were not
      to open them until after the Sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at
      the gates so that no load would enter on the Sabbath day. '
    20: '²⁰ Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent
      the night outside Jerusalem. '
    21: '²¹ Then I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front
      of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you.” From that time
      on they did not come on the Sabbath. '
    22: "²² And I ordered the Levites that they were to purify themselves and come\
      \ as gatekeepers to sanctify the Sabbath day. For this also remember me, my\
      \ God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your mercy. \n"
    23: '²³ In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod,
      Ammon, and Moab. '
    24: '²⁴ As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none
      of them knew how to speak the language of Judah, but only the language of his
      own people. '
    25: '²⁵ So I quarreled with them and cursed them, and struck some of them and
      pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your
      daughters to their sons, nor take any of their daughters for your sons or for
      yourselves. '
    26: '²⁶ Did Solomon the king of Israel not sin regarding these things? Yet among
      the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and
      God made him king over all Israel; yet the foreign women caused even him to
      sin. '
    27: '²⁷ Has it not then been reported about you that you have committed all this
      great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God, by marrying foreign women?” '
    28: '²⁸ Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, became
      a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I chased him away from me. '
    29: "²⁹ Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the\
      \ covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. \n"
    30: '³⁰ So I purified them from everything foreign, and assigned duties to the
      priests and the Levites, each in his work, '
    31: ³¹ and I arranged for the delivery of wood at appointed times and for the
      first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.
