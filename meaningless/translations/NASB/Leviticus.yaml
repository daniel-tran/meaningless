Leviticus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting,
      saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When anyone of you brings
      an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of livestock from the
      herd or the flock. '
    3: '³ If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male
      without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, so
      that he may be accepted before the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, so that it
      may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf. '
    5: '⁵ Then he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord; and Aaron’s sons the priests
      shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is
      at the doorway of the tent of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ He shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces. '
    7: '⁷ And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange
      wood on the fire. '
    8: '⁸ Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, with the head and
      the suet, on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. '
    9: "⁹ Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest\
      \ shall offer all of it up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering\
      \ by fire as a soothing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘But if his offering is from the flock, either from the sheep or from
      the goats, as a burnt offering, he shall offer a male without defect. '
    11: '¹¹ And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the
      Lord, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. '
    12: '¹² He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the
      priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. '
    13: "¹³ The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the\
      \ priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is\
      \ a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘But if his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then he
      shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young doves. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head, and offer
      it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side
      of the altar. '
    16: '¹⁶ He shall also remove its craw with its feathers and throw it beside the
      altar eastward, to the place of the fatty ashes. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest
      shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, on the wood which is on the fire; it
      is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ ‘Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the Lord, his
      offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense
      on it. '
    2: '² He shall then bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take from
      it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil, with all of its frankincense.
      And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar,
      an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord. '
    3: "³ The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a most\
      \ holy part of the offerings to the Lord by fire. \n"
    4: '⁴ ‘Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, it
      shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers
      spread with oil. '
    5: '⁵ And if your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it shall be
      of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil; '
    6: '⁶ you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. '
    7: '⁷ Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it shall be made
      of fine flour with oil. '
    8: '⁸ When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to the
      Lord, it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar. '
    9: '⁹ The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion,
      and shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing
      aroma to the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a most\
      \ holy part of the offerings to the Lord by fire. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘No grain offering, which you bring to the Lord, shall be made with leaven,
      for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by
      fire to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the Lord, but they
      shall not ascend as a soothing aroma on the altar. '
    13: "¹³ Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so\
      \ that the salt of the covenant of your God will not be lacking from your grain\
      \ offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the Lord,
      you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, crushed grain of new
      growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened produce. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall then put oil on it and place incense on it; it is a grain offering. '
    16: ¹⁶ Then the priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of its
      crushed grain and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the
      Lord.
  3:
    1: '¹ ‘Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to
      offer from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect
      before the Lord. '
    2: '² And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at
      the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle
      the blood around on the altar. '
    3: '³ From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall then present an offering
      by fire to the Lord, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is
      on the entrails, '
    4: '⁴ and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins,
      and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. '
    5: '⁵ Then Aaron’s sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering,
      which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a soothing
      aroma to the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ But if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord is from
      the flock, he shall offer it, male or female, without defect. '
    7: '⁷ If he is going to offer a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it
      before the Lord, '
    8: '⁸ and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it in
      front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood around
      on the altar. '
    9: '⁹ From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall then bring as an offering
      by fire to the Lord, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close
      to the backbone, the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is on
      the entrails, '
    10: '¹⁰ and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins,
      and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering\
      \ by fire to the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² ‘Now if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord, '
    13: '¹³ and he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the
      tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the
      altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ From it he shall present his offering as an offering by fire to the Lord,
      the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, '
    15: '¹⁵ and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins,
      and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. '
    16: '¹⁶ The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering
      by fire as a soothing aroma; all fat is the Lord’s. '
    17: '¹⁷ It is a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling
      places: you shall not eat any fat or any blood.’”'
  4:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a person sins unintentionally
      in any of the things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and commits
      any of them, '
    3: '³ if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then he
      is to offer to the Lord a bull without defect as a sin offering for his sin
      which he has committed. '
    4: '⁴ He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the tent of meeting before the
      Lord, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull
      before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ Then the anointed priest is to take some of the blood of the bull and bring
      it to the tent of meeting, '
    6: '⁶ and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the
      blood seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of
      fragrant incense which is before the Lord in the tent of meeting; and all the
      rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of
      burnt offering, which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. '
    8: '⁸ And he shall remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering:
      the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails, '
    9: '⁹ and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins,
      and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys '
    10: '¹⁰ (just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings);
      and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering. '
    11: '¹¹ But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, along with its head, its legs,
      its entrails, and its refuse, '
    12: "¹² that is, all the rest of the bull, he is to bring out to a clean place\
      \ outside the camp where the fatty ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood\
      \ with fire; where the fatty ashes are poured out it shall be burned. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Now if the entire congregation of Israel does wrong unintentionally and
      the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things
      which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty; '
    14: '¹⁴ when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly
      shall offer a bull of the herd as a sin offering and bring it in front of the
      tent of meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head
      of the bull before the Lord, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to
      the tent of meeting; '
    17: '¹⁷ and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven
      times before the Lord, in front of the veil. '
    18: '¹⁸ He shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is
      before the Lord in the tent of meeting; and all the rest of the blood he shall
      pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway
      of the tent of meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ And he shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the
      altar. '
    20: '²⁰ He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin
      offering; he shall do the same with it. So the priest shall make atonement for
      them, and they will be forgiven. '
    21: "²¹ Then he is to bring the bull out to a place outside the camp and burn\
      \ it just as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² ‘When a leader sins and unintentionally does any of the things which the
      Lord his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty, '
    23: '²³ if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring
      as his offering a goat, a male without defect. '
    24: '²⁴ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slaughter it
      in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is
      a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with
      his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest
      of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. '
    26: "²⁶ And he shall offer all its fat up in smoke on the altar as in the case\
      \ of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So the priest shall make atonement\
      \ for him regarding his sin, and he will be forgiven. \n"
    27: '²⁷ ‘Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally by doing any
      of the things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty, '
    28: '²⁸ if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall
      bring as his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he
      has committed. '
    29: '²⁹ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter
      the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering. '
    30: '³⁰ The priest shall then take some of its blood with his finger and put it
      on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he
      shall pour out at the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the\
      \ sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on\
      \ the altar as a soothing aroma to the Lord. So the priest shall make atonement\
      \ for him, and he will be forgiven. \n"
    32: '³² ‘But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall
      bring a female without defect. '
    33: '³³ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter
      it as a sin offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering. '
    34: '³⁴ And the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his
      finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest
      of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed
      from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer it up
      in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the Lord. So the priest shall
      make atonement for him regarding his sin which he has committed, and he will
      be forgiven.
  5:
    1: '¹ ‘Now if a person sins after he hears a public order to testify when he is
      a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he does not tell it, then
      he will bear his punishment. '
    2: '² Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean
      animal, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or a carcass of unclean swarming things,
      though it is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty. '
    3: '³ Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort his uncleanness may
      be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes
      to know it, he will be guilty. '
    4: '⁴ Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good,
      in whatever matter people speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is hidden
      from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty of one of these things. '
    5: '⁵ So it shall be when he becomes guilty of one of these things, that he shall
      confess that in which he has sinned. '
    6: "⁶ He shall also bring his guilt offering to the Lord for his sin which he\
      \ has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering.\
      \ So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin. \n"
    7: '⁷ ‘But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the Lord his guilt
      offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young doves,
      one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. '
    8: '⁸ He shall bring them to the priest, who shall first offer that which is for
      the sin offering, and shall pinch off its head at the front of its neck, but
      he shall not sever it. '
    9: '⁹ He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side
      of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of
      the altar: it is a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering according to the\
      \ ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which\
      \ he has committed, and it will be forgiven him. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young doves,
      then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth
      of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it or place
      incense on it, for it is a sin offering. '
    12: '¹² He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful
      of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the
      offerings of the Lord by fire: it is a sin offering. '
    13: "¹³ So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he\
      \ has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest\
      \ shall become the priest’s, like the grain offering.’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    15: '¹⁵ “If a person acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against the Lord’s
      holy things, then he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord: a ram without
      defect from the flock, according to your assessment in silver by shekels, in
      terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, as a guilt offering. '
    16: "¹⁶ And he shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the\
      \ holy thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest.\
      \ The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering,\
      \ and it will be forgiven him. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Now if a person sins and does any of the things which the Lord has commanded
      not to be done, though he was unaware, he is still guilty and shall bear his
      punishment. '
    18: '¹⁸ He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock,
      according to your assessment, as a guilt offering. So the priest shall make
      atonement for him concerning his sin which he committed unintentionally and
      did not know it, and it will be forgiven him. '
    19: ¹⁹ It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the Lord.”
  6:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the Lord, and disavows
      the rightful claim of his neighbor regarding a deposit or a security entrusted
      to him, or regarding robbery, or he has extorted from his neighbor, '
    3: '³ or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that
      he sins regarding any of the things that people do; '
    4: '⁴ then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall restore
      what he took by robbery or acquired by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted
      to him, or the lost property which he found, '
    5: '⁵ or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for
      it in full and add to it a fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it
      belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering. '
    6: '⁶ Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram
      without defect from the flock, according to your assessment, as a guilt offering, '
    7: "⁷ and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he will\
      \ be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law for the burnt offering:
      the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night
      until the morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it. '
    10: '¹⁰ The priest is to put on his linen robe, and he shall put on linen undergarments
      next to his body; and he shall take up the fatty ashes to which the fire reduces
      the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry
      the fatty ashes outside the camp to a clean place. '
    12: '¹² The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out,
      but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the
      burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings
      on it. '
    13: "¹³ Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present
      it before the Lord in front of the altar. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then one of them shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of
      the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering,
      and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial
      offering to the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ And Aaron and his sons are to eat what is left of it. It shall be eaten
      as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of
      the tent of meeting. '
    17: '¹⁷ It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from
      My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. '
    18: "¹⁸ Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a permanent ordinance\
      \ throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to the Lord. Whoever\
      \ touches them will become consecrated.’” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the Lord
      on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular
      grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. '
    21: '²¹ It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you
      shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing
      aroma to the Lord. '
    22: '²² The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer
      it. By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the
      Lord. '
    23: "²³ So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall\
      \ not be eaten.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering:
      in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall
      be slaughtered before the Lord; it is most holy. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a
      holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. '
    27: '²⁷ Whoever touches its flesh will become consecrated; and when any of its
      blood spatters on a garment, you shall wash what spattered on it in a holy place. '
    28: '²⁸ Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and
      if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in
      water. '
    29: '²⁹ Every male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy. '
    30: ³⁰ But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent
      of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place shall be eaten; it shall be burned
      with fire.
  7:
    1: '¹ ‘Now this is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy. '
    2: '² In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they are to slaughter
      the guilt offering, and the priest shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. '
    3: '³ Then he shall offer from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers
      the entrails, '
    4: '⁴ and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins;
      and he shall remove the lobe on the liver with the kidneys. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire
      to the Lord; it is a guilt offering. '
    6: '⁶ Every male among the priests may eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place;
      it is most holy. '
    7: '⁷ The guilt offering is like the sin offering: there is one law for them.
      The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. '
    8: '⁸ Also the priest who presents anyone’s burnt offering, that priest shall
      have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has presented. '
    9: '⁹ Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything
      prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it. '
    10: "¹⁰ Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons\
      \ of Aaron, to all alike. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be
      presented to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² If he offers it by way of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice
      of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened
      wafers spread with oil, and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil. '
    13: '¹³ With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present
      his offering with cakes of leavened bread. '
    14: "¹⁴ Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to the\
      \ Lord; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ ‘Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings,
      it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over
      until morning. '
    16: '¹⁶ But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering,
      it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day
      what is left of it may be eaten; '
    17: '¹⁷ but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
      shall be burned with fire. '
    18: "¹⁸ So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is ever\
      \ eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted, and it will\
      \ not be credited to him. It will be an unclean thing, and the person who eats\
      \ it shall bear his punishment. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ ‘Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall
      be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh. '
    20: '²⁰ But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings
      which belong to the Lord, when he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from
      his people. '
    21: "²¹ When anyone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an\
      \ unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of\
      \ the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the Lord, that person shall\
      \ be cut off from his people.’” \n"
    22: '²² Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    23: '²³ “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘You shall not eat any fat from
      an ox, a sheep, or a goat. '
    24: '²⁴ Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by
      animals may be put to any other use, but you certainly are not to eat it. '
    25: '²⁵ For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire
      is offered to the Lord, the person who eats it shall also be cut off from his
      people. '
    26: '²⁶ And you are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of
      your dwellings. '
    27: "²⁷ Any person who eats any blood, that person shall also be cut off from\
      \ his people.’” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    29: '²⁹ “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of
      his peace offerings to the Lord shall bring his offering to the Lord from the
      sacrifice of his peace offerings. '
    30: '³⁰ His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the Lord. He shall bring
      the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be presented as a wave offering
      before the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ And the priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast
      shall belong to Aaron and to his sons. '
    32: '³² And you shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from
      the sacrifices of your peace offerings. '
    33: '³³ The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings
      and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as his portion. '
    34: "³⁴ For I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering\
      \ and the thigh of the contribution from the sacrifices of their peace offerings,\
      \ and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their allotted\
      \ portion forever from the sons of Israel. \n"
    35: '³⁵ ‘This is the allotment to Aaron and the allotment to his sons from the
      offerings by fire to the Lord, on that day when he presented them to serve as
      priests to the Lord. '
    36: "³⁶ These the Lord had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel\
      \ on the day that He anointed them. It is their allotted portion forever throughout\
      \ their generations.’” \n"
    37: '³⁷ This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering
      and the guilt offering, and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace
      offerings, '
    38: ³⁸ which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day that He commanded
      the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness
      of Sinai.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil,
      and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened
      bread, '
    3: '³ and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting.” '
    4: '⁴ So Moses did just as the Lord commanded him. When the congregation was assembled
      at the doorway of the tent of meeting, '
    5: "⁵ Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which the Lord has commanded\
      \ us to do.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near, and he washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ Then he put the tunic on Aaron and wrapped his waist with the sash, and
      clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he wrapped his waist
      with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he fitted it to him. '
    8: '⁸ He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the
      Urim and the Thummim. '
    9: "⁹ He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front,\
      \ he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the Lord had commanded\
      \ Moses. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything
      that was in it, and consecrated them. '
    11: '¹¹ He also sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the
      altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. '
    12: '¹² Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed
      him, to consecrate him. '
    13: "¹³ Next Moses had Aaron’s sons come near, and he clothed them with tunics\
      \ and wrapped their waists with sashes, and bound caps on them, just as the\
      \ Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid
      their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. '
    15: '¹⁵ Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some
      of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured
      out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make
      atonement for it. '
    16: '¹⁶ He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the
      liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on
      the altar. '
    17: "¹⁷ But the bull and its hide, its flesh, and its refuse he burned in the\
      \ fire outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the head of the ram. '
    19: '¹⁹ And Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and
      the pieces and the suet in smoke. '
    21: "²¹ After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered\
      \ up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing\
      \ aroma; it was an offering by fire to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded\
      \ Moses. \n"
    22: '²² Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and
      his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. '
    23: '²³ And Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the
      lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big
      toe of his right foot. '
    24: '²⁴ He also had Aaron’s sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on
      the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the
      big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around
      on the altar. '
    25: '²⁵ He then took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the
      entrails, and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the
      right thigh. '
    26: '²⁶ And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took
      one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and
      placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh. '
    27: '²⁷ He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons,
      and presented them as a wave offering before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on
      the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing
      aroma; it was an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ Moses also took the breast and presented it as a wave offering before\
      \ the Lord; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, just as the Lord\
      \ had commanded Moses. \n"
    30: "³⁰ So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was\
      \ on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and\
      \ on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments,\
      \ and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the doorway
      of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in
      the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and
      his sons shall eat it.’ '
    32: '³² And the remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the
      fire. '
    33: '³³ And you shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven
      days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he
      will ordain you through seven days. '
    34: '³⁴ The Lord has commanded us to do as has been done this day, to make atonement
      on your behalf. '
    35: '³⁵ At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day
      and night for seven days and fulfill your duty to the Lord, so that you will
      not die; for so I have been commanded.” '
    36: ³⁶ Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord had commanded through
      Moses.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons
      and the elders of Israel; '
    2: '² and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a bull, as a sin offering
      and a ram as a burnt offering, both without defect, and offer them before the
      Lord. '
    3: '³ Then you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat as
      a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, as
      a burnt offering, '
    4: '⁴ and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and
      a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the Lord will appear to you.’” '
    5: '⁵ So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting,
      and the whole congregation came near and stood before the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord has commanded you to do,
      so that the glory of the Lord may appear to you.” '
    7: "⁷ Moses then said to Aaron, “Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering\
      \ and your burnt offering, so that you may make atonement for yourself and for\
      \ the people; then make the offering for the people, so that you may make atonement\
      \ for them, just as the Lord has commanded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering
      which was for himself. '
    9: '⁹ Aaron’s sons then presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in
      the blood and put some on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of
      the blood at the base of the altar. '
    10: '¹⁰ The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering
      he then offered up in smoke on the altar, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    11: "¹¹ The flesh and the hide, however, he burned with fire outside the camp.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons brought the blood
      to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. '
    13: '¹³ They brought the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he
      offered them up in smoke on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke\
      \ with the burnt offering on the altar. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin
      offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin,
      like the first. '
    16: '¹⁶ He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the
      ordinance. '
    17: "¹⁷ Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of\
      \ it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of\
      \ the morning. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings
      which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he
      sprinkled it around on the altar. '
    19: '¹⁹ As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail,
      the fat covering, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver, '
    20: '²⁰ they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them
      up in smoke on the altar. '
    21: "²¹ But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering\
      \ before the Lord, just as Moses had commanded. \n"
    22: '²² Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and
      he stepped down after making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace
      offerings. '
    23: '²³ And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out
      and blessed the people, the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. '
    24: ²⁴ Then fire went out from the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the
      portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and
      fell face downward.
  10:
    1: '¹ Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans,
      and after putting fire in them, placed incense on the fire and offered strange
      fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. '
    2: '² And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they
      died before the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the Lord spoke, saying,\n‘By those\
      \ who come near Me I will be treated as holy,\nAnd before all the people I will\
      \ be honored.’”\nSo Aaron, therefore, kept silent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel,
      and said to them, “Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of
      the sanctuary to an area outside of the camp.” '
    5: '⁵ So they came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, to an area
      outside the camp, just as Moses had said. '
    6: '⁶ Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not uncover
      your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you do not die and He does not become
      wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the entire house of
      Israel, shall weep for the burning which the Lord has brought about. '
    7: "⁷ You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, or you\
      \ will die; for the Lord’s anointing oil is upon you.” So they did according\
      \ to the word of Moses. \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord then spoke to Aaron, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you,
      when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you do not die—it is a permanent
      statute throughout your generations— '
    10: '¹⁰ and to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between
      the unclean and the clean, '
    11: "¹¹ and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the Lord\
      \ has spoken to them through Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar,
      “Take the grain offering that is left over from the Lord’s offerings by fire
      and eat it as unleavened bread beside the altar, for it is most holy. '
    13: '¹³ You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your allotted portion
      and your sons’ allotted portion from the Lord’s offerings by fire; for so I
      have been commanded. '
    14: '¹⁴ The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering
      you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you;
      for they have been given as your allotted portion and your sons’ allotted portion
      from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ They shall bring the thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered\
      \ by waving, along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present\
      \ as a wave offering before the Lord; so it shall be a thing perpetually due\
      \ you and your sons with you, just as the Lord has commanded.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold,
      it had been burned! So he was angry with Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and
      Ithamar, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most
      holy, and He gave it to you to take away the guilt of the congregation, to make
      atonement for them before the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary,
      you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded!” '
    19: '¹⁹ But Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin
      offering and their burnt offering before the Lord. When things like these happened
      to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight
      of the Lord?” '
    20: ²⁰ When Moses heard that, it was good in his sight.
  11:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, '
    2: '² “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘These are the creatures which you
      may eat from all the animals that are on the earth. '
    3: '³ Whatever has a divided hoof, showing split hoofs, and chews the cud, among
      the animals, that you may eat. '
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these, among those which chew the cud,
      or among those which have a divided hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud,
      it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you. '
    5: '⁵ Likewise, the rock hyrax, for though it chews cud, it does not have a divided
      hoof; it is unclean to you. '
    6: '⁶ The rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not have a divided hoof;
      it is unclean to you. '
    7: '⁷ And the pig, for though it has a divided hoof, and so it shows a split hoof,
      it does not chew cud; it is unclean to you. '
    8: "⁸ You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses; they are\
      \ unclean to you. \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘These you may eat, of whatever is in the water: everything that has fins
      and scales, in the water, in the seas, or in the rivers, you may eat. '
    10: '¹⁰ But whatever is in the seas and in the rivers that does not have fins
      and scales among all the teeming life of the water, and among all the living
      creatures that are in the water, they are detestable things to you, '
    11: '¹¹ and they shall be detestable to you; you may not eat any of their flesh,
      and you shall detest their carcasses. '
    12: "¹² Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Moreover, these you shall detest among the birds; they are detestable,
      not to be eaten: the eagle, the vulture, and the buzzard, '
    14: '¹⁴ the red kite, the falcon in its kind, '
    15: '¹⁵ every raven in its kind, '
    16: '¹⁶ the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, and the hawk in its kind, '
    17: '¹⁷ the little owl, the cormorant, and the great owl, '
    18: '¹⁸ the white owl, the pelican, and the carrion vulture, '
    19: "¹⁹ the stork, the heron in its kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat. \n"
    20: '²⁰ ‘All the winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. '
    21: '²¹ Yet these you may eat among all the winged insects that walk on all fours:
      those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to jump on the earth. '
    22: '²² These of them you may eat: the locust in its kinds, the devastating locust
      in its kinds, the cricket in its kinds, and the grasshopper in its kinds. '
    23: "²³ But all other winged insects which are four-footed are detestable to you.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ ‘By these, moreover, you will be made unclean; whoever touches their carcasses
      becomes unclean until evening, '
    25: '²⁵ and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and
      be unclean until evening. '
    26: '²⁶ As for all the animals which have a divided hoof but do not show a split
      hoof, or do not chew the cud, they are unclean to you; whoever touches them
      becomes unclean. '
    27: '²⁷ Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on
      all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean
      until evening, '
    28: "²⁸ and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be\
      \ unclean until evening; they are unclean to you. \n"
    29: '²⁹ ‘Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm
      on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the great lizard in its kinds, '
    30: '³⁰ the gecko, the crocodile, the lizard, the sand reptile, and the chameleon. '
    31: '³¹ These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches
      them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening. '
    32: '³² Also anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead becomes
      unclean, including any wooden article, or clothing, or a hide, or a sack—any
      article of which use is made—it shall be put in the water and be unclean until
      evening, then it becomes clean. '
    33: '³³ As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them may fall, whatever
      is in it becomes unclean and you shall break the vessel. '
    34: '³⁴ Any of the food which may be eaten, on which water comes, shall become
      unclean, and any liquid which may be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean. '
    35: '³⁵ Moreover, everything on which part of their carcass may fall becomes unclean;
      an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as
      unclean to you. '
    36: '³⁶ Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though
      the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean. '
    37: '³⁷ Now if a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to
      be sown, it is clean. '
    38: "³⁸ But if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it,\
      \ it is unclean to you. \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who
      touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening. '
    40: "⁴⁰ He, too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean\
      \ until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes\
      \ and be unclean until evening. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ ‘Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable, not
      to be eaten. '
    42: '⁴² Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, whatever
      has many feet, in regard to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you
      shall not eat them, because they are detestable. '
    43: '⁴³ Do not make yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that
      swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become
      unclean. '
    44: '⁴⁴ For I am the Lord your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy,
      because I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the
      swarming things that swarm on the earth. '
    45: "⁴⁵ For I am the Lord who brought you up from the land of Egypt, to be your\
      \ God; so you shall be holy, because I am holy.’” \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ This is the law regarding the animal and the bird, and every living thing
      that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth, '
    47: ⁴⁷ to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the
      edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten.
  12:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying:\n‘When a woman gives birth and delivers\
      \ a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days; as she is in the days\
      \ of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. "
    3: '³ Then on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. '
    4: '⁴ And she shall stay at home in her condition of blood purification for thirty-three
      days; she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until
      the days of her purification are completed. '
    5: "⁵ But if she gives birth to a female child, then she shall be unclean for\
      \ two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall stay at home in her condition\
      \ of blood purification for sixty-six days. \n"
    6: '⁶ ‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son or for a daughter,
      she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one-year-old
      lamb as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering. '
    7: '⁷ Then he shall offer it before the Lord and make atonement for her, and she
      shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who gives
      birth to a child, whether a male or a female. '
    8: ⁸ But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two
      young doves, the one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering; and
      the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”
  13:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, '
    2: '² “When someone has on the skin of his body a swelling, or a scab, or a bright
      spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he
      shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. '
    3: '³ The priest shall look at the infected area on the skin of the body, and
      if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be
      deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest
      has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean. '
    4: '⁴ But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not
      appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white,
      then the priest shall isolate the person who has the infection for seven days. '
    5: '⁵ Then the priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes
      the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin,
      then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days. '
    6: "⁶ The priest shall then look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infected\
      \ area has faded and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest\
      \ shall pronounce him clean; it is only a rash. And he shall wash his clothes\
      \ and be clean. \n"
    7: '⁷ “But if the rash spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself
      to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest. '
    8: "⁸ And the priest shall look, and if the rash has spread on the skin, then\
      \ the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy. \n"
    9: '⁹ “When the infection of leprosy is on someone, then he shall be brought to
      the priest. '
    10: '¹⁰ The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling on the skin,
      and it has turned the hair white, and there is new raw flesh in the swelling, '
    11: '¹¹ it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall
      pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean. '
    12: '¹² If the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers
      all the skin of the person who has the infection from his head even to his feet,
      as far as the priest can see, '
    13: '¹³ then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered his
      entire body, he shall pronounce the one who has the infection clean; it has
      all turned white and he is clean. '
    14: '¹⁴ But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean;
      the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy. '
    16: '¹⁶ Or if the raw flesh turns back and is changed to white, then he shall
      come to the priest, '
    17: "¹⁷ and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infected area has\
      \ turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the one who has the infection\
      \ clean; he is clean. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Now when the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed, '
    19: '¹⁹ and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white,
      bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest; '
    20: '²⁰ and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be deeper than
      the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce
      him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil. '
    21: '²¹ But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in
      it and it is not deeper than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate
      him for seven days; '
    22: '²² and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce
      him unclean; it is an infection. '
    23: "²³ But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is\
      \ only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh
      of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white, '
    25: '²⁵ then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has
      turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has
      broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it
      is an infection of leprosy. '
    26: '²⁶ But if the priest looks at it, and indeed, there is no white hair in the
      bright spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall
      isolate him for seven days; '
    27: '²⁷ and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther
      in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection
      of leprosy. '
    28: "²⁸ But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the\
      \ skin, but is dim, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce\
      \ him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard, '
    30: '³⁰ then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper
      than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall
      pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. '
    31: '³¹ But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and indeed, it
      appears to be no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then
      the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days. '
    32: '³² And on the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if
      the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the appearance
      of the scale is no deeper than the skin, '
    33: '³³ then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the
      priest shall isolate the person with the scale for seven more days. '
    34: '³⁴ Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the
      scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin,
      the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean. '
    35: '³⁵ But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing, '
    36: '³⁶ then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread on the
      skin, the priest need not look for the yellowish hair; he is unclean. '
    37: "³⁷ If in his sight the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown\
      \ in it, the scale has healed, and he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce\
      \ him clean. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, white
      bright spots, '
    39: "³⁹ then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their\
      \ bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he\
      \ is clean. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is only bald; he is clean. '
    41: '⁴¹ And if his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the
      forehead; he is clean. '
    42: '⁴² But if on the bald head or the bald forehead there occurs a reddish-white
      infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead. '
    43: '⁴³ Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection
      is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance
      of leprosy in the skin of the body, '
    44: "⁴⁴ he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean;\
      \ his infection is on his head. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ “As for the person who has the leprous infection, his clothes shall be
      torn and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache
      and call out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ '
    46: "⁴⁶ He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection;\
      \ he is unclean. He shall live alone; he shall live outside the camp. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ “When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment
      or a linen garment, '
    48: '⁴⁸ whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in
      any article made of leather, '
    49: '⁴⁹ if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whether
      in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark
      and it shall be shown to the priest. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article
      with the mark for seven days. '
    51: '⁵¹ He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread
      in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever
      the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy,
      it is unclean. '
    52: "⁵² So he shall burn the garment, whether it is the warp or the woof, in wool\
      \ or in linen, or any article of leather, in which the mark occurs; for it is\
      \ a leprous malignancy. It shall be burned in the fire. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “But if the priest looks, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment,
      either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, '
    54: '⁵⁴ then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs,

    55: "⁵⁵ After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again\
      \ look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even if the mark has\
      \ not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating\
      \ away has produced bareness on the back or on the front of it. \n"
    56: '⁵⁶ “But if the priest looks, and indeed the mark has faded after it has been
      washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether
      from the warp or from the woof; '
    57: '⁵⁷ yet if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the
      woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the
      mark shall be burned in the fire. '
    58: "⁵⁸ But the garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of leather\
      \ from which the mark has disappeared when you washed it, shall then be washed\

    59: ⁵⁹ This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen,
      whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing
      it clean or unclean.
  14:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “This shall be the law of the person with leprosy on the day of his cleansing.
      Now he shall be brought to the priest; '

      shall look, and if the leprous infection has been healed in the person with
      leprosy, '
    4: '⁴ then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds, cedar wood,
      a scarlet string, and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall also give orders to slaughter the one bird in an earthenware
      vessel over running water. '
    6: '⁶ As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood, the
      scarlet string, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the
      blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the running water. '
    7: '⁷ He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the
      leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird go free over

    14: '¹⁴ The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and

    41: '⁴¹ And he shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall
      dump the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city. '
    42: "⁴² Then they shall take other stones and replace the discarded stones, and\

    43: '⁴³ “If, however, the spot breaks out again in the house after he has pulled
      out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been replastered, '
    44: '⁴⁴ then the priest shall come in and make an inspection. If he sees that
      the spot has indeed spread in the house, it is a malignant spot in the house;

  16:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when
      they had approached the presence of the Lord and died. '
    2: "² The Lord said to Moses:\n“Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter\
      \ at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the atoning cover\
      \ which is on the ark, or he will die; for I will appear in the cloud over the\
      \ atoning cover. "
    3: '³ Aaron shall enter the Holy Place with this: with a bull as a sin offering
      and a ram as a burnt offering. '
    4: '⁴ He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall
      be next to his body, and he shall be wrapped about the waist with the linen
      sash and the linen turban wound around his forehead (these are holy garments).
      He shall bathe his body in water and put them on. '
    5: '⁵ And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats
      as a sin offering, and one ram as a burnt offering. '
    6: '⁶ Then Aaron shall offer the bull as the sin offering, which is for himself,
      so that he may make atonement for himself and for his household. '
    7: '⁷ He shall then take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the
      doorway of the tent of meeting. '
    8: '⁸ Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other
      lot for the scapegoat. '
    9: '⁹ Then Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the Lord fell, and
      make it a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented\
      \ alive before the Lord, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness\
      \ as the scapegoat. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Then Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself
      and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter
      the bull of the sin offering which is for himself. '
    12: '¹² He shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before
      the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside
      the veil. '
    13: '¹³ He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, so that the cloud
      of incense may cover the atoning cover that is on the ark of the testimony,
      otherwise he will die. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it\
      \ with his finger on the atoning cover on the east side; also in front of the\
      \ atoning cover he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering, which is for the
      people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did
      with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the atoning cover and in front
      of the atoning cover. '
    16: '¹⁶ He shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the impurities
      of the sons of Israel and because of their unlawful acts regarding all their
      sins; and he shall do so for the tent of meeting which remains with them in
      the midst of their impurities. '
    17: '¹⁷ When he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place, no one shall be in
      the tent of meeting until he comes out, so that he may make atonement for himself
      and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord and make atonement
      for it; he shall take some of the blood from the bull and some of the blood
      from the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides. '
    19: "¹⁹ With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times\
      \ and cleanse it, and consecrate it from the impurities of the sons of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “When he finishes atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and
      the altar, he shall offer the live goat. '
    21: '²¹ Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and
      confess over it all the wrongdoings of the sons of Israel and all their unlawful
      acts regarding all their sins; and he shall place them on the head of the goat
      and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands ready. '
    22: "²² Then the goat shall carry on itself all their wrongdoings to an isolated\
      \ territory; he shall release the goat in the wilderness. \n"
    23: '²³ “Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen
      garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them
      there. '
    24: '²⁴ And he shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his
      clothes, and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of
      the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. '
    25: '²⁵ Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar. '
    26: '²⁶ The one who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes
      and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp. '
    27: '²⁷ But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose
      blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be taken outside
      the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in
      the fire. '
    28: "²⁸ Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body\
      \ with water; and afterward he shall come into the camp. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh month, on the
      tenth day of the month, you shall humble yourselves and not do any work, whether
      the native, or the stranger who resides among you; '
    30: '³⁰ for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse
      you; you will be clean from all your sins before the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ It is to be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, so that you may humble yourselves;
      it is a permanent statute. '
    32: '³² So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s
      place shall make atonement: he shall put on the linen garments, the holy garments, '
    33: '³³ and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement
      for the tent of meeting and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for
      the priests and for all the people of the assembly. '
    34: ³⁴ Now you shall have this as a permanent statute, to make atonement for the
      sons of Israel for all their sins once every year.” And just as the Lord had
      commanded Moses, so he did.
  17:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel, and say to
      them, ‘This is what the Lord has commanded, saying, '
    3: '³ “Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, a lamb, or a goat
      in the camp, or slaughters it outside the camp, '
    4: '⁴ and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present
      it as an offering to the Lord in front of the tabernacle of the Lord, bloodshed
      is to be counted against that person. He has shed blood, and that person shall
      be cut off from among his people. '
    5: '⁵ This shall be done so that the sons of Israel will bring their sacrifices
      which they were sacrificing in the open field—so that they will bring them to
      the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice
      them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the Lord at the doorway
      of the tent of meeting, and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to
      the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons with\
      \ which they play the prostitute. This shall be a permanent statute to them\
      \ throughout their generations.”’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Then you shall say to them, ‘Anyone from the house of Israel, or from the
      strangers who reside among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, '
    9: "⁹ and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it\
      \ to the Lord, that person also shall be cut off from his people. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘And anyone from the house of Israel, or from the strangers who reside
      among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats
      the blood, and will cut him off from among his people. '
    11: '¹¹ For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you
      on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason
      of the life that makes atonement.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘No person among you may eat blood,
      nor may any stranger who resides among you eat blood.’ '
    13: "¹³ So when anyone from the sons of Israel, or from the strangers who reside\
      \ among them, while hunting catches an animal or a bird which may be eaten,\
      \ he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dirt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life.
      Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘You are not to eat the blood of any
      flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut
      off.’ '
    15: '¹⁵ And any person who eats an animal which dies or is torn by animals, whether
      he is a native or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and
      remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean. '
    16: ¹⁶ But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe his body, then he shall bear
      the responsibility for his guilt.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '

    18: "¹⁸ And you shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a second\

      My sanctuary and to profane My holy name. '
    4: '⁴ If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when
      he gives any of his children to Molech, so as not to put him to death, '
    5: "⁵ then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family,\
      \ and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play\
      \ the prostitute with him, by playing the prostitute with Molech. \n"
    6: '⁶ ‘As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to play the prostitute
      with them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off
      from among his people. '
    7: '⁷ You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the Lord
      your God. '
    8: "⁸ So you shall keep My statutes and practice them; I am the Lord who sanctifies\
      \ you. \n"
    9: "⁹ ‘If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall certainly\
      \ be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother, and has brought his\
      \ own death upon himself. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If there is a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, one who
      commits adultery with his friend’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress must
      be put to death. '
    11: '¹¹ If there is a man who sleeps with his father’s wife, he has uncovered
      his father’s nakedness. Both of them must be put to death, they have brought
      their own deaths upon themselves. '
    12: '¹² If there is a man who sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both of them must
      be put to death. They have committed incest, and have brought their own deaths
      upon themselves. '
    13: '¹³ If there is a man who sleeps with a male as those who sleep with a woman,
      both of them have committed a detestable act; they must be put to death. They
      have brought their own deaths upon themselves. '
    14: '¹⁴ If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is an outrageous
      sin; both he and they shall be burned with fire, so that there will be no such
      outrageous sin in your midst. '
    15: '¹⁵ If there is a man who has sexual intercourse with an animal, he must be
      put to death; you shall also kill the animal. '
    16: "¹⁶ If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall\
      \ kill the woman and the animal; they must be put to death. They have brought\
      \ their own deaths upon themselves. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘If there is a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his
      mother’s daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness,
      it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their
      people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he bears his guilt. '
    18: '¹⁸ If there is a man who sleeps with a menstruous woman and uncovers her
      nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood;
      so both of them shall be cut off from among their people. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of
      your father’s sister, for such a one has uncovered his blood relative; they
      will bear their guilt. '
    20: '²⁰ If there is a man who sleeps with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his
      uncle’s nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless. '
    21: "²¹ If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is detestable; he has\
      \ uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They will be childless. \n"
    22: '²² ‘You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and
      do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not vomit
      you out. '
    23: '²³ Furthermore, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I am
      going to drive out before you, because they did all these things; therefore
      I have felt disgust for them. '
    24: '²⁴ So I have said to you, “You are to take possession of their land, and
      I Myself will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
      I am the Lord your God, who has singled you out from the peoples. '
    25: '²⁵ You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the
      unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make
      yourselves detestable by animal or by bird, or by anything that crawls on the
      ground, which I have distinguished for you as unclean. '
    26: "²⁶ So you are to be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy; and I have singled\
      \ you out from the peoples to be Mine. \n"
    27: ²⁷ ‘Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist must be put to death.
      They shall be stoned with stones; they have brought their own deaths upon themselves.’”
  21:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and\
      \ say to them:\n‘No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people, "
    2: '² except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother, his father,
      his son, his daughter, and his brother, '
    3: '³ also for his virgin sister who is near to him because she has not had a
      husband; for her, he may defile himself. '
    4: '⁴ He shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people,
      so as to profane himself. '
    5: '⁵ They shall not shave any area on their heads bald, nor shave off the edges
      of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh. '
    6: '⁶ They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, because
      they present the offerings by fire to the Lord, the food of their God; so they
      shall be holy. '
    7: '⁷ They shall not take a woman who is a prostitute and profaned, nor shall
      they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God. '
    8: '⁸ You shall consecrate him, therefore, because he offers the food of your
      God. He shall be holy to you; for I the Lord, who sanctifies you, am holy. '
    9: "⁹ Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by prostitution,\
      \ she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘The priest who is highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing
      oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall
      not uncover his head nor tear his clothes; '
    11: '¹¹ nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself even for his
      father or his mother; '
    12: '¹² nor shall he leave the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God,
      for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ He shall take a wife in her virginity. '
    14: '¹⁴ A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by prostitution,
      these he shall not take; but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people, '
    15: "¹⁵ so that he will not profane his children among his people; for I am the\
      \ Lord who sanctifies him.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Speak to Aaron, saying, ‘None of your descendants throughout their generations
      who has an impairment shall approach to offer the food of his God. '
    18: '¹⁸ For no one who has an impairment shall approach: a man who is blind, or
      one who limps, or one who has a slit nose, or one with any conspicuous feature, '
    19: '¹⁹ or someone who has a broken foot or broken hand, '
    20: '²⁰ or a contorted back, or one who is a dwarf, or has a spot in his eye,
      or a festering rash or scabs, or crushed testicles. '
    21: '²¹ No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has an impairment
      is to come forward to offer the Lord’s offerings by fire; since he has an impairment,
      he shall not come forward to offer the food of his God. '
    22: '²² He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy, '
    23: '²³ only he shall not come up to the veil or approach the altar, since he
      has an impairment, so that he does not profane My sanctuaries. For I am the
      Lord who sanctifies them.’” '
    24: ²⁴ So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of
      Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the
      Lord. '
    3: '³ Say to them, ‘Any man among all your descendants throughout your generations
      who approaches the holy gifts which the sons of Israel consecrate to the Lord,
      while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from My presence;
      I am the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ No man of the descendants of Aaron, who has leprosy or has a discharge,
      may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean. And one who touches anything made
      unclean by a corpse, or a man who has a seminal emission, '
    5: '⁵ or a man who touches any swarming things by which he is made unclean, or
      touches any person by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness; '
    6: '⁶ a person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until evening, and
      shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water. '
    7: '⁷ But when the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he may eat of the
      holy gifts, for it is his food. '
    8: '⁸ He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by animals, becoming unclean
      by it; I am the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ They shall therefore perform their duty to Me, so that they do not bear\
      \ sin because of it and die by it because they profane it; I am the Lord who\
      \ sanctifies them. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘No layman, however, is to eat the holy gift; a foreign resident with
      the priest or a hired worker shall not eat the holy gift. '
    11: '¹¹ But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, that person
      may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food. '
    12: '¹² If a priest’s daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the
      offering of the holy gifts. '
    13: '¹³ But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child
      and returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s
      food; but no layman shall eat of it. '
    14: '¹⁴ If, however, someone eats a holy food unintentionally, then he shall add
      to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy food to the priest. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which
      they offer to the Lord, '
    16: "¹⁶ and thereby bring upon them punishment for guilt by eating their holy\
      \ gifts; for I am the Lord who sanctifies them.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say
      to them, ‘Anyone of the house of Israel or of the strangers in Israel who presents
      his offering, whether it is any of their vows or any of their voluntary offerings,
      which they present to the Lord as a burnt offering— '
    19: '¹⁹ for you to be accepted—it must be a male without defect from the cattle,
      the sheep, or the goats. '
    20: '²⁰ Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted
      for you. '
    21: '²¹ When someone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord to fulfill
      a special vow or for a voluntary offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must
      be without defect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it. '
    22: '²² Those that are blind, fractured, maimed, or have a wart, a festering rash,
      or scabs, you shall not offer to the Lord, nor make of them an offering by fire
      on the altar to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ Now as for an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member, you
      may present it as a voluntary offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted. '
    24: '²⁴ Also anything with its testicles squashed, crushed, torn off, or cut off,
      you shall not offer to the Lord, nor sacrifice in your land, '
    25: "²⁵ nor shall you offer any of these animals taken from the hand of a foreigner\
      \ as the food of your God; for their deformity is in them, they have an impairment.\
      \ They will not be accepted for you.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with
      its mother, and from the eighth day on it will be considered acceptable as a
      sacrifice of an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ But, whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not slaughter both it and
      its young in one day. '
    29: '²⁹ When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord, you shall
      sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. '
    30: '³⁰ It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning.
      I am the Lord. '
    31: "³¹ So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am the Lord. \n"
    32: '³² “And you shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among
      the sons of Israel; I am the Lord who sanctifies you, '
    33: ³³ who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the Lord.”
  23:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke again to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord’s appointed times\
      \ which you shall proclaim as holy convocations—My appointed times are these:\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ ‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath\
      \ of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a Sabbath\
      \ to the Lord in all your dwellings. \n"
    4: '⁴ ‘These are the appointed times of the Lord, holy convocations which you
      shall proclaim at the times appointed for them. '
    5: '⁵ In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the
      Lord’s Passover. '
    6: '⁶ Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened
      Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. '
    7: '⁷ On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any
      laborious work. '
    8: "⁸ But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord. On\
      \ the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.’”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land
      which I am going to give to you and you gather its harvest, then you shall bring
      in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord for you to be accepted; on the
      day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. '
    12: '¹² Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one
      year old without defect as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
      mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the Lord for a soothing aroma, with its
      drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine. '
    14: "¹⁴ Until this very day, until you have brought in the offering of your God,\
      \ you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new produce. It is to be\
      \ a permanent statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ ‘You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from
      the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven
      complete Sabbaths. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then
      you shall present a new grain offering to the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall bring in from your dwelling places two loaves of bread as a
      wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour,
      baked with leaven as first fruits to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ Along with the bread you shall present seven one-year-old male lambs without
      defect, and a bull of the herd and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering
      to the Lord, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering
      by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs
      one year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits as
      a wave offering with two lambs before the Lord; they are to be holy to the Lord
      for the priest. '
    21: "²¹ On this very day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have\
      \ a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a permanent\
      \ statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations. \n"
    22: "²² ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap\
      \ to the very edges of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you\
      \ are to leave them for the needy and the stranger. I am the Lord your God.’”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month on the first
      of the month you shall have a rest, a reminder by blowing of trumpets, a holy
      convocation. '
    25: "²⁵ You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering\
      \ by fire to the Lord.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement;
      it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble yourselves and
      present an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall not do any work on this very day, for it is a Day of Atonement,
      to make atonement on your behalf before the Lord your God. '
    29: '²⁹ If there is any person who does not humble himself on this very day, he
      shall be cut off from his people. '
    30: '³⁰ As for any person who does any work on this very day, that person I will
      eliminate from among his people. '
    31: '³¹ You shall not do any work. It is to be a permanent statute throughout
      your generations in all your dwelling places. '
    32: "³² It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves;\
      \ on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening, you shall\
      \ keep your Sabbath.” \n"
    33: '³³ Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    34: '³⁴ “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘On the fifteenth of this seventh
      month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the Lord. '
    35: '³⁵ On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious
      work. '
    36: "³⁶ For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord. On the\
      \ eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire\
      \ to the Lord; it is an assembly. You shall not do any laborious work. \n"
    37: '³⁷ ‘These are the appointed times of the Lord which you shall proclaim as
      holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the Lord—burnt offerings
      and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day’s matter on its
      own day— '
    38: "³⁸ besides those of the Sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts and\
      \ besides all your vowed and voluntary offerings, which you give to the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered
      in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord for seven
      days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful
      trees, palm branches and branches of trees with thick branches and willows of
      the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. '
    41: '⁴¹ So you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the
      year. It shall be a permanent statute throughout your generations; you shall
      celebrate it in the seventh month. '
    42: '⁴² You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel
      shall live in booths, '
    43: '⁴³ so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in
      booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’” '
    44: ⁴⁴ So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten
      olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually. '
    3: '³ Outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep
      it in order from evening to morning before the Lord continually; it shall be
      a permanent statute throughout your generations. '
    4: "⁴ He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord\
      \ continually. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths
      of an ephah shall be in each cake. '
    6: '⁶ And you shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table
      before the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ You shall put pure frankincense on each row so that it may be a memorial
      portion for the bread, an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before the Lord continually;
      it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel. '
    9: "⁹ And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy\
      \ place; for it is most holy to him from the Lord’s offerings by fire, his portion\
      \ forever.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now the son of an Israelite woman—his father was an Egyptian—went out
      among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman’s son and an Israelite man
      had a fight within the camp. '
    11: '¹¹ And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So
      they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter
      of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) '
    12: "¹² Then they put him in custody, waiting for Moses to give them a clear decision\
      \ in accordance with the command of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ “Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and have all who heard
      him lay their hands on his head; then have all the congregation stone him. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall also speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone curses
      his God, then he will bear the responsibility for his sin. '
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death;\
      \ all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The stranger as well as the\
      \ native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Now if someone takes any human life, he must be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ But the one who takes the life of an animal shall make restitution, life
      for life. '
    19: '¹⁹ If someone injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so shall it be done
      to him: '
    20: '²⁰ fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured
      a person, so shall it be inflicted on him. '
    21: '²¹ So the one who kills an animal shall make restitution, but the one who
      kills a person shall be put to death. '
    22: '²² There shall be only one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger
      as well as the native, for I am the Lord your God.’” '
    23: ²³ Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had
      cursed outside the camp, and stoned him with stones. So the sons of Israel did
      just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: '¹ The Lord then spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land
      which I am going to give you, then the land shall have a Sabbath to the Lord. '
    3: '³ For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune
      your vineyard and gather in its produce, '
    4: '⁴ but during the seventh year the land shall have a Sabbath rest, a Sabbath
      to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard. '
    5: '⁵ You shall not reap your harvest’s aftergrowth, and you shall not gather
      your grapes of untrimmed vines; the land shall have a sabbatical year. '
    6: '⁶ All of you shall have the Sabbath produce of the land as food; for yourself,
      your male and female slaves, and your hired worker and your foreign resident,
      those who live as strangers among you. '
    7: "⁷ Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its\
      \ produce to eat. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘You are also to count off seven Sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times
      seven years, so that you have the time of the seven Sabbaths of years, that
      is, forty-nine years. '
    9: '⁹ You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh
      month; on the Day of Atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. '
    10: '¹⁰ So you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release throughout
      the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of
      you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor
      harvest its aftergrowth, nor gather grapes from its untrimmed vines. '
    12: "¹² For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce\
      \ from the field. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property. '
    14: '¹⁴ Furthermore, if you make a sale to your friend, or buy from your friend’s
      hand, you shall not wrong one another. '
    15: '¹⁵ Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy
      from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops. '
    16: '¹⁶ In proportion to a greater number of years you shall increase its price,
      and in proportion to fewer years you shall decrease its price, because it is
      the number of crops that he is selling to you. '
    17: "¹⁷ So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I\
      \ am the Lord your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ ‘You shall therefore follow My statutes and keep My judgments so as to
      carry them out, so that you may live securely on the land. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and
      live securely on it. '
    20: '²⁰ But if you say, “What are we going to eat in the seventh year if we do
      not sow nor gather in our produce?” '
    21: '²¹ then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will
      bring forth the produce for three years. '
    22: "²² When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from\
      \ the produce, eating the old until the ninth year when its produce comes in.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ ‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, because the land is
      Mine; for you are only strangers and residents with Me. '
    24: "²⁴ So for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption\
      \ of the land. \n"
    25: '²⁵ ‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor that he sells part of
      his property, then his closest redeemer is to come and buy back what his relative
      has sold. '
    26: '²⁶ Or in case someone has no redeemer, but recovers to find sufficient means
      for its redemption, '
    27: '²⁷ then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance
      to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property. '
    28: "²⁸ But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then\
      \ what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year\
      \ of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, so that he may return to his\
      \ property. \n"
    29: '²⁹ ‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his
      redemption right remains valid until a full year after its sale; his right of
      redemption lasts a full year. '
    30: '³⁰ But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year,
      then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser
      throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee. '
    31: '³¹ The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall, shall
      be regarded as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee. '
    32: '³² As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of
      redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession. '
    33: '³³ What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed, and a house sale
      in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee, because the houses of
      the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel. '
    34: "³⁴ But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their\
      \ permanent possession. \n"
    35: '³⁵ ‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means among you
      falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a resident, so that
      he may live with you. '
    36: '³⁶ Do not take any kind of interest from him, but fear your God, so that
      your countryman may live with you. '
    37: '³⁷ You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for profit. '
    38: "³⁸ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give\
      \ you the land of Canaan, and to be your God. \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘Now if a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that
      he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. '
    40: '⁴⁰ He shall be with you as a hired worker, as if he were a foreign resident;
      he shall serve with you up to the year of jubilee. '
    41: '⁴¹ He shall then leave you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to
      his family, so that he may return to the property of his forefathers. '
    42: '⁴² For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they
      are not to be sold in a slave sale. '
    43: '⁴³ You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. '
    44: '⁴⁴ As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male
      and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You may also acquire them from the sons of the foreign residents who reside
      among you, and from their families who are with you, whom they will have produced
      in your land; they also may become your possession. '
    46: "⁴⁶ You may also pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you, to\
      \ receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect\
      \ to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over\
      \ one another. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ ‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a foreign resident with you becomes
      sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes poor in relation to him and sells
      himself to a stranger who is residing with you, or to the descendants of a stranger’s
      family, '
    48: '⁴⁸ then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his
      brothers may redeem him, '
    49: '⁴⁹ or his uncle, or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives
      from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. '
    50: '⁵⁰ He then, with his purchaser, shall calculate from the year when he sold
      himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond
      to the number of years calculated. It is like the days of a hired worker that
      he will be with him. '
    51: '⁵¹ If there are still many years remaining, he shall refund part of his purchase
      price in proportion to them for his own redemption; '
    52: '⁵² but if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate
      with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption. '
    53: '⁵³ He shall be with him like a worker hired year by year; he shall not rule
      over him with severity in your sight. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still leave in the
      year of jubilee, he and his sons with him. '
    55: ⁵⁵ For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought
      out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
  26:
    1: '¹ ‘You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set up for yourselves
      a carved image or a memorial stone, nor shall you place a figured stone in your
      land to bow down to it; for I am the Lord your God. '
    2: '² You shall keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary; I am the Lord. '
    3: '³ If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them
      out, '
    4: '⁴ then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield
      its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit. '
    5: '⁵ Indeed, your threshing season will last for you until grape gathering, and
      grape gathering will last until sowing time. So you will eat your food to the
      full and live securely in your land. '
    6: '⁶ I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down, with no
      one to make you afraid. I shall also eliminate harmful animals from the land,
      and no sword will pass through your land. '
    7: '⁷ Instead, you will chase your enemies, and they will fall before you by the
      sword; '
    8: '⁸ five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand;
      and your enemies will fall before you by the sword. '
    9: '⁹ So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I
      will confirm My covenant with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ And you will eat the old supply, and clear out the old because of the
      new. '
    11: '¹¹ Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject
      you. '
    12: '¹² I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people. '
    13: "¹³ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that\
      \ you would not be their slaves, and I broke your yoke and made you walk erect.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments, '
    15: '¹⁵ if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul loathes My ordinances
      so as not to carry out all My commandments, but rather to break My covenant, '
    16: '¹⁶ I, in turn, will do this to you: I will summon a sudden terror against
      you, consumption and fever that will make the eyes fail and the soul languish;
      also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat it. '
    17: '¹⁷ And I will set My face against you so that you will be defeated before
      your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when
      no one is pursuing you. '
    18: '¹⁸ If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will punish you
      seven times more for your sins. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will also break down your pride of power; and I will make your sky like
      iron and your earth like bronze. '
    20: "²⁰ Your strength will be consumed uselessly, for your land will not yield\
      \ its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit. \n"
    21: '²¹ ‘Yet if you show hostility toward Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will
      increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins. '
    22: "²² I will also let loose among you the animals of the field, which will deprive\
      \ you of your children and eliminate your cattle, and reduce your number so\
      \ that your roads become deserted. \n"
    23: '²³ ‘And if by these things you do not learn your lesson regarding Me, but
      you show hostility toward Me, '
    24: '²⁴ then I in turn will show hostility toward you; and I, even I, will strike
      you seven times for your sins. '
    25: '²⁵ I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the
      covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send a plague
      among you, so that you will be handed over to the enemy. '
    26: "²⁶ When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one\
      \ oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you\
      \ will eat and not be satisfied. \n"
    27: '²⁷ ‘Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against
      Me, '
    28: '²⁸ then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and I for My part
      will punish you seven times for your sins. '
    29: '²⁹ Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh
      of your daughters. '
    30: '³⁰ I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars,
      and pile your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul will loathe
      you. '
    31: '³¹ I will turn your cities into ruins as well and make your sanctuaries desolate,
      and I will not smell your soothing aromas. '
    32: '³² And I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it
      will be appalled at it. '
    33: "³³ You, however, I will scatter among the nations, and I will draw out a\
      \ sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become ruins.\
      \ \n"
    34: '³⁴ ‘Then the land will restore its Sabbaths all the days of the desolation,
      while you are in your enemies’ land; then the land will rest and restore its
      Sabbaths. '
    35: '³⁵ All the days of its desolation it will have the rest which it did not
      have on your Sabbaths, while you were living on it. '
    36: '³⁶ As for those among you who are left, I will also bring despair into their
      hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a scattered leaf will
      chase them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the
      sword, and they will fall. '
    37: '³⁷ They will then stumble over each other as if running from the sword, although
      no one is pursuing; and you will have no strength to stand before your enemies. '
    38: '³⁸ Instead, you will perish among the nations, and your enemies’ land will
      consume you. '
    39: "³⁹ So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their wrongdoing\
      \ in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the wrongdoing of their\
      \ forefathers they will rot away with them. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ ‘But if they confess their wrongdoing and the wrongdoing of their forefathers,
      in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also in their acting
      with hostility against Me— '
    41: '⁴¹ I also was acting with hostility against them, to bring them into the
      land of their enemies—or if their uncircumcised heart is humbled so that they
      then make amends for their wrongdoing, '
    42: '⁴² then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also
      My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember
      the land. '
    43: '⁴³ For the land will be abandoned by them, and will restore its Sabbaths
      while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, will be making amends
      for their wrongdoing, because they rejected My ordinances and their soul loathed
      My statutes. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will
      not reject them, nor will I so loathe them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant
      with them; for I am the Lord their God. '
    45: "⁴⁵ But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I\
      \ brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, so that I might\
      \ be their God. I am the Lord.’” \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the Lord established
      between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses on Mount Sinai.
  27:
    1: '¹ Again, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When someone makes an explicit
      vow, he shall be valued according to your assessment of persons belonging to
      the Lord. '
    3: '³ If your assessment is of a male from twenty years even to sixty years old,
      then your assessment shall be fifty shekels of silver, by the shekel of the
      sanctuary. '
    4: '⁴ Or if the person is a female, then your assessment shall be thirty shekels. '
    5: '⁵ And if the person is from five years even to twenty years old, then your
      assessment for a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female, ten shekels. '
    6: '⁶ But if the person is from a month even up to five years old, then your assessment
      shall be five shekels of silver for a male, and for a female your assessment
      shall be three shekels of silver. '
    7: '⁷ If the person is from sixty years old and upward, if a male, then your assessment
      shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels. '
    8: "⁸ But if he is poorer than your assessment, then he shall be presented before\
      \ the priest, and the priest shall assess him; according to the means of the\
      \ one who vowed, the priest shall assess him. \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘Now if it is an animal of the kind that one can present as an offering
      to the Lord, any such animal that one gives to the Lord shall be holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall not replace it nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for
      a good; yet if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute
      shall become holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which one does not present
      as an offering to the Lord, then he shall place the animal before the priest. '
    12: '¹² And the priest shall assess it as either good or bad; as you, the priest,
      assess it, so shall it be. '
    13: "¹³ But if he should ever want to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of\
      \ it to your assessment. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Now if someone consecrates his house as holy to the Lord, then the priest
      shall assess it as either good or bad; as the priest assesses it, so shall it
      stand. '
    15: "¹⁵ Yet if the one who consecrates it should want to redeem his house, then\
      \ he shall add a fifth of your assessment price to it, so that it may be his.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ ‘Again, if someone consecrates to the Lord part of the field of his own
      property, then your assessment shall be proportionate to the seed needed for
      it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver. '
    17: '¹⁷ If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your
      assessment it shall stand. '
    18: '¹⁸ If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest
      shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until
      the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your assessment. '
    19: '¹⁹ If the one who consecrates it should ever want to redeem the field, then
      he shall add a fifth of your assessment price to it, so that it may belong to
      him. '
    20: '²⁰ Yet if he does not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another
      person, it may no longer be redeemed; '
    21: '²¹ and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the Lord,
      like a field banned from secular use; it shall be for the priest as his property. '
    22: '²² Or if he consecrates to the Lord a field which he has bought, which is
      not a part of the field of his own property, '
    23: '²³ then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your assessment
      up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your assessment as
      holy to the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he
      bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs. '
    25: "²⁵ Every assessment of yours, moreover, shall be by the shekel of the sanctuary.\
      \ The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. \n"
    26: '²⁶ ‘However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the
      Lord, no one may consecrate; whether ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s. '
    27: "²⁷ But if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall redeem it according\
      \ to your assessment and add to it a fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed,\
      \ then it shall be sold according to your assessment. \n"
    28: '²⁸ ‘Nevertheless, anything which someone sets apart to the Lord for destruction
      out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the field of his own property,
      shall not be sold nor redeemed. Anything set apart for destruction is most holy
      to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ No one who may have been set apart among mankind shall be ransomed; he\
      \ must be put to death. \n"
    30: '³⁰ ‘Now all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit
      of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ If, therefore, someone should ever want to redeem part of his tithe, he
      shall add to it a fifth of it. '
    32: '³² For every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod,
      the tenth one shall be holy to the Lord. '
    33: "³³ He is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange\
      \ it; yet if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become\
      \ holy. It shall not be redeemed.’” \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons
      of Israel on Mount Sinai.
