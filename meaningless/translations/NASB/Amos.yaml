Amos:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders from Tekoa, which he saw\
      \ in visions concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the\
      \ days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And he said,\n“The Lord roars from Zion,\nAnd from Jerusalem He utters His\
      \ voice;\nAnd the shepherds’ pasture grounds mourn,\nAnd the summit of Carmel\
      \ dries up.” \n"
    3: "³ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Damascus, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they threshed Gilead with iron sledges.\n"
    4: "⁴ So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael,\nAnd it will consume the citadels\
      \ of Ben-hadad.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will also break the gate bar of Damascus,\nAnd eliminate every inhabitant\
      \ from the Valley of Aven,\nAs well as him who holds the scepter, from Beth-eden;\n\
      So the people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Gaza, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they led into exile an entire population\n\
      To turn them over to Edom.\n"
    7: "⁷ So I will send fire on the wall of Gaza\nAnd it will consume her citadels.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will also eliminate every inhabitant from Ashdod,\nAs well as him who\
      \ holds the scepter, from Ashkelon;\nAnd I will direct My power against Ekron,\n\
      And the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”\nSays the Lord God. \n"
    9: "⁹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Tyre, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they turned an entire population\
      \ over to Edom\nAnd did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So I will send fire on the wall of Tyre,\nAnd it will consume her citadels.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Edom, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause he pursued his brother with the sword\n\
      And stifled his compassion;\nHis anger also tore continually,\nAnd he maintained\
      \ his fury forever.\n"
    12: "¹² So I will send fire upon Teman\nAnd it will consume the citadels of Bozrah.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of the sons of Ammon,\
      \ and for four,\nI will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they ripped open\
      \ the pregnant women of Gilead\nIn order to enlarge their borders.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah,\nAnd it will consume her\
      \ citadels\nAmid war cries on the day of battle,\nAnd amid a storm on the day\
      \ of tempest.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Their king will go into exile,\nHe and his princes together,” says the\
      \ Lord."
  2:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Moab, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause he burned the bones of the king of\
      \ Edom to lime.\n"
    2: "² So I will send fire upon Moab\nAnd it will consume the citadels of Kerioth;\n\
      And Moab will die amid the panic of battle,\nAmid war cries and the sound of\
      \ a trumpet.\n"
    3: "³ I will also eliminate the judge from her midst\nAnd slay all her leaders\
      \ with him,” says the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Judah, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they rejected the Law of the Lord\n\
      And have not kept His statutes;\nTheir lies also have led them astray,\nThose\
      \ which their fathers followed.\n"
    5: "⁵ So I will send fire upon Judah,\nAnd it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three offenses of Israel, and for four,\n\
      I will not revoke its punishment,\nBecause they sell the righteous for money,\n\
      And the needy for a pair of sandals.\n"
    7: "⁷ These who trample the head of the helpless to the dust of the earth\nAlso\
      \ divert the way of the humble;\nAnd a man and his father resort to the same\
      \ girl\nSo as to profane My holy name.\n"
    8: "⁸ And on garments seized as pledges they stretch out beside every altar,\n\
      And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ “Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,\nThough his height\
      \ was like the height of cedars\nAnd he was as strong as the oaks;\nI also destroyed\
      \ his fruit above and his roots below.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ And it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,\nAnd led you in\
      \ the wilderness for forty years\nSo that you might take possession of the land\
      \ of the Amorite.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets,\nAnd some of your young\
      \ men to be Nazirites.\nIs this not so, you sons of Israel?” declares the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “But you made the Nazirites drink wine,\nAnd you commanded the prophets,\
      \ saying, ‘You shall not prophesy!’\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, I am making a rut in the ground beneath you,\nJust as a wagon\
      \ makes a rut when filled with sheaves.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Refuge will be lost from the swift,\nAnd the strong will not strengthen\
      \ his power,\nNor the warrior save his life.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The one who grasps the bow will not stand his ground,\nThe swift of foot\
      \ will not escape,\nNor will the one who rides the horse save his life.\n"
    16: ¹⁶ Even the bravest among the warriors will flee naked on that day,” declares
      the Lord.
  3:
    1: "¹ Hear this word which the Lord has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against\
      \ the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt: \n"
    2: "² “You only have I known among all the families of the earth;\nTherefore I\
      \ will punish you for all your wrongdoing.”\n"
    3: "³ Do two people walk together unless they have agreed to meet?\n"
    4: "⁴ Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey?\nDoes a young lion growl\
      \ from his den unless he has captured something?\n"
    5: "⁵ Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no device in it?\n\
      Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all?\n"
    6: "⁶ If a trumpet is blown in a city, will the people not tremble?\nIf a disaster\
      \ occurs in a city, has the Lord not brought it about?\n"
    7: "⁷ Certainly the Lord God does nothing\nUnless He reveals His secret plan\n\
      To His servants the prophets.\n"
    8: "⁸ A lion has roared! Who will not fear?\nThe Lord God has spoken! Who can\
      \ do anything but prophesy? \n"
    9: '⁹ Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt
      and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see the great
      panic within her and the oppressions in her midst. '
    10: "¹⁰ But they do not know how to do what is right,” declares the Lord, “these\
      \ who store up violence and devastation in their citadels.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:\n“An enemy, one surrounding\
      \ the land,\nWill take down your fortifications from you,\nAnd your citadels\
      \ will be looted.” \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion’s\
      \ mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear,\nSo will the sons of Israel living\
      \ in Samaria be snatched away—\nWith the corner of a bed and the cover of a\
      \ couch!\n"
    13: "¹³ Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,”\nDeclares the Lord God,\
      \ the God of armies.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “For on the day that I punish Israel’s offenses,\nI will also punish the\
      \ altars of Bethel;\nThe horns of the altar will be cut off,\nAnd will fall\
      \ to the ground.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house;\n\
      The houses of ivory will also perish,\nAnd the great houses will come to an\
      \ end,”\nDeclares the Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, you cows of Bashan who are on the mountain of Samaria,\n\
      Who exploit the poor, who oppress the needy,\nAnd say to their husbands, “Bring\
      \ now, that we may drink!”\n"
    2: "² The Lord God has sworn by His holiness,\n“For behold, the days are coming\
      \ upon you\nWhen they will take you away with meat hooks,\nAnd the last of you\
      \ with fish hooks.\n"
    3: "³ You will go out through holes in the walls,\nOne in front of the other,\n\
      And you will be hurled to Harmon,” declares the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Enter Bethel and do wrong;\nIn Gilgal multiply wrongdoing!\nBring your\
      \ sacrifices every morning,\nYour tithes every three days.\n"
    5: "⁵ Offer a thanksgiving offering also from that which is leavened,\nAnd proclaim\
      \ voluntary offerings, make them known.\nFor so you love to do, you sons of\
      \ Israel,”\nDeclares the Lord God. \n"
    6: "⁶ “But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\nAnd lack of\
      \ bread in all your places;\nYet you have not returned to Me,” declares the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    7: "⁷ “Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you\nWhile there were still three\
      \ months until harvest.\nThen I would send rain on one city,\nBut on another\
      \ city I would not send rain;\nOne part would be rained on,\nWhile the part\
      \ not rained on would dry up.\n"
    8: "⁸ So the people of two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink\
      \ water,\nBut would not be satisfied;\nYet you have not returned to Me,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    9: "⁹ “I struck you with scorching wind and mildew;\nThe caterpillar was devouring\n\
      Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees;\nYet you have not\
      \ returned to Me,” declares the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “I sent a plague among you as in Egypt;\nI killed your young men with\
      \ the sword, along with your captured horses,\nAnd I made the stench of your\
      \ camp rise up in your nostrils;\nYet you have not returned to Me,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    11: "¹¹ “I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,\nAnd you were like\
      \ a log snatched from a fire;\nYet you have not returned to Me,” declares the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore so I will do to you, Israel;\nBecause I will do this to you,\n\
      Prepare to meet your God, Israel.”\n"
    13: "¹³ For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind,\nAnd declares\
      \ to a person what are His thoughts,\nHe who makes dawn into darkness\nAnd treads\
      \ on the high places of the earth,\nThe Lord God of armies is His name."
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this word which I am taking up for you as a song of mourning, house\
      \ of Israel:\n"
    2: "² She has fallen, she will not rise again—\nThe virgin Israel.\nShe lies unnoticed\
      \ on her land;\nThere is no one to raise her up. \n"
    3: "³ For this is what the Lord God says:\n“The city which goes forth a thousand\
      \ strong\nWill have a hundred left,\nAnd the one which goes forth a hundred\
      \ strong\nWill have ten left to the house of Israel.” \n"
    4: "⁴ For this is what the Lord says to the house of Israel:\n“Seek Me so that\
      \ you may live.\n"
    5: "⁵ But do not resort to Bethel\nAnd do not come to Gilgal,\nNor cross over\
      \ to Beersheba;\nFor Gilgal will certainly go into captivity\nAnd Bethel will\
      \ come to nothing.\n"
    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord so that you may live,\nOr He will break through like a fire,\
      \ house of Joseph,\nAnd it will consume with no one to extinguish it for Bethel,\n"
    7: "⁷ For those who turn justice into wormwood,\nAnd throw righteousness to the\
      \ earth.” \n"
    8: "⁸ He who made the Pleiades and Orion,\nAnd changes deep darkness into morning,\n\
      Who also darkens day into night,\nWho calls for the waters of the sea\nAnd pours\
      \ them out on the surface of the earth,\nThe Lord is His name.\n"
    9: "⁹ It is He who makes destruction flash upon the strong,\nSo that destruction\
      \ comes upon the fortress. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They hate him who rebukes in the gate,\nAnd they despise him who speaks\
      \ with integrity.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor\nAnd take a tribute\
      \ of grain from them,\nThough you have built houses of cut stone,\nYet you will\
      \ not live in them;\nYou have planted beautiful vineyards, yet you will not\
      \ drink their wine.\n"
    12: "¹² For I know your offenses are many and your sins are great,\nYou who are\
      \ hostile to the righteous and accept bribes,\nAnd turn away the poor from justice\
      \ at the gate.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps quiet, because it is\
      \ an evil time. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seek good and not evil, so that you may live;\nAnd so may the Lord God\
      \ of armies be with you,\nJust as you have said!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hate evil, love good,\nAnd establish justice in the gate!\nPerhaps the\
      \ Lord God of armies\nWill be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore this is what the Lord God of armies, the Lord says:\n“There\
      \ is mourning in all the public squares,\nAnd in all the streets they say, ‘Oh\
      \ no! Oh no!’\nThey also call the farmer to mourning\nAnd professional mourners\
      \ to mourning rites.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And in all the vineyards there is mourning,\nBecause I will pass through\
      \ the midst of you,” says the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to you who are longing for the day of the Lord,\nFor what purpose\
      \ will the day of the Lord be to you?\nIt will be darkness and not light;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ As when a man flees from a lion\nAnd a bear confronts him,\nOr he goes\
      \ home, leans with his hand against the wall,\nAnd a snake bites him.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Will the day of the Lord not be darkness instead of light,\nEven gloom\
      \ with no brightness in it? \n"
    21: "²¹ “I hate, I reject your festivals,\nNor do I delight in your festive assemblies.\n"
    22: "²² Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,\n\
      I will not accept them;\nAnd I will not even look at the peace offerings of\
      \ your fattened oxen.\n"
    23: "²³ Take away from Me the noise of your songs;\nI will not even listen to\
      \ the sound of your harps.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But let justice roll out like waters,\nAnd righteousness like an ever-flowing\
      \ stream. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness
      for forty years, house of Israel? '
    26: '²⁶ You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the
      star of your gods which you made for yourselves. '
    27: ²⁷ Therefore I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord,
      whose name is the God of armies.
  6:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who are carefree in Zion,\nAnd to those who feel secure on\
      \ the mountain of Samaria,\nThe dignitaries of the foremost of nations,\nTo\
      \ whom the house of Israel comes.\n"
    2: "² Go over to Calneh and look,\nAnd go from there to Hamath the great,\nThen\
      \ go down to Gath of the Philistines.\nAre they better than these kingdoms,\n\
      Or is their territory greater than yours?\n"
    3: "³ Are you postponing the day of disaster,\nAnd would you bring near the seat\
      \ of violence? \n"
    4: "⁴ Those who lie on beds of ivory,\nAnd lounge around on their couches,\nAnd\
      \ eat lambs from the flock,\nAnd calves from the midst of the fattened cattle,\n"
    5: "⁵ Who improvise to the sound of the harp,\nAnd like David have composed songs\
      \ for themselves,\n"
    6: "⁶ Who drink wine from sacred bowls\nWhile they anoint themselves with the\
      \ finest of oils—\nYet they have not grieved over the collapse of Joseph.\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles,\nAnd the\
      \ revelry of those who lounge around will come to an end. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord God has sworn by Himself, the Lord God of armies has declared:\n\
      “I loathe the arrogance of Jacob,\nAnd detest his citadels;\nTherefore I will\
      \ give up the city and all it contains.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then one’s uncle, or his undertaker, will lift him up to carry out his
      bones from the house, and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part
      of the house, “Is anyone else with you?” And that one will say, “No one.” Then
      he will answer, “Keep quiet! For the name of the Lord is not to be mentioned.” '
    11: "¹¹ For behold, the Lord is going to command that the great house be smashed\
      \ to pieces, and the small house to rubble. \n"
    12: "¹² Do horses run on rocks?\nOr does one plow them with oxen?\nYet you have\
      \ turned justice into poison,\nAnd the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,\n"
    13: "¹³ You who rejoice in Lodebar,\nAnd say, “Have we not by our own strength\
      \ taken Karnaim for ourselves?”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you,\nHouse of Israel,”\
      \ declares the Lord God of armies,\n“And they will torment you from the entrance\
      \ of Hamath\nTo the brook of the Arabah.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord God showed me, and behold, He was forming a swarm
      of locusts when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop
      was after the king’s mowing. '
    2: "² And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land,\
      \ that I said,\n“Lord God, please pardon!\nHow can Jacob stand?\nFor he is small.”\n"
    3: "³ The Lord relented of this.\n“It shall not be,” said the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ So the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God was calling to contend
      with them by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farmland. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said,\n“Lord God, please stop!\nHow can Jacob stand?\nFor he is small.”\n"
    6: "⁶ The Lord relented of this.\n“This too shall not be,” said the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ So He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with
      a plumb line in His hand. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A plumb line.”\
      \ Then the Lord said,\n“Behold I am about to put a plumb line\nIn the midst\
      \ of My people Israel.\nI will not spare them any longer.\n"
    9: "⁹ The high places of Isaac will become deserted,\nAnd the sanctuaries of Israel\
      \ will be in ruins.\nThen I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with\
      \ the sword.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel,
      saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel;
      the land is unable to endure all his words. '
    11: '¹¹ For this is what Amos says: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel
      will certainly go from its land into exile.’” '
    12: '¹² Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go, you seer, flee to the land of Judah; and
      eat bread there and do your prophesying there! '
    13: "¹³ But do not prophesy at Bethel any longer, for it is a sanctuary of the\
      \ king and a royal residence.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Amos replied to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of
      a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me,
      ‘Go prophesy to My people Israel.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ So now hear the word of the Lord: you are saying, ‘You shall not prophesy
      against Israel nor shall you prophesy against the house of Isaac.’ '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘Your wife will become a prostitute
      in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land
      will be parceled up by a measuring line, and you yourself will die upon unclean
      soil. Furthermore Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’”'
  8:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord God showed me, and behold, there was a basket of summer
      fruit. '
    2: '² And He said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
      Then the Lord said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel. I will not
      spare them any longer. '
    3: "³ The songs of the palace will turn to wailing on that day,” declares the\
      \ Lord God. “The corpses will be many; in every place they will throw them out.\
      \ Hush!” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear this, you who trample the needy, to put an end to the humble of the
      land, '
    5: "⁵ saying,\n“When will the new moon be over,\nSo that we may sell grain;\n\
      And the Sabbath, so that we may open the wheat market,\nTo make the ephah smaller\
      \ and the shekel bigger,\nAnd to cheat with dishonest scales,\n"
    6: "⁶ So as to buy the helpless for money,\nAnd the needy for a pair of sandals,\n\
      And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat?” \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob,\n“Indeed, I will never forget\
      \ any of their deeds.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because of this will the land not quake,\nAnd everyone who lives in it mourn?\n\
      Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,\nAnd it will be tossed about\n\
      And subside like the Nile of Egypt.\n"
    9: "⁹ And it will come about on that day,” declares the Lord God,\n“That I will\
      \ make the sun go down at noon,\nAnd make the earth dark in broad daylight.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I will turn your festivals into mourning,\nAnd all your songs into\
      \ songs of mourning;\nAnd I will put sackcloth around everyone’s waist,\nAnd\
      \ baldness on every head.\nAnd I will make it like a time of mourning for an\
      \ only son,\nAnd the end of it will be like a bitter day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord God,\n“When I will send a\
      \ famine on the land,\nNot a famine of bread or a thirst for water,\nBut rather\
      \ for hearing the words of the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² People will stagger from sea to sea\nAnd from the north even to the east;\n\
      They will roam about to seek the word of the Lord,\nBut they will not find it.\n"
    13: "¹³ On that day the beautiful virgins\nAnd the young men will faint from thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,\nAnd say, ‘As your god\
      \ lives, Dan,’\nAnd, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’\nThey will fall and not\
      \ rise again.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,\n“Strike the pillar\
      \ capitals so that the thresholds will shake,\nAnd break them on the heads of\
      \ them all!\nThen I will put to death the rest of them with the sword;\nThey\
      \ will not have a fugitive who will flee,\nNor a survivor who will escape.\n"

      \ them.\n"
    4: "⁴ And though they go into captivity before their enemies,\nFrom there I will\
