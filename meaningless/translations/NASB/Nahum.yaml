    1: "¹ The pronouncement of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² A jealous and avenging God is the Lord;\nThe Lord is avenging and wrathful.\n\
      The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries,\nAnd He reserves wrath for His\
      \ enemies.\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,\nAnd the Lord will by no means\
      \ leave the guilty unpunished.\nIn the gale and the storm is His way,\nAnd clouds\
      \ are the dust beneath His feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ He rebukes the sea and dries it up;\nHe dries up all the rivers.\nBashan\
      \ and Carmel wither,\nThe blossoms of Lebanon wither.\n"
    5: "⁵ Mountains quake because of Him,\nAnd the hills come apart;\nIndeed the earth\
      \ is upheaved by His presence,\nThe world and all the inhabitants in it.\n"
    6: "⁶ Who can stand before His indignation?\nWho can endure the burning of His\
      \ anger?\nHis wrath gushes forth like fire,\nAnd the rocks are broken up by\
      \ Him.\n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord is good,\nA stronghold in the day of trouble,\nAnd He knows those\
      \ who take refuge in Him.\n"
    8: "⁸ But with an overflowing flood\nHe will make a complete end of its site,\n\
      And will pursue His enemies into darkness. \n"
    9: "⁹ Whatever you devise against the Lord,\nHe will make a complete end of it.\n\
      Distress will not rise up twice.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Like tangled thorns,\nAnd like those who are drunken with their drink,\n\
      They are consumed\nLike stubble completely dried up.\n"
    11: "¹¹ From you has gone out\nOne who plotted evil against the Lord,\nA wicked\
      \ counselor. \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“Though they are at full strength and so\
      \ they are many,\nSo also they will be cut off and pass away.\nThough I have\
      \ afflicted you,\nI will afflict you no longer.\n"
    13: "¹³ So now, I will break his yoke from upon you,\nAnd I will tear your shackles\
      \ to pieces.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord has issued a command concerning you:\n“Your name will no longer\
      \ be perpetuated.\nI will eliminate the carved image and the cast metal image\n\
      From the house of your gods.\nI will prepare your grave,\nFor you are contemptible.”\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news,\nWho announces\
      \ peace!\nCelebrate your feasts, Judah,\nPay your vows.\nFor never again will\
      \ the wicked one pass through you;\nHe is eliminated completely."
  2:
    1: "¹ The one who scatters has come up against you.\nKeep watch over the fortress,\
      \ watch the road;\nBind up your waist, summon all your strength.\n"
    2: "² For the Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob\nLike the splendor of Israel,\n\
      Even though destroyers have laid waste to them\nAnd ruined their vines. \n"
    3: "³ The shields of his warriors are dyed red,\nThe warriors are dressed in scarlet,\n\
      The chariots are fitted with flashing steel\nWhen he is prepared to march,\n\
      And the juniper spears are brandished.\n"
    4: "⁴ The chariots drive wildly in the streets,\nThey rush around in the public\
      \ squares;\nTheir appearance is like torches,\nThey drive back and forth like\
      \ lightning flashes.\n"
    5: "⁵ He remembers his officers;\nThey stumble in their advance,\nThey hurry to\
      \ her wall,\nAnd the mantelet is set up.\n"
    6: "⁶ The gates of the rivers are opened\nAnd the palace sways back and forth.\n"
    7: "⁷ It is set:\nShe is stripped, she is led away,\nAnd her slave women are sobbing\
      \ like the sound of doves,\nBeating their breasts. \n"
    8: "⁸ Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,\nYet they are\
      \ fleeing;\n“Stop, stop,”\nBut no one turns back.\n"
    9: "⁹ Plunder the silver,\nPlunder the gold!\nFor there is no end to the treasure—\n\
      Wealth from every kind of desirable object.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste!\nHearts are melting and\
      \ knees wobbling!\nAlso trembling is in the entire body,\nAnd all their faces\
      \ have become pale!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Where is the den of the lions\nAnd the feeding place of the young lions,\n\
      Where the lion, lioness, and lion’s cub went\nWith nothing to disturb them?\n"
    12: "¹² The lion tore enough for his cubs,\nKilled enough prey for his lionesses,\n\
      And filled his lairs with prey\nAnd his dens with torn flesh. \n"
    13: ¹³ “Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies. “I will burn up
      her chariots in smoke, and a sword will devour your young lions; I will eliminate
      your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be
      heard.”
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies and pillage;\nHer prey does\
      \ not leave.\n"
    2: "² The sound of the whip,\nThe sound of the roar of the wheel,\nGalloping horses\n\
      And bounding chariots!\n"
    3: "³ Horsemen charging,\nSwords flashing, spears gleaming,\nMany killed, a mass\
      \ of corpses,\nAnd there is no end to the dead bodies—\nThey stumble over the\
      \ dead bodies!\n"
    4: "⁴ All because of the many sexual acts of the prostitute,\nThe charming one,\
      \ the mistress of sorceries,\nWho sells nations by her sexual acts,\nAnd families\
      \ by her sorceries.\n"
    5: "⁵ “Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies;\n“And I will lift\
      \ up your skirts over your face,\nAnd show the nations your nakedness,\nAnd\
      \ the kingdoms your shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will throw filth on you\nAnd declare you worthless,\nAnd set you up as\
      \ a spectacle.\n"
    7: "⁷ And it will come about that all who see you\nWill shrink from you and say,\n\
      ‘Nineveh is devastated!\nWho will have sympathy for her?’\nWhere shall I seek\
      \ comforters for you?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you better than No-amon,\nWhich was situated by the canals of the Nile,\n\
      With water surrounding her,\nWhose rampart was the sea,\nWhose wall consisted\
      \ of the sea?\n"
    9: "⁹ Ethiopia was her might,\nEgypt too, without limits.\nPut and Lubim were\
      \ among her helpers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet she became an exile,\nShe went into captivity;\nAlso her small children\
      \ were smashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for her\
      \ honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound with shackles.\n"
    11: "¹¹ You too will become drunk,\nYou will be hidden.\nYou too will search for\
      \ a refuge from the enemy.\n"
    12: "¹² All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit—\nWhen shaken, they\
      \ fall into the eater’s mouth.\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, your people are women in your midst!\nThe gates of your land are\
      \ opened wide to your enemies;\nFire consumes your gate bars.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Draw for yourself water for a siege!\nStrengthen your fortifications!\n\
      Go into the clay and tread the mortar!\nTake hold of the brick mold!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There fire will consume you,\nThe sword will cut you down;\nIt will consume\
      \ you as the creeping locust consumes a crop.\nMultiply yourself like the creeping\
      \ locust,\nMultiply yourself like the migratory locust.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You have made your traders more numerous than the stars of heaven—\nThe\
      \ creeping locust sheds its skin and flies away.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your courtiers are like the migratory locust.\nYour officials are like\
      \ a swarm of locusts\nSettling in the stone shelters on a cold day.\nThe sun\
      \ rises and they flee,\nAnd the place where they are is not known.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria;\nYour officers are lying\
      \ down.\nYour people are scattered on the mountains\nAnd there is no one to\
      \ gather them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ There is no relief for your collapse,\nYour wound is incurable.\nAll who\
      \ hear about you\nWill clap their hands over you,\nFor upon whom has your evil\
      \ not come continually?"
