Ruth:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a
      famine in the land. And a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to reside in the land
      of Moab with his wife and his two sons. '
    2: '² The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and
      the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem
      in Judah. So they entered the land of Moab and remained there. '
    3: '³ Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. '
    4: '⁴ And they took for themselves Moabite women as wives; the name of the one
      was Orpah, and the name of the other, Ruth. And they lived there about ten years. '
    5: "⁵ Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her\
      \ two sons and her husband. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab,
      because she had heard in the land of Moab that the Lord had visited His people
      by giving them food. '
    7: '⁷ So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law
      with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. '
    8: '⁸ But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to your
      mother’s house. May the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the
      dead and with me. '
    9: '⁹ May the Lord grant that you may find a place of rest, each one in the house
      of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they raised their voices and wept. '
    10: '¹⁰ However, they said to her, “No, but we will return with you to your people.” '
    11: '¹¹ But Naomi said, “Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I
      still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? '
    12: '¹² Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said
      I have hope, if I were even to have a husband tonight and also give birth to
      sons, '
    13: "¹³ would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain\
      \ from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is much more bitter for me than for\
      \ you, because the hand of the Lord has come out against me.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And they raised their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law,\
      \ but Ruth clung to her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then she said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people
      and her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” '
    16: '¹⁶ But Ruth said, “Do not plead with me to leave you or to turn back from
      following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you sleep, I will sleep.
      Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. '
    17: '¹⁷ Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord do
      so to me, and worse, if anything but death separates me from you.” '
    18: "¹⁸ When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking\
      \ to her about it. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So they both went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come
      to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said,
      “Is this Naomi?” '
    20: '²⁰ But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty
      has dealt very bitterly with me. '
    21: "²¹ I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why do you call\
      \ me Naomi, since the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has afflicted\
      \ me?” \n"
    22: ²² So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
      who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning
      of barley harvest.
  2:
    1: '¹ Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family
      of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. '
    2: '² And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and
      glean among the ears of grain following one in whose eyes I may find favor.”
      And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” '
    3: '³ So she left and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she
      happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the
      family of Elimelech. '
    4: '⁴ Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “May the Lord
      be with you.” And they said to him, “May the Lord bless you.” '
    5: '⁵ Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young
      woman is this?” '
    6: '⁶ And the servant in charge of the reapers replied, “She is the young Moabite
      woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. '
    7: "⁷ And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the\
      \ sheaves.’ So she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has\
      \ been sitting in the house for a little while.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean
      in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but join my young
      women here. '
    9: '⁹ Keep your eyes on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed,
      I have ordered the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the
      water jars and drink from what the servants draw.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why
      have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I
      am a foreigner?” '
    11: '¹¹ Boaz replied to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after
      the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your
      father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that
      you did not previously know. '
    12: '¹² May the Lord reward your work, and may your wages be full from the Lord,
      the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” '
    13: "¹³ Then she said, “I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have\
      \ comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not\
      \ like one of your female servants.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And at mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, that you may eat of the
      bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers;
      and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some
      left. '
    15: '¹⁵ When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, “Let her
      glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. '
    16: "¹⁶ Also you are to purposely slip out for her some grain from the bundles\
      \ and leave it so that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she
      had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. '
    18: '¹⁸ And she picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw
      what she had gleaned. She also took some out and gave Naomi what she had left
      after she was satisfied. '
    19: '¹⁹ Her mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where
      did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law
      with whom she had worked, and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked
      today is Boaz.” '
    20: '²⁰ Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the Lord who
      has not withdrawn His kindness from the living and from the dead.” Again Naomi
      said to her, “The man is our relative; he is one of our redeemers.” '
    21: '²¹ Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You are to
      stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’” '
    22: '²² And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter,
      that you go out with his young women, so that others do not assault you in another
      field.” '
    23: ²³ So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz in order to glean until
      the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her
      mother-in-law.
  3:
    1: '¹ Then her mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek
      security for you, that it may go well for you? '
    2: '² Now then, is Boaz not our relative, with whose young women you were? Behold,
      he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight. '
    3: '³ Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes,
      and go down to the threshing floor; but do not reveal yourself to the man until
      he has finished eating and drinking. '
    4: '⁴ And it shall be when he lies down, that you shall take notice of the place
      where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will
      tell you what you should do.” '
    5: "⁵ And she said to her, “All that you say I will do.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her
      mother-in-law had commanded her. '
    7: '⁷ When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie
      down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his
      feet and lay down. '
    8: '⁸ And it happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and
      bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. '
    9: '⁹ So he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your slave. Now
      spread your garment over your slave, for you are a redeemer.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he said, “May you be blessed of the Lord, my daughter. You have shown
      your last kindness to be better than the first, by not going after young men,
      whether poor or rich. '
    11: '¹¹ So now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you say,
      for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. '
    12: '¹² But now, although it is true that I am a redeemer, yet there is also a
      redeemer more closely related than I. '
    13: "¹³ Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good;\
      \ let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem\
      \ you, as the Lord lives. Lie down until morning.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So she lay at his feet until morning, and got up before one person could
      recognize another; and he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came
      to the threshing floor.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Again he said, “Give me the shawl that is on you and hold it.” So she
      held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she
      went into the city. '
    16: '¹⁶ When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?”
      And she told her all that the man had done for her. '
    17: '¹⁷ She also said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said,
      ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” '
    18: ¹⁸ Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns
      out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.”
  4:
    1: '¹ Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the redeemer
      of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, “Come over here, friend, sit
      down here.” And he came over and sat down. '
    2: '² Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.”
      So they sat down. '
    3: '³ And he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab,
      has to sell the plot of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. '
    4: '⁴ So I thought that I would inform you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who are
      sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem
      it; but if not, tell me so that I may know; for there is no one except you to
      redeem it, and I am after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.” '
    5: '⁵ Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you
      must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to
      raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.” '
    6: "⁶ Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, otherwise I would\
      \ jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem it for yourself; you may have my right\
      \ of redemption, since I cannot redeem it.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption
      and the exchange of land to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and
      gave it to another; and this was the way of confirmation in Israel. '
    8: '⁸ So the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” And he removed his
      sandal. '
    9: '⁹ Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today
      that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and
      all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. '
    10: '¹⁰ Furthermore, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon,
      to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance,
      so that the name of the deceased will not be eliminated from his brothers or
      from the court of his birth place; you are witnesses today.” '
    11: '¹¹ And all the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, “We are
      witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel
      and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth
      in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem. '
    12: "¹² Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to\
      \ Judah, through the descendants whom the Lord will give you by this young woman.”\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he had relations with
      her. And the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the Lord who has not left you
      without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ May he also be to you one who restores life and sustains your old age;\
      \ for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons,\
      \ has given birth to him.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse. '
    17: "¹⁷ And the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to\
      \ Naomi!” So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron, '
    19: '¹⁹ Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab, '
    20: '²⁰ and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon, '
    21: '²¹ and Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed, '
    22: ²² and Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
