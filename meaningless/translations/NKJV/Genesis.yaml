Genesis:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. '
    2: "² The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the\
      \ deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. \n"
    3: '³ Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. '
    4: '⁴ And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from
      the darkness. '
    5: "⁵ God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening\
      \ and the morning were the first day. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
      let it divide the waters from the waters.” '
    7: '⁷ Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the
      firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. '
    8: "⁸ And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were\
      \ the second day. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into
      one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. '
    10: "¹⁰ And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters\
      \ He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields
      seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed
      is in itself, on the earth”; and it was so. '
    12: '¹² And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according
      to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according
      to its kind. And God saw that it was good. '
    13: "¹³ So the evening and the morning were the third day. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to
      divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for
      days and years; '
    15: '¹⁵ and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light
      on the earth”; and it was so. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and
      the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. '
    17: '¹⁷ God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, '
    18: '¹⁸ and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
      the darkness. And God saw that it was good. '
    19: "¹⁹ So the evening and the morning were the fourth day. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures,
      and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” '
    21: '²¹ So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves,
      with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird
      according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. '
    22: '²² And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the
      waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” '
    23: "²³ So the evening and the morning were the fifth day. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according
      to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according
      to its kind”; and it was so. '
    25: "²⁵ And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according\
      \ to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind.\
      \ And God saw that it was good. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness;
      let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air,
      and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps
      on the earth.” '
    27: '²⁷ So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him;
      male and female He created them. '
    28: "²⁸ Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply;\
      \ fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over\
      \ the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which
      is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to
      you it shall be for food. '
    30: '³⁰ Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything
      that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb
      for food”; and it was so. '
    31: ³¹ Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.
      So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
  2:
    1: '¹ Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. '
    2: '² And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested
      on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. '
    3: "³ Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested\
      \ from all His work which God had created and made. \n"
    4: '⁴ This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created,
      in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, '
    5: '⁵ before any plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the
      field had grown. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and
      there was no man to till the ground; '
    6: "⁶ but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into\
      \ his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man
      whom He had formed. '
    9: "⁹ And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant\
      \ to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of\
      \ the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it parted
      and became four riverheads. '
    11: '¹¹ The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which skirts the whole
      land of Havilah, where there is gold. '
    12: '¹² And the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there. '
    13: '¹³ The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which goes around
      the whole land of Cush. '
    14: "¹⁴ The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one which goes toward\
      \ the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend
      and keep it. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden
      you may freely eat; '
    17: "¹⁷ but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for\
      \ in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will
      make him a helper comparable to him.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every
      bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And
      whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. '
    20: "²⁰ So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every\
      \ beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to\
      \ him. \n"
    21: '²¹ And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and
      He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. '
    22: "²² Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman,\
      \ and He brought her to the man. \n"
    23: "²³ And Adam said:\n“This is now bone of my bones\nAnd flesh of my flesh;\n\
      She shall be called Woman,\nBecause she was taken out of Man.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his\
      \ wife, and they shall become one flesh. \n"
    25: ²⁵ And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
  3:
    1: "¹ Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord\
      \ God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not\
      \ eat of every tree of the garden’?” \n"
    2: '² And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of
      the garden; '
    3: "³ but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has\
      \ said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. '
    5: "⁵ For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and\
      \ you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant
      to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and
      ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. '
    7: "⁷ Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were\
      \ naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. \n"
    8: "⁸ And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool\
      \ of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the\
      \ Lord God among the trees of the garden. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because\
      \ I was naked; and I hid myself.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the\
      \ tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me\
      \ of the tree, and I ate.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”\nThe\
      \ woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the Lord God said to the serpent:\n“Because you have done this,\nYou\
      \ are cursed more than all cattle,\nAnd more than every beast of the field;\n\
      On your belly you shall go,\nAnd you shall eat dust\nAll the days of your life.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will put enmity\nBetween you and the woman,\nAnd between your seed\
      \ and her Seed;\nHe shall bruise your head,\nAnd you shall bruise His heel.”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ To the woman He said:\n“I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception;\n\
      In pain you shall bring forth children;\nYour desire shall be for your husband,\n\
      And he shall rule over you.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then to Adam He said, “Because you have heeded the voice of your wife,\
      \ and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall\
      \ not eat of it’:\n“Cursed is the ground for your sake;\nIn toil you shall eat\
      \ of it\nAll the days of your life.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,\nAnd you shall\
      \ eat the herb of the field.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread\nTill you return to the\
      \ ground,\nFor out of it you were taken;\nFor dust you are,\nAnd to dust you\
      \ shall return.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all\
      \ living. \n"
    21: "²¹ Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed\
      \ them. \n"
    22: '²² Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to
      know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree
      of life, and eat, and live forever”— '
    23: '²³ therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the
      ground from which he was taken. '
    24: ²⁴ So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden
      of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the
      tree of life.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I
      have acquired a man from the Lord.” '
    2: '² Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of
      sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. '
    3: '³ And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering
      of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the
      Lord respected Abel and his offering, '
    5: "⁵ but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and\
      \ his countenance fell. \n"
    6: '⁶ So the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance
      fallen? '
    7: "⁷ If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin\
      \ lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.”\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were\
      \ in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?”\nHe said, “I do\
      \ not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries
      out to Me from the ground. '
    11: '¹¹ So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive
      your brother’s blood from your hand. '
    12: "¹² When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you.\
      \ A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.” \n"
    13: '¹³ And Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear! '
    14: "¹⁴ Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I\
      \ shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the\
      \ earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Lord said to him, “Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall\
      \ be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding\
      \ him should kill him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land
      of Nod on the east of Eden. '
    17: '¹⁷ And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built
      a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son—Enoch. '
    18: "¹⁸ To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael,\
      \ and Methushael begot Lamech. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and
      the name of the second was Zillah. '
    20: '²⁰ And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and
      have livestock. '
    21: '²¹ His brother’s name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who play
      the harp and flute. '
    22: "²² And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman\
      \ in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah. \n"
    23: "²³ Then Lamech said to his wives:\n“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;\nWives\
      \ of Lamech, listen to my speech!\nFor I have killed a man for wounding me,\n\
      Even a young man for hurting me.\n"
    24: "²⁴ If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,\nThen Lamech seventy-sevenfold.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, “For
      God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.” '
    26: ²⁶ And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he named him Enosh. Then
      men began to call on the name of the Lord.
  5:
    1: '¹ This is the book of the genealogy of Adam. In the day that God created man,
      He made him in the likeness of God. '
    2: '² He created them male and female, and blessed them and called them Mankind
      in the day they were created. '
    3: '³ And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own
      likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. '
    4: '⁴ After he begot Seth, the days of Adam were eight hundred years; and he had
      sons and daughters. '
    5: "⁵ So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and\
      \ he died. \n"
    6: '⁶ Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh. '
    7: '⁷ After he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years, and had
      sons and daughters. '
    8: "⁸ So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan. '
    10: '¹⁰ After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and
      had sons and daughters. '
    11: "¹¹ So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel. '
    13: '¹³ After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years,
      and had sons and daughters. '
    14: "¹⁴ So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared. '
    16: '¹⁶ After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years,
      and had sons and daughters. '
    17: "¹⁷ So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years;\
      \ and he died. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch. '
    19: '¹⁹ After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and had sons and
      daughters. '
    20: "²⁰ So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he\
      \ died. \n"
    21: '²¹ Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah. '
    22: '²² After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years,
      and had sons and daughters. '
    23: '²³ So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. '
    24: "²⁴ And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech. '
    26: '²⁶ After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years,
      and had sons and daughters. '
    27: "²⁷ So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years;\
      \ and he died. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and had a son. '
    29: '²⁹ And he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us concerning
      our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord has
      cursed.” '
    30: '³⁰ After he begot Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years,
      and had sons and daughters. '
    31: "³¹ So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years;\
      \ and he died. \n"
    32: ³² And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth,
      and daughters were born to them, '
    2: "² that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful;\
      \ and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. \n"
    3: '³ And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he
      is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” '
    4: "⁴ There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the\
      \ sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them.\
      \ Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
      that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. '
    6: '⁶ And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved
      in His heart. '
    7: '⁷ So the Lord said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face
      of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I
      am sorry that I have made them.” '
    8: "⁸ But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations.
      Noah walked with God. '
    10: "¹⁰ And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. '
    12: "¹² So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh\
      \ had corrupted their way on the earth. \n"
    13: '¹³ And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the
      earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them
      with the earth. '
    14: '¹⁴ Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it
      inside and outside with pitch. '
    15: '¹⁵ And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three
      hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit
      from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with
      lower, second, and third decks. '
    17: '¹⁷ And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy
      from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that
      is on the earth shall die. '
    18: '¹⁸ But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark—you,
      your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. '
    19: '¹⁹ And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every sort
      into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. '
    20: '²⁰ Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every
      creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come to you
      to keep them alive. '
    21: "²¹ And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall\
      \ gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.” \n"
    22: ²² Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.
  7:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household,
      because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation. '
    2: '² You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his
      female; two each of animals that are unclean, a male and his female; '
    3: '³ also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species
      alive on the face of all the earth. '
    4: '⁴ For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days
      and forty nights, and I will destroy from the face of the earth all living things
      that I have made.” '
    5: '⁵ And Noah did according to all that the Lord commanded him. '
    6: "⁶ Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth. \n"
    7: '⁷ So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark
      because of the waters of the flood. '
    8: '⁸ Of clean animals, of animals that are unclean, of birds, and of everything
      that creeps on the earth, '
    9: '⁹ two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded
      Noah. '
    10: '¹⁰ And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were
      on the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth
      day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken
      up, and the windows of heaven were opened. '
    12: "¹² And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights. \n"
    13: '¹³ On the very same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and
      Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark— '
    14: '¹⁴ they and every beast after its kind, all cattle after their kind, every
      creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after
      its kind, every bird of every sort. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which
      is the breath of life. '
    16: "¹⁶ So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had\
      \ commanded him; and the Lord shut him in. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted
      up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ The waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved
      about on the surface of the waters. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills
      under the whole heaven were covered. '
    20: '²⁰ The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. '
    21: '²¹ And all flesh died that moved on the earth: birds and cattle and beasts
      and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. '
    22: '²² All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, all that was
      on the dry land, died. '
    23: '²³ So He destroyed all living things which were on the face of the ground:
      both man and cattle, creeping thing and bird of the air. They were destroyed
      from the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive. '
    24: ²⁴ And the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that
      were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the
      waters subsided. '
    2: '² The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were also stopped, and
      the rain from heaven was restrained. '
    3: '³ And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end of the hundred
      and fifty days the waters decreased. '
    4: '⁴ Then the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month,
      on the mountains of Ararat. '
    5: "⁵ And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth\
      \ month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window
      of the ark which he had made. '
    7: '⁷ Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had
      dried up from the earth. '
    8: '⁸ He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from
      the face of the ground. '
    9: '⁹ But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned
      into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So
      he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself. '
    10: '¹⁰ And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from
      the ark. '
    11: '¹¹ Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked
      olive leaf was in her mouth; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from
      the earth. '
    12: "¹² So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not\
      \ return again to him anymore. \n"
    13: '¹³ And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month,
      the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth; and
      Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed the surface of the
      ground was dry. '
    14: "¹⁴ And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth\
      \ was dried. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then God spoke to Noah, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives
      with you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: birds
      and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may
      abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him. '
    19: "¹⁹ Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, and whatever creeps on\
      \ the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and
      of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. '
    21: "²¹ And the Lord smelled a soothing aroma. Then the Lord said in His heart,\
      \ “I will never again curse the ground for man’s sake, although the imagination\
      \ of man’s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living\
      \ thing as I have done. \n"
    22: "²² “While the earth remains,\nSeedtime and harvest,\nCold and heat,\nWinter\
      \ and summer,\nAnd day and night\nShall not cease.”"
  9:
    1: '¹ So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply,
      and fill the earth. '
    2: '² And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the
      earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move on the earth, and on all the
      fish of the sea. They are given into your hand. '
    3: '³ Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all
      things, even as the green herbs. '
    4: '⁴ But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. '
    5: "⁵ Surely for your lifeblood I will demand a reckoning; from the hand of every\
      \ beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every\
      \ man’s brother I will require the life of man. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Whoever sheds man’s blood,\nBy man his blood shall be shed;\nFor in the\
      \ image of God\nHe made man.\n"
    7: "⁷ And as for you, be fruitful and multiply;\nBring forth abundantly in the\
      \ earth\nAnd multiply in it.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: '
    9: '⁹ “And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your descendants
      after you, '
    10: '¹⁰ and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the cattle,
      and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every
      beast of the earth. '
    11: "¹¹ Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be\
      \ cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to\
      \ destroy the earth.” \n"
    12: '¹² And God said: “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me
      and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: '
    13: '¹³ I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant
      between Me and the earth. '
    14: '¹⁴ It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall
      be seen in the cloud; '
    15: '¹⁵ and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every
      living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to
      destroy all flesh. '
    16: '¹⁶ The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the
      everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that
      is on the earth.” '
    17: "¹⁷ And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established\
      \ between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
      And Ham was the father of Canaan. '
    19: "¹⁹ These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was\
      \ populated. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. '
    21: '²¹ Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. '
    22: '²² And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told
      his two brothers outside. '
    23: "²³ But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders,\
      \ and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were\
      \ turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness. \n"
    24: '²⁴ So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to
      him. '
    25: "²⁵ Then he said:\n“Cursed be Canaan;\nA servant of servants\nHe shall be\
      \ to his brethren.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ And he said:\n“Blessed be the Lord,\nThe God of Shem,\nAnd may Canaan\
      \ be his servant.\n"
    27: "²⁷ May God enlarge Japheth,\nAnd may he dwell in the tents of Shem;\nAnd\
      \ may Canaan be his servant.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. '
    29: ²⁹ So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
  10:
    1: "¹ Now this is the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And\
      \ sons were born to them after the flood. \n"
    2: '² The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and
      Tiras. '
    3: '³ The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. '
    4: '⁴ The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. '
    5: "⁵ From these the coastland peoples of the Gentiles were separated into their\
      \ lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into\
      \ their nations. \n"
    6: '⁶ The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. '
    7: "⁷ The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and\
      \ the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. \n"
    8: '⁸ Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth. '
    9: '⁹ He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod
      the mighty hunter before the Lord.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh,
      in the land of Shinar. '
    11: '¹¹ From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, '
    12: "¹² and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that is the principal city). \n"
    13: '¹³ Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, '
    14: "¹⁴ Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim).\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth; '
    16: '¹⁶ the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite; '
    17: '¹⁷ the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite; '
    18: '¹⁸ the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families
      of the Canaanites were dispersed. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar,
      as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as
      far as Lasha. '
    20: "²⁰ These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to\
      \ their languages, in their lands and in their nations. \n"
    21: '²¹ And children were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of
      Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder. '
    22: '²² The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. '
    24: '²⁴ Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. '
    25: '²⁵ To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days
      the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. '
    26: '²⁶ Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, '
    27: '²⁷ Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, '
    28: '²⁸ Obal, Abimael, Sheba, '
    29: '²⁹ Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. '
    30: '³⁰ And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain
      of the east. '
    31: "³¹ These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to\
      \ their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. \n"
    32: ³² These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations,
      in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after
      the flood.
  11:
    1: '¹ Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. '
    2: '² And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a
      plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. '
    3: '³ Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.”
      They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. '
    4: "⁴ And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top\
      \ is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered\
      \ abroad over the face of the whole earth.” \n"
    5: '⁵ But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men
      had built. '
    6: '⁶ And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language,
      and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will
      be withheld from them. '
    7: '⁷ Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not
      understand one another’s speech.” '
    8: '⁸ So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth,
      and they ceased building the city. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the\
      \ language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over\
      \ the face of all the earth. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This is the genealogy of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and begot
      Arphaxad two years after the flood. '
    11: "¹¹ After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons\
      \ and daughters. \n"
    12: '¹² Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah. '
    13: "¹³ After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and\
      \ begot sons and daughters. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. '
    15: "¹⁵ After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot\
      \ sons and daughters. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg. '
    17: "¹⁷ After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot\
      \ sons and daughters. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. '
    19: "¹⁹ After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot\
      \ sons and daughters. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug. '
    21: "²¹ After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot\
      \ sons and daughters. \n"
    22: '²² Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. '
    23: "²³ After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and\
      \ daughters. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah. '
    25: "²⁵ After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and\
      \ begot sons and daughters. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. \n"
    27: '²⁷ This is the genealogy of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran
      begot Lot. '
    28: '²⁸ And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the
      Chaldeans. '
    29: '²⁹ Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and
      the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah
      and the father of Iscah. '
    30: "³⁰ But Sarai was barren; she had no child. \n"
    31: '³¹ And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and
      his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they went out with them
      from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran
      and dwelt there. '
    32: ³² So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in
      Haran.
  12:
    1: "¹ Now the Lord had said to Abram:\n“Get out of your country,\nFrom your family\n\
      And from your father’s house,\nTo a land that I will show you.\n"
    2: "² I will make you a great nation;\nI will bless you\nAnd make your name great;\n\
      And you shall be a blessing.\n"
    3: "³ I will bless those who bless you,\nAnd I will curse him who curses you;\n\
      And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him.
      And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. '
    5: '⁵ Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their
      possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in
      Haran, and they departed to go to the land of Canaan. So they came to the land
      of Canaan. '
    6: "⁶ Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, as far as the terebinth\
      \ tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give
      this land.” And there he built an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. '
    8: '⁸ And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his
      tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; there he built an altar to
      the Lord and called on the name of the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ So Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to dwell
      there, for the famine was severe in the land. '
    11: '¹¹ And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said
      to Sarai his wife, “Indeed I know that you are a woman of beautiful countenance. '
    12: '¹² Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say,
      ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. '
    13: "¹³ Please say you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake,\
      \ and that I may live because of you.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman,
      that she was very beautiful. '
    15: '¹⁵ The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And
      the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house. '
    16: "¹⁶ He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, oxen, male donkeys,\
      \ male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ But the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because
      of Sarai, Abram’s wife. '
    18: '¹⁸ And Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me?
      Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? '
    19: '¹⁹ Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’? I might have taken her as my wife.
      Now therefore, here is your wife; take her and go your way.” '
    20: ²⁰ So Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away, with
      his wife and all that he had.
  13:
    1: '¹ Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and
      Lot with him, to the South. '
    2: '² Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. '
    3: '³ And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place
      where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, '
    4: "⁴ to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram\
      \ called on the name of the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. '
    6: '⁶ Now the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together,
      for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. '
    7: "⁷ And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen\
      \ of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me,
      and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are brethren. '
    9: "⁹ Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the\
      \ left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will\
      \ go to the left.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well
      watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden
      of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed
      east. And they separated from each other. '
    12: '¹² Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the
      plain and pitched his tent even as far as Sodom. '
    13: "¹³ But the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: “Lift your
      eyes now and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward,
      and westward; '
    15: '¹⁵ for all the land which you see I give to you and your descendants forever. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if
      a man could number the dust of the earth, then your descendants also could be
      numbered. '
    17: "¹⁷ Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it\
      \ to you.” \n"
    18: ¹⁸ Then Abram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the terebinth trees of
      Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the Lord.
  14:
    1: '¹ And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king
      of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, '
    2: '² that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab
      king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). '
    3: '³ All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). '
    4: "⁴ Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came
      and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in
      Shaveh Kiriathaim, '
    6: '⁶ and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is
      by the wilderness. '
    7: "⁷ Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and attacked\
      \ all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon\
      \ Tamar. \n"
    8: '⁸ And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king
      of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and joined together
      in battle in the Valley of Siddim '
    9: '⁹ against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king
      of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now the Valley of Siddim was full of asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom
      and Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains. '
    11: '¹¹ Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions,
      and went their way. '
    12: "¹² They also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son who dwelt in Sodom, and his\
      \ goods, and departed. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt
      by the terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of
      Aner; and they were allies with Abram. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his
      three hundred and eighteen trained servants who were born in his own house,
      and went in pursuit as far as Dan. '
    15: '¹⁵ He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants attacked
      them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. '
    16: "¹⁶ So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot\
      \ and his goods, as well as the women and the people. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that\
      \ is, the King’s Valley), after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and\
      \ the kings who were with him. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the
      priest of God Most High. '
    19: "¹⁹ And he blessed him and said:\n“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,\nPossessor\
      \ of heaven and earth;\n"
    20: "²⁰ And blessed be God Most High,\nWho has delivered your enemies into your\
      \ hand.”\nAnd he gave him a tithe of all. \n"
    21: "²¹ Now the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the\
      \ goods for yourself.” \n"
    22: '²² But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the Lord,
      God Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth, '
    23: '²³ that I will take nothing, from a thread to a sandal strap, and that I
      will not take anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram
      rich’— '
    24: '²⁴ except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men
      who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.”'
  15:
    1: "¹ After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying,\
      \ “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”\
      \ \n"
    2: '² But Abram said, “Lord God, what will You give me, seeing I go childless,
      and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” '
    3: "³ Then Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born\
      \ in my house is my heir!” \n"
    4: '⁴ And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This one shall not
      be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir.” '
    5: "⁵ Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count\
      \ the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your\
      \ descendants be.” \n"
    6: "⁶ And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Then He said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans,\
      \ to give you this land to inherit it.” \n"
    8: "⁸ And he said, “Lord God, how shall I know that I will inherit it?” \n"
    9: '⁹ So He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female
      goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, down the middle,
      and placed each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. '
    11: "¹¹ And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold,
      horror and great darkness fell upon him. '
    13: '¹³ Then He said to Abram: “Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers
      in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them
      four hundred years. '
    14: '¹⁴ And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall
      come out with great possessions. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried
      at a good old age. '
    16: "¹⁶ But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity\
      \ of the Amorites is not yet complete.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold,
      there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those
      pieces. '
    18: "¹⁸ On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying:\n“To your\
      \ descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river,\
      \ the River Euphrates— "
    19: '¹⁹ the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, '
    20: '²⁰ the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, '
    21: ²¹ the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
  16:
    1: '¹ Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian
      maidservant whose name was Hagar. '
    2: '² So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the Lord has restrained me from bearing
      children. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.”
      And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai. '
    3: '³ Then Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her
      to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the
      land of Canaan. '
    4: "⁴ So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had\
      \ conceived, her mistress became despised in her eyes. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong be upon you! I gave my maid into your\
      \ embrace; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became despised in her\
      \ eyes. The Lord judge between you and me.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid is in your hand; do to her as\
      \ you please.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Now the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness,
      by the spring on the way to Shur. '
    8: "⁸ And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are\
      \ you going?”\nShe said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ The Angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit
      yourself under her hand.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Angel of the Lord said to her, “I will multiply your descendants
      exceedingly, so that they shall not be counted for multitude.” '
    11: "¹¹ And the Angel of the Lord said to her:\n“Behold, you are with child,\n\
      And you shall bear a son.\nYou shall call his name Ishmael,\nBecause the Lord\
      \ has heard your affliction.\n"
    12: "¹² He shall be a wild man;\nHis hand shall be against every man,\nAnd every\
      \ man’s hand against him.\nAnd he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees;
      for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?” '
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; observe, it is between Kadesh\
      \ and Bered. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. '
    16: ¹⁶ Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
  17:
    1: '¹ When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said
      to him, “I am Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. '
    2: '² And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.” '
    3: '³ Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: '
    4: '⁴ “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of
      many nations. '
    5: '⁵ No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham;
      for I have made you a father of many nations. '
    6: '⁶ I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and
      kings shall come from you. '
    7: '⁷ And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants
      after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you
      and your descendants after you. '
    8: "⁸ Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you\
      \ are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and\
      \ I will be their God.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And God said to Abraham: “As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and
      your descendants after you throughout their generations. '
    10: '¹⁰ This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your
      descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; '
    11: '¹¹ and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall
      be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. '
    12: '¹² He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child
      in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from
      any foreigner who is not your descendant. '
    13: '¹³ He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must
      be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh\
      \ of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken\
      \ My covenant.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call
      her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. '
    16: "¹⁶ And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless\
      \ her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be from\
      \ her.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall
      a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who
      is ninety years old, bear a child?” '
    18: "¹⁸ And Abraham said to God, “Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then God said: “No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall
      call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting
      covenant, and with his descendants after him. '
    20: '²⁰ And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and
      will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve
      princes, and I will make him a great nation. '
    21: '²¹ But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to
      you at this set time next year.” '
    22: "²² Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. \n"
    23: '²³ So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all
      who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house,
      and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had
      said to him. '
    24: '²⁴ Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh
      of his foreskin. '
    25: '²⁵ And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in
      the flesh of his foreskin. '
    26: '²⁶ That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael; '
    27: ²⁷ and all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from
      a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
  18:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was
      sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. '
    2: '² So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by
      him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed
      himself to the ground, '
    3: '³ and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass
      on by Your servant. '
    4: '⁴ Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
      under the tree. '
    5: "⁵ And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh your hearts. After\
      \ that you may pass by, inasmuch as you have come to your servant.”\nThey said,\
      \ “Do as you have said.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, make ready
      three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.” '
    7: '⁷ And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young
      man, and he hastened to prepare it. '
    8: "⁸ So he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it\
      \ before them; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?”\nSo he said, “Here, in\
      \ the tent.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And He said, “I will certainly return to you according to the time of\
      \ life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son.”\n(Sarah was listening\
      \ in the tent door which was behind him.) "
    11: '¹¹ Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and Sarah had passed
      the age of childbearing. '
    12: "¹² Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old,\
      \ shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?” \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I surely
      bear a child, since I am old?’ '
    14: "¹⁴ Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return\
      \ to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid.\n\
      And He said, “No, but you did laugh!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went
      with them to send them on the way. '
    17: '¹⁷ And the Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing, '
    18: '¹⁸ since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the
      nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? '
    19: '¹⁹ For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his
      household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness
      and justice, that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him.” '
    20: '²⁰ And the Lord said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
      and because their sin is very grave, '
    21: "²¹ I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according\
      \ to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.” \n"
    22: '²² Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham
      still stood before the Lord. '
    23: '²³ And Abraham came near and said, “Would You also destroy the righteous
      with the wicked? '
    24: '²⁴ Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy
      the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it? '
    25: "²⁵ Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with\
      \ the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from\
      \ You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” \n"
    26: "²⁶ So the Lord said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\
      \ then I will spare all the place for their sakes.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then Abraham answered and said, “Indeed now, I who am but dust and ashes
      have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: '
    28: "²⁸ Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy\
      \ all of the city for lack of five?”\nSo He said, “If I find there forty-five,\
      \ I will not destroy it.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose there should be forty\
      \ found there?”\nSo He said, “I will not do it for the sake of forty.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty\
      \ should be found there?”\nSo He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ And he said, “Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the\
      \ Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?”\nSo He said, “I will not destroy\
      \ it for the sake of twenty.” \n"
    32: "³² Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more:\
      \ Suppose ten should be found there?”\nAnd He said, “I will not destroy it for\
      \ the sake of ten.” "
    33: ³³ So the Lord went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham;
      and Abraham returned to his place.
  19:
    1: '¹ Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in
      the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself
      with his face toward the ground. '
    2: "² And he said, “Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servant’s house\
      \ and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on\
      \ your way.”\nAnd they said, “No, but we will spend the night in the open square.”\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house.\
      \ Then he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old
      and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. '
    5: "⁵ And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you\
      \ tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them carnally.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Lot went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him, '
    7: '⁷ and said, “Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly! '
    8: "⁸ See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring\
      \ them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these\
      \ men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ And they said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one came in to stay here,
      and he keeps acting as a judge; now we will deal worse with you than with them.”
      So they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with
      them, and shut the door. '
    11: "¹¹ And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness,\
      \ both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your
      sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city—take them out of this
      place! '
    13: "¹³ For we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown\
      \ great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.”\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters,\
      \ and said, “Get up, get out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city!”\
      \ But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, “Arise,
      take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in
      the punishment of the city.” '
    16: '¹⁶ And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife’s hand,
      and the hands of his two daughters, the Lord being merciful to him, and they
      brought him out and set him outside the city. '
    17: "¹⁷ So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said,\
      \ “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain.\
      \ Escape to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Lot said to them, “Please, no, my lords! '
    19: '¹⁹ Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased
      your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to
      the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die. '
    20: "²⁰ See now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one;\
      \ please let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ And he said to him, “See, I have favored you concerning this thing also,
      in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken. '
    22: "²² Hurry, escape there. For I cannot do anything until you arrive there.”\n\
      Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. \n"
    23: '²³ The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar. '
    24: '²⁴ Then the Lord rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the
      Lord out of the heavens. '
    25: "²⁵ So He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the\
      \ cities, and what grew on the ground. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But his wife looked back behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood
      before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
      plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land which went up like the
      smoke of a furnace. '
    29: "²⁹ And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that\
      \ God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when\
      \ He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters
      were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters
      dwelt in a cave. '
    31: '³¹ Now the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is
      no man on the earth to come in to us as is the custom of all the earth. '
    32: '³² Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that
      we may preserve the lineage of our father.” '
    33: "³³ So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went\
      \ in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when\
      \ she arose. \n"
    34: '³⁴ It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, “Indeed
      I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and
      you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve the lineage of our father.” '
    35: "³⁵ Then they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger\
      \ arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she\
      \ arose. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. '
    37: '³⁷ The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of
      the Moabites to this day. '
    38: ³⁸ And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; he is
      the father of the people of Ammon to this day.
  20:
    1: '¹ And Abraham journeyed from there to the South, and dwelt between Kadesh
      and Shur, and stayed in Gerar. '
    2: "² Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king\
      \ of Gerar sent and took Sarah. \n"
    3: "³ But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “Indeed\
      \ you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a\
      \ man’s wife.” \n"
    4: '⁴ But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, will You slay a
      righteous nation also? '
    5: "⁵ Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she, even she herself said,\
      \ ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands\
      \ I have done this.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity
      of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I
      did not let you touch her. '
    7: "⁷ Now therefore, restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he will\
      \ pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that\
      \ you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told
      all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid. '
    9: '⁹ And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us?
      How have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great
      sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you have in view, that you have\
      \ done this thing?” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in
      this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife. '
    12: '¹² But indeed she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but
      not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. '
    13: "¹³ And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house,\
      \ that I said to her, ‘This is your kindness that you should do for me: in every\
      \ place, wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave
      them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Abimelech said, “See, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases
      you.” '
    16: "¹⁶ Then to Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces\
      \ of silver; indeed this vindicates you before all who are with you and before\
      \ everybody.” Thus she was rebuked. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his
      female servants. Then they bore children; '
    18: ¹⁸ for the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because
      of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
  21:
    1: '¹ And the Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah as
      He had spoken. '
    2: '² For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time
      of which God had spoken to him. '
    3: '³ And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore
      to him—Isaac. '
    4: '⁴ Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God
      had commanded him. '
    5: '⁵ Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. '
    6: '⁶ And Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and all who hear will laugh with
      me.” '
    7: "⁷ She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?\
      \ For I have borne him a son in his old age.” \n"
    8: "⁸ So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the\
      \ same day that Isaac was weaned. \n"
    9: '⁹ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham,
      scoffing. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for
      the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely with Isaac.” '
    11: "¹¹ And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight because of his\
      \ son. \n"
    12: '¹² But God said to Abraham, “Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because
      of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen
      to her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall be called. '
    13: "¹³ Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he\
      \ is your seed.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water;
      and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her
      away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one
      of the shrubs. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot;\
      \ for she said to herself, “Let me not see the death of the boy.” So she sat\
      \ opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And God heard the voice of the lad. Then the angel of God called to Hagar
      out of heaven, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has
      heard the voice of the lad where he is. '
    18: "¹⁸ Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him\
      \ a great nation.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and
      filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. '
    20: '²⁰ So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and
      became an archer. '
    21: "²¹ He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him\
      \ from the land of Egypt. \n"
    22: '²² And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the commander
      of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do. '
    23: "²³ Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with\
      \ me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness\
      \ that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have\
      \ dwelt.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ And Abraham said, “I will swear.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s
      servants had seized. '
    26: '²⁶ And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not
      tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.” '
    27: '²⁷ So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two
      of them made a covenant. '
    28: "²⁸ And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Then Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe\
      \ lambs which you have set by themselves?” \n"
    30: '³⁰ And he said, “You will take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they
      may be my witness that I have dug this well.” '
    31: "³¹ Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because the two of them swore\
      \ an oath there. \n"
    32: '³² Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol,
      the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. '
    33: '³³ Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on
      the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God. '
    34: ³⁴ And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.
  22:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said\
      \ to him, “Abraham!”\nAnd he said, “Here I am.” \n"
    2: "² Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and\
      \ go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of\
      \ the mountains of which I shall tell you.” \n"
    3: '³ So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two
      of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the
      burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. '
    4: '⁴ Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. '
    5: "⁵ And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and\
      \ I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his
      son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went
      together. '
    7: "⁷ But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!”\nAnd he said,\
      \ “Here I am, my son.”\nThen he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where\
      \ is the lamb for a burnt offering?” \n"
    8: "⁸ And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt\
      \ offering.” So the two of them went together. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built
      an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and
      laid him on the altar, upon the wood. '
    10: "¹⁰ And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham,\
      \ Abraham!”\nSo he said, “Here I am.” \n"
    12: "¹² And He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him;\
      \ for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your\
      \ only son, from Me.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram
      caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered
      it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. '
    14: "¹⁴ And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it\
      \ is said to this day, “In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, '
    16: '¹⁶ and said: “By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done
      this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son— '
    17: '¹⁷ blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants
      as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your
      descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. '
    18: '¹⁸ In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you
      have obeyed My voice.” '
    19: "¹⁹ So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together\
      \ to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying,
      “Indeed Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: '
    21: '²¹ Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, '
    22: '²² Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” '
    23: '²³ And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s
      brother. '
    24: ²⁴ His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash,
      and Maachah.
  23:
    1: '¹ Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of
      the life of Sarah. '
    2: "² So Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and\
      \ Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. \n"
    3: '³ Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth,
      saying, '
    4: "⁴ “I am a foreigner and a visitor among you. Give me property for a burial\
      \ place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” \n"
    5: '⁵ And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, '
    6: "⁶ “Hear us, my lord: You are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the\
      \ choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial\
      \ place, that you may bury your dead.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons
      of Heth. '
    8: '⁸ And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish that I bury my dead
      out of my sight, hear me, and meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, '
    9: "⁹ that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which is at the\
      \ end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for\
      \ a burial place among you.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered
      Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of
      his city, saying, '
    11: "¹¹ “No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that is in it;\
      \ I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people. I give it to you.\
      \ Bury your dead!” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land; '
    13: "¹³ and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying,\
      \ “If you will give it, please hear me. I will give you money for the field;\
      \ take it from me and I will bury my dead there.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, '
    15: '¹⁵ “My lord, listen to me; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver.
      What is that between you and me? So bury your dead.” '
    16: "¹⁶ And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver for\
      \ Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred\
      \ shekels of silver, currency of the merchants. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre,
      the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field,
      which were within all the surrounding borders, were deeded '
    18: "¹⁸ to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before\
      \ all who went in at the gate of his city. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field
      of Machpelah, before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. '
    20: ²⁰ So the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons
      of Heth as property for a burial place.
  24:
    1: '¹ Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham
      in all things. '
    2: '² So Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that
      he had, “Please, put your hand under my thigh, '
    3: '³ and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of
      the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the
      Canaanites, among whom I dwell; '
    4: "⁴ but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my\
      \ son Isaac.” \n"
    5: "⁵ And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow\
      \ me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ But Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the
      land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants
      I give this land,’ He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife
      for my son from there. '
    8: '⁸ And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released
      from this oath; only do not take my son back there.” '
    9: "⁹ So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore\
      \ to him concerning this matter. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, for all
      his master’s goods were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to
      the city of Nahor. '
    11: '¹¹ And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water
      at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water. '
    12: '¹² Then he said, “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success
      this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. '
    13: '¹³ Behold, here I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men
      of the city are coming out to draw water. '
    14: "¹⁴ Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your\
      \ pitcher that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your\
      \ camels a drink’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac.\
      \ And by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah,
      who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother,
      came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. '
    16: '¹⁶ Now the young woman was very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had
      known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up. '
    17: "¹⁷ And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little\
      \ water from your pitcher.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ So she said, “Drink, my lord.” Then she quickly let her pitcher down to
      her hand, and gave him a drink. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw water
      for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.” '
    20: '²⁰ Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the
      well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. '
    21: "²¹ And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the\
      \ Lord had made his journey prosperous or not. \n"
    22: '²² So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a
      golden nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing
      ten shekels of gold, '
    23: "²³ and said, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please, is there room in your\
      \ father’s house for us to lodge?” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom
      she bore to Nahor.” '
    25: "²⁵ Moreover she said to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room\
      \ to lodge.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord. '
    27: '²⁷ And he said, “Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who has not
      forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way,
      the Lord led me to the house of my master’s brethren.” '
    28: "²⁸ So the young woman ran and told her mother’s household these things. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the
      man by the well. '
    30: '³⁰ So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his
      sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying,
      “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he went to the man. And there he stood by the
      camels at the well. '
    31: "³¹ And he said, “Come in, O blessed of the Lord! Why do you stand outside?\
      \ For I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.” \n"
    32: '³² Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided
      straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the
      men who were with him. '
    33: "³³ Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have\
      \ told about my errand.”\nAnd he said, “Speak on.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. '
    35: '³⁵ The Lord has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He
      has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and
      camels and donkeys. '
    36: '³⁶ And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and
      to him he has given all that he has. '
    37: '³⁷ Now my master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my
      son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; '
    38: '³⁸ but you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife
      for my son.’ '
    39: '³⁹ And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ '
    40: '⁴⁰ But he said to me, ‘The Lord, before whom I walk, will send His angel
      with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my
      family and from my father’s house. '
    41: "⁴¹ You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for\
      \ if they will not give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’\
      \ \n"
    42: '⁴² “And this day I came to the well and said, ‘O Lord God of my master Abraham,
      if You will now prosper the way in which I go, '
    43: '⁴³ behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when
      the virgin comes out to draw water, and I say to her, “Please give me a little
      water from your pitcher to drink,” '
    44: "⁴⁴ and she says to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,”—let\
      \ her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son.’ \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ “But before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming
      out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew
      water. And I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ '
    46: '⁴⁶ And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder, and said,
      ‘Drink, and I will give your camels a drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave
      the camels a drink also. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The
      daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the nose
      ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. '
    48: '⁴⁸ And I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of
      my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of
      my master’s brother for his son. '
    49: "⁴⁹ Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if\
      \ not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.” \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing comes from the Lord;
      we cannot speak to you either bad or good. '
    51: "⁵¹ Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be your master’s\
      \ son’s wife, as the Lord has spoken.” \n"
    52: '⁵² And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he
      worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth. '
    53: "⁵³ Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing,\
      \ and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and\
      \ to her mother. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed all night.\
      \ Then they arose in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”\
      \ \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us\
      \ a few days, at least ten; after that she may go.” \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ And he said to them, “Do not hinder me, since the Lord has prospered my\
      \ way; send me away so that I may go to my master.” \n"
    57: '⁵⁷ So they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her personally.” '
    58: "⁵⁸ Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”\n\
      And she said, “I will go.” \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant
      and his men. '
    60: "⁶⁰ And they blessed Rebekah and said to her:\n“Our sister, may you become\n\
      The mother of thousands of ten thousands;\nAnd may your descendants possess\n\
      The gates of those who hate them.” \n"
    61: "⁶¹ Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed\
      \ the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed. \n"
    62: '⁶² Now Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South. '
    63: '⁶³ And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted
      his eyes and looked, and there, the camels were coming. '
    64: '⁶⁴ Then Rebekah lifted her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from
      her camel; '
    65: "⁶⁵ for she had said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field\
      \ to meet us?”\nThe servant said, “It is my master.” So she took a veil and\
      \ covered herself. \n"
    66: '⁶⁶ And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. '
    67: ⁶⁷ Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent; and he took Rebekah
      and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his
      mother’s death.
  25:
    1: '¹ Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah. '
    2: '² And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. '
    3: '³ Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim,
      and Leummim. '
    4: "⁴ And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All\
      \ these were the children of Keturah. \n"
    5: '⁵ And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. '
    6: "⁶ But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had;\
      \ and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son,\
      \ to the country of the east. \n"
    7: '⁷ This is the sum of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred
      and seventy-five years. '
    8: '⁸ Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and
      full of years, and was gathered to his people. '
    9: '⁹ And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which
      is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, '
    10: '¹⁰ the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham
      was buried, and Sarah his wife. '
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his\
      \ son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi. \n"
    12: '¹² Now this is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian,
      Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham. '
    13: '¹³ And these were the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according
      to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel,
      Mibsam, '
    14: '¹⁴ Mishma, Dumah, Massa, '
    15: '¹⁵ Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. '
    16: '¹⁶ These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their towns
      and their settlements, twelve princes according to their nations. '
    17: '¹⁷ These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven
      years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. '
    18: "¹⁸ (They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you\
      \ go toward Assyria.) He died in the presence of all his brethren. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ This is the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac. '
    20: '²⁰ Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of
      Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian. '
    21: '²¹ Now Isaac pleaded with the Lord for his wife, because she was barren;
      and the Lord granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived. '
    22: "²² But the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If all\
      \ is well, why am I like this?” So she went to inquire of the Lord. \n"
    23: "²³ And the Lord said to her:\n“Two nations are in your womb,\nTwo peoples\
      \ shall be separated from your body;\nOne people shall be stronger than the\
      \ other,\nAnd the older shall serve the younger.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, indeed there were
      twins in her womb. '
    25: '²⁵ And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; so they
      called his name Esau. '
    26: "²⁶ Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau’s heel;\
      \ so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field;
      but Jacob was a mild man, dwelling in tents. '
    28: "²⁸ And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was weary. '
    30: "³⁰ And Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I\
      \ am weary.” Therefore his name was called Edom. \n"
    31: "³¹ But Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright as of this day.” \n"
    32: "³² And Esau said, “Look, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to\
      \ me?” \n"
    33: "³³ Then Jacob said, “Swear to me as of this day.”\nSo he swore to him, and\
      \ sold his birthright to Jacob. "
    34: ³⁴ And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose,
      and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
  26:
    1: "¹ There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the\
      \ days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, in Gerar.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² Then the Lord appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt; live in
      the land of which I shall tell you. '
    3: '³ Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and
      your descendants I give all these lands, and I will perform the oath which I
      swore to Abraham your father. '
    4: '⁴ And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will
      give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of
      the earth shall be blessed; '
    5: "⁵ because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My\
      \ statutes, and My laws.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. '
    7: '⁷ And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, “She is my sister”;
      for he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” because he thought, “lest the men
      of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to behold.” '
    8: '⁸ Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech
      king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac,
      showing endearment to Rebekah his wife. '
    9: "⁹ Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Quite obviously she is your wife;\
      \ so how could you say, ‘She is my sister’?”\nIsaac said to him, “Because I\
      \ said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’ ” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people
      might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.” '
    11: "¹¹ So Abimelech charged all his people, saying, “He who touches this man\
      \ or his wife shall surely be put to death.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold;
      and the Lord blessed him. '
    13: '¹³ The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very
      prosperous; '
    14: '¹⁴ for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great
      number of servants. So the Philistines envied him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants
      had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth. '
    16: "¹⁶ And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier\
      \ than we.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar,
      and dwelt there. '
    18: "¹⁸ And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days\
      \ of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death\
      \ of Abraham. He called them by the names which his father had called them.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Also Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water
      there. '
    20: '²⁰ But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The
      water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they quarreled
      with him. '
    21: '²¹ Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also. So
      he called its name Sitnah. '
    22: "²² And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel\
      \ over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, “For now the Lord\
      \ has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.” \n"
    23: '²³ Then he went up from there to Beersheba. '
    24: '²⁴ And the Lord appeared to him the same night and said, “I am the God of
      your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply
      your descendants for My servant Abraham’s sake.” '
    25: "²⁵ So he built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord, and he\
      \ pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends,
      and Phichol the commander of his army. '
    27: "²⁷ And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and\
      \ have sent me away from you?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ But they said, “We have certainly seen that the Lord is with you. So we
      said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make
      a covenant with you, '
    29: "²⁹ that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since\
      \ we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. You\
      \ are now the blessed of the Lord.’ ” \n"
    30: '³⁰ So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. '
    31: "³¹ Then they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another;\
      \ and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. \n"
    32: '³² It came to pass the same day that Isaac’s servants came and told him about
      the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” '
    33: "³³ So he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to\
      \ this day. \n"
    34: '³⁴ When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of
      Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. '
    35: ³⁵ And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
  27:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he\
      \ could not see, that he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”\n\
      And he answered him, “Here I am.” \n"
    2: '² Then he said, “Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death. '
    3: '³ Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go
      out to the field and hunt game for me. '
    4: "⁴ And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat,\
      \ that my soul may bless you before I die.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went
      to the field to hunt game and to bring it. '
    6: '⁶ So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Indeed I heard your father speak
      to Esau your brother, saying, '
    7: '⁷ ‘Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless
      you in the presence of the Lord before my death.’ '
    8: '⁸ Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you. '
    9: '⁹ Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats,
      and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he\
      \ may bless you before his death.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, Esau my brother is a hairy
      man, and I am a smooth-skinned man. '
    12: "¹² Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him;\
      \ and I shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.” \n"
    13: '¹³ But his mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey
      my voice, and go, get them for me.” '
    14: '¹⁴ And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother
      made savory food, such as his father loved. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Rebekah took the choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which were
      with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. '
    16: '¹⁶ And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the
      smooth part of his neck. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into\
      \ the hand of her son Jacob. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ So he went to his father and said, “My father.”\nAnd he said, “Here I\
      \ am. Who are you, my son?” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just\
      \ as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless\
      \ me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly,\
      \ my son?”\nAnd he said, “Because the Lord your God brought it to me.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether
      you are really my son Esau or not.” '
    22: '²² So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The
      voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” '
    23: "²³ And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother\
      \ Esau’s hands; so he blessed him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then he said, “Are you really my son Esau?”\nHe said, “I am.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, so that
      my soul may bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought
      him wine, and he drank. '
    26: '²⁶ Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.” '
    27: "²⁷ And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing,\
      \ and blessed him and said:\n“Surely, the smell of my son\nIs like the smell\
      \ of a field\nWhich the Lord has blessed.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Therefore may God give you\nOf the dew of heaven,\nOf the fatness of the\
      \ earth,\nAnd plenty of grain and wine.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let peoples serve you,\nAnd nations bow down to you.\nBe master over your\
      \ brethren,\nAnd let your mother’s sons bow down to you.\nCursed be everyone\
      \ who curses you,\nAnd blessed be those who bless you!” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob
      had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother
      came in from his hunting. '
    31: "³¹ He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to\
      \ his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that your soul\
      \ may bless me.” \n"
    32: "³² And his father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?”\nSo he said, “I am your\
      \ son, your firstborn, Esau.” \n"
    33: "³³ Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who? Where is the one who\
      \ hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have\
      \ blessed him—and indeed he shall be blessed.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly\
      \ great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me—me also, O my father!”\
      \ \n"
    35: "³⁵ But he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ And Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me\
      \ these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away\
      \ my blessing!” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” \n"
    37: "³⁷ Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Indeed I have made him your master,\
      \ and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine\
      \ I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?” \n"
    38: "³⁸ And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless\
      \ me—me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:\n“Behold, your dwelling\
      \ shall be of the fatness of the earth,\nAnd of the dew of heaven from above.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ By your sword you shall live,\nAnd you shall serve your brother;\nAnd\
      \ it shall come to pass, when you become restless,\nThat you shall break his\
      \ yoke from your neck.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed\
      \ him, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at\
      \ hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” \n"
    42: '⁴² And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent
      and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Surely your brother Esau
      comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you. '
    43: '⁴³ Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban
      in Haran. '
    44: '⁴⁴ And stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away, '
    45: "⁴⁵ until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you\
      \ have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I\
      \ be bereaved also of you both in one day?” \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters
      of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these who are
      the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
  28:
    1: '¹ Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him:
      “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. '
    2: "² Arise, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and\
      \ take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “May God Almighty bless you,\nAnd make you fruitful and multiply you,\n\
      That you may be an assembly of peoples;\n"
    4: "⁴ And give you the blessing of Abraham,\nTo you and your descendants with\
      \ you,\nThat you may inherit the land\nIn which you are a stranger,\nWhich God\
      \ gave to Abraham.” \n"
    5: "⁵ So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of\
      \ Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to
      take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge,
      saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,” '
    7: '⁷ and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan
      Aram. '
    8: '⁸ Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac. '
    9: "⁹ So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s\
      \ son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. '
    11: '¹¹ So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the
      sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head,
      and he lay down in that place to sleep. '
    12: "¹² Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its\
      \ top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending\
      \ on it. \n"
    13: '¹³ And behold, the Lord stood above it and said: “I am the Lord God of Abraham
      your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you
      and your descendants. '
    14: '¹⁴ Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread
      abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and
      in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. '
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring\
      \ you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have\
      \ spoken to you.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this
      place, and I did not know it.” '
    17: "¹⁷ And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other\
      \ than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put
      at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city
      had been Luz previously. '
    20: '²⁰ Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and keep me in
      this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, '
    21: '²¹ so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then the Lord shall
      be my God. '
    22: ²² And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God’s house, and of
      all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.”
  29:
    1: '¹ So Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the East. '
    2: '² And he looked, and saw a well in the field; and behold, there were three
      flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. A
      large stone was on the well’s mouth. '
    3: "³ Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone\
      \ from the well’s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place\
      \ on the well’s mouth. \n"
    4: "⁴ And Jacob said to them, “My brethren, where are you from?”\nAnd they said,\
      \ “We are from Haran.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?”\nAnd they said,\
      \ “We know him.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So he said to them, “Is he well?”\nAnd they said, “He is well. And look,\
      \ his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Then he said, “Look, it is still high day; it is not time for the cattle\
      \ to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.” \n"
    8: "⁸ But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and\
      \ they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Now while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s
      sheep, for she was a shepherdess. '
    10: '¹⁰ And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s
      brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and
      rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s
      brother. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. '
    12: "¹² And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was\
      \ Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister’s
      son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him
      to his house. So he told Laban all these things. '
    14: "¹⁴ And Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed\
      \ with him for a month. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore
      serve me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” '
    16: '¹⁶ Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name
      of the younger was Rachel. '
    17: "¹⁷ Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful of form and appearance.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for\
      \ Rachel your younger daughter.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should
      give her to another man. Stay with me.” '
    20: "²⁰ So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed only a few days\
      \ to him because of the love he had for her. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled,
      that I may go in to her.” '
    22: '²² And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast. '
    23: '²³ Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and
      brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. '
    24: '²⁴ And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid. '
    25: "²⁵ So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said\
      \ to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I\
      \ served you? Why then have you deceived me?” \n"
    26: '²⁶ And Laban said, “It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger
      before the firstborn. '
    27: "²⁷ Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which\
      \ you will serve with me still another seven years.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter
      Rachel as wife also. '
    29: '²⁹ And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid. '
    30: "³⁰ Then Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than\
      \ Leah. And he served with Laban still another seven years. \n"
    31: '³¹ When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel
      was barren. '
    32: '³² So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for
      she said, “The Lord has surely looked on my affliction. Now therefore, my husband
      will love me.” '
    33: '³³ Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the Lord has
      heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this son also.” And she called
      his name Simeon. '
    34: '³⁴ She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband
      will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore
      his name was called Levi. '
    35: ³⁵ And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now I will praise the
      Lord.” Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
  30:
    1: "¹ Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister,\
      \ and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die!” \n"
    2: "² And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the\
      \ place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” \n"
    3: '³ So she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear a
      child on my knees, that I also may have children by her.” '
    4: '⁴ Then she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her. '
    5: '⁵ And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. '
    6: '⁶ Then Rachel said, “God has judged my case; and He has also heard my voice
      and given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. '
    7: '⁷ And Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. '
    8: "⁸ Then Rachel said, “With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister,\
      \ and indeed I have prevailed.” So she called his name Naphtali. \n"
    9: '⁹ When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and
      gave her to Jacob as wife. '
    10: '¹⁰ And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Leah said, “A troop comes!” So she called his name Gad. '
    12: '¹² And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. '
    13: "¹³ Then Leah said, “I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed.”\
      \ So she called his name Asher. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the\
      \ field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please\
      \ give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my\
      \ husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?”\nAnd Rachel said, “Therefore\
      \ he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet\
      \ him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my\
      \ son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. '
    18: '¹⁸ Leah said, “God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to
      my husband.” So she called his name Issachar. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. '
    20: '²⁰ And Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband
      will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name
      Zebulun. '
    21: "²¹ Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. \n"
    22: '²² Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb. '
    23: '²³ And she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.” '
    24: "²⁴ So she called his name Joseph, and said, “The Lord shall add to me another\
      \ son.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to
      Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country. '
    26: "²⁶ Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me\
      \ go; for you know my service which I have done for you.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ And Laban said to him, “Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes,
      for I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.” '
    28: "²⁸ Then he said, “Name me your wages, and I will give it.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ So Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock
      has been with me. '
    30: "³⁰ For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased to a great\
      \ amount; the Lord has blessed you since my coming. And now, when shall I also\
      \ provide for my own house?” \n"
    31: "³¹ So he said, “What shall I give you?”\nAnd Jacob said, “You shall not give\
      \ me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep\
      \ your flocks: "
    32: '³² Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the
      speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the
      spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages. '
    33: "³³ So my righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when the subject\
      \ of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among\
      \ the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is\
      \ with me.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ And Laban said, “Oh, that it were according to your word!” '
    35: '³⁵ So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted,
      all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some
      white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the
      hand of his sons. '
    36: "³⁶ Then he put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed\
      \ the rest of Laban’s flocks. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Now Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and
      chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which was
      in the rods. '
    38: '³⁸ And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters,
      in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should
      conceive when they came to drink. '
    39: '³⁹ So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth
      streaked, speckled, and spotted. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked\
      \ and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves\
      \ and did not put them with Laban’s flock. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob
      placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might
      conceive among the rods. '
    42: '⁴² But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler
      were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s. '
    43: ⁴³ Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female
      and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
  31:
    1: '¹ Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away
      all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has acquired all
      this wealth.” '
    2: '² And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and indeed it was not favorable
      toward him as before. '
    3: "³ Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to\
      \ your family, and I will be with you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock, '
    5: '⁵ and said to them, “I see your father’s countenance, that it is not favorable
      toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. '
    6: '⁶ And you know that with all my might I have served your father. '
    7: '⁷ Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God
      did not allow him to hurt me. '
    8: '⁸ If he said thus: ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks
      bore speckled. And if he said thus: ‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then
      all the flocks bore streaked. '
    9: "⁹ So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “And it happened, at the time when the flocks conceived, that I lifted
      my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks
      were streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted. '
    11: '¹¹ Then the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, ‘Jacob.’ And I said,
      ‘Here I am.’ '
    12: '¹² And He said, ‘Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the
      flocks are streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted; for I have seen all that Laban
      is doing to you. '
    13: "¹³ I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you made\
      \ a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your\
      \ family.’ ” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there still any portion
      or inheritance for us in our father’s house? '
    15: '¹⁵ Are we not considered strangers by him? For he has sold us, and also completely
      consumed our money. '
    16: "¹⁶ For all these riches which God has taken from our father are really ours\
      \ and our children’s; now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels. '
    18: '¹⁸ And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he
      had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram, to go
      to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household
      idols that were her father’s. '
    20: '²⁰ And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not
      tell him that he intended to flee. '
    21: "²¹ So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and headed\
      \ toward the mountains of Gilead. \n"
    22: '²² And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. '
    23: '²³ Then he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days’ journey,
      and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead. '
    24: "²⁴ But God had come to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to\
      \ him, “Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains,\
      \ and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead. \n"
    26: '²⁶ And Laban said to Jacob: “What have you done, that you have stolen away
      unknown to me, and carried away my daughters like captives taken with the sword? '
    27: '²⁷ Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me;
      for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp? '
    28: '²⁸ And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have
      done foolishly in so doing. '
    29: '²⁹ It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to
      me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor
      bad.’ '
    30: "³⁰ And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father’s\
      \ house, but why did you steal my gods?” \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said,
      ‘Perhaps you would take your daughters from me by force.’ '
    32: "³² With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence\
      \ of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you.” For\
      \ Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. \n"
    33: '³³ And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the two maids’
      tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered
      Rachel’s tent. '
    34: '³⁴ Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camel’s saddle,
      and sat on them. And Laban searched all about the tent but did not find them. '
    35: "³⁵ And she said to her father, “Let it not displease my lord that I cannot\
      \ rise before you, for the manner of women is with me.” And he searched but\
      \ did not find the household idols. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban, and Jacob answered and said to
      Laban: “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued
      me? '
    37: '³⁷ Although you have searched all my things, what part of your household
      things have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that
      they may judge between us both! '
    38: '³⁸ These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats
      have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock. '
    39: '³⁹ That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss
      of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. '
    40: '⁴⁰ There I was! In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night,
      and my sleep departed from my eyes. '
    41: '⁴¹ Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years
      for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my
      wages ten times. '
    42: "⁴² Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac,\
      \ had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God\
      \ has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”\
      \ \n"
    43: '⁴³ And Laban answered and said to Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters,
      and these children are my children, and this flock is my flock; all that you
      see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children
      whom they have borne? '
    44: "⁴⁴ Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be\
      \ a witness between you and me.” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Then Jacob said to his brethren, “Gather stones.” And they took stones
      and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. '
    48: '⁴⁸ And Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me this day.”
      Therefore its name was called Galeed, '
    49: '⁴⁹ also Mizpah, because he said, “May the Lord watch between you and me when
      we are absent one from another. '
    50: "⁵⁰ If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters,\
      \ although no man is with us—see, God is witness between you and me!” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ Then Laban said to Jacob, “Here is this heap and here is this pillar,
      which I have placed between you and me. '
    52: '⁵² This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not
      pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this
      pillar to me, for harm. '
    53: '⁵³ The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge
      between us.” And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren
      to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain. '
    55: ⁵⁵ And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters
      and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.
  32:
    1: '¹ So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. '
    2: "² When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp.” And he called the name\
      \ of that place Mahanaim. \n"
    3: '³ Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of
      Seir, the country of Edom. '
    4: '⁴ And he commanded them, saying, “Speak thus to my lord Esau, ‘Thus your servant
      Jacob says: “I have dwelt with Laban and stayed there until now. '
    5: "⁵ I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent\
      \ to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.” ’ ” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother
      Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” '
    7: '⁷ So Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that
      were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies. '
    8: "⁸ And he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the\
      \ other company which is left will escape.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac,
      the Lord who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your family, and I will
      deal well with you’: '
    10: '¹⁰ I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which
      You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and
      now I have become two companies. '
    11: '¹¹ Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau;
      for I fear him, lest he come and attack me and the mother with the children. '
    12: "¹² For You said, ‘I will surely treat you well, and make your descendants\
      \ as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ ” \n"
    13: '¹³ So he lodged there that same night, and took what came to his hand as
      a present for Esau his brother: '
    14: '¹⁴ two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty
      rams, '
    15: '¹⁵ thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty
      female donkeys and ten foals. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then he delivered them to the hand of his servants, every drove by itself,
      and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put some distance between
      successive droves.” '
    17: '¹⁷ And he commanded the first one, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you
      and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose
      are these in front of you?’ '
    18: '¹⁸ then you shall say, ‘They are your servant Jacob’s. It is a present sent
      to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.’ ” '
    19: '¹⁹ So he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves,
      saying, “In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; '
    20: '²⁰ and also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” For he said,
      “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will
      see his face; perhaps he will accept me.” '
    21: "²¹ So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night\
      \ in the camp. \n"
    22: '²² And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants,
      and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. '
    23: '²³ He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had. '
    24: '²⁴ Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking
      of day. '
    25: '²⁵ Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket
      of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with
      him. '
    26: "²⁶ And He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.”\nBut he said, “I will not\
      \ let You go unless You bless me!” \n"
    27: "²⁷ So He said to him, “What is your name?”\nHe said, “Jacob.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ And He said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for\
      \ you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Then Jacob asked, saying, “Tell me Your name, I pray.”\nAnd He said, “Why\
      \ is it that you ask about My name?” And He blessed him there. \n"
    30: '³⁰ So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: “For I have seen God face
      to face, and my life is preserved.” '
    31: '³¹ Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his
      hip. '
    32: ³² Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that
      shrank, which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s
      hip in the muscle that shrank.
  33:
    1: '¹ Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, Esau was coming, and with
      him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and
      the two maidservants. '
    2: '² And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children
      behind, and Rachel and Joseph last. '
    3: "³ Then he crossed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times,\
      \ until he came near to his brother. \n"
    4: '⁴ But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed
      him, and they wept. '
    5: "⁵ And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, “Who are\
      \ these with you?”\nSo he said, “The children whom God has graciously given\
      \ your servant.” "
    6: '⁶ Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down. '
    7: "⁷ And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward\
      \ Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”\nAnd\
      \ he said, “These are to find favor in the sight of my lord.” \n"
    9: "⁹ But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And Jacob said, “No, please, if I have now found favor in your sight,
      then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though
      I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me. '
    11: "¹¹ Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt\
      \ graciously with me, and because I have enough.” So he urged him, and he took\
      \ it. \n"
    12: "¹² Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before\
      \ you.” \n"
    13: '¹³ But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are weak, and
      the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive
      them hard one day, all the flock will die. '
    14: "¹⁴ Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly\
      \ at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, are able\
      \ to endure, until I come to my lord in Seir.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Esau said, “Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with\
      \ me.”\nBut he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of\
      \ my lord.” "
    16: '¹⁶ So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. '
    17: "¹⁷ And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths\
      \ for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of
      Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram; and he pitched his tent before the city. '
    19: '¹⁹ And he bought the parcel of land, where he had pitched his tent, from
      the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. '
    20: ²⁰ Then he erected an altar there and called it El Elohe Israel.
  34:
    1: '¹ Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to
      see the daughters of the land. '
    2: '² And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw
      her, he took her and lay with her, and violated her. '
    3: '³ His soul was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved
      the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman. '
    4: "⁴ So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young woman as\
      \ a wife.” \n"
    5: '⁵ And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were
      with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came. '
    6: '⁶ Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. '
    7: '⁷ And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the
      men were grieved and very angry, because he had done a disgraceful thing in
      Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done. '
    8: '⁸ But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for
      your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. '
    9: '⁹ And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters
      to yourselves. '
    10: "¹⁰ So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and\
      \ trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, “Let me find favor in
      your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. '
    12: "¹² Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what\
      \ you say to me; but give me the young woman as a wife.” \n"
    13: '¹³ But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke
      deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to
      one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us. '
    15: '¹⁵ But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we
      are, if every male of you is circumcised, '
    16: '¹⁶ then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters
      to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. '
    17: "¹⁷ But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our\
      \ daughter and be gone.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. '
    19: "¹⁹ So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in\
      \ Jacob’s daughter. He was more honorable than all the household of his father.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke
      with the men of their city, saying: '
    21: '²¹ “These men are at peace with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land
      and trade in it. For indeed the land is large enough for them. Let us take their
      daughters to us as wives, and let us give them our daughters. '
    22: '²² Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one
      people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised. '
    23: '²³ Will not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be
      ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.” '
    24: "²⁴ And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem\
      \ his son; every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two
      of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword
      and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males. '
    26: '²⁶ And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword,
      and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went out. '
    27: '²⁷ The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because
      their sister had been defiled. '
    28: '²⁸ They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the
      city and what was in the field, '
    29: "²⁹ and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took\
      \ captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me by making me\
      \ obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the\
      \ Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together\
      \ against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my household and I.” \n"
    31: ³¹ But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a harlot?”
  35:
    1: "¹ Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make\
      \ an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of\
      \ Esau your brother.” \n"
    2: '² And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away
      the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments. '
    3: '³ Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to
      God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way
      which I have gone.” '
    4: "⁴ So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the\
      \ earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth\
      \ tree which was by Shechem. \n"
    5: '⁵ And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were
      all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. '
    6: '⁶ So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan,
      he and all the people who were with him. '
    7: "⁷ And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there\
      \ God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under\
      \ the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed
      him. '
    10: '¹⁰ And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called
      Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.” So He called his name Israel. '
    11: '¹¹ Also God said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a
      nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come
      from your body. '
    12: '¹² The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants
      after you I give this land.” '
    13: '¹³ Then God went up from him in the place where He talked with him. '
    14: '¹⁴ So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar
      of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. '
    15: "¹⁵ And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance
      to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored in childbirth, and she had hard labor. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said
      to her, “Do not fear; you will have this son also.” '
    18: '¹⁸ And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called
      his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin. '
    19: '¹⁹ So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). '
    20: "²⁰ And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachel’s grave\
      \ to this day. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. '
    22: "²² And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and\
      \ lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard about it.\nNow the\
      \ sons of Jacob were twelve: "
    23: '²³ the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah,
      Issachar, and Zebulun; '
    24: '²⁴ the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin; '
    25: '²⁵ the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali; '
    26: "²⁶ and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These\
      \ were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba (that is,
      Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt. '
    28: '²⁸ Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. '
    29: ²⁹ So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, being
      old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
  36:
    1: '¹ Now this is the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom. '
    2: '² Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon
      the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; '
    3: '³ and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth. '
    4: '⁴ Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel. '
    5: "⁵ And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau\
      \ who were born to him in the land of Canaan. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of
      his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had
      gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of
      his brother Jacob. '
    7: '⁷ For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the
      land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock. '
    8: "⁸ So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom. \n"
    9: '⁹ And this is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir. '
    10: '¹⁰ These were the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife
      of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. '
    11: "¹¹ And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. \n"
    12: "¹² Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore Amalek\
      \ to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife. \n"
    13: "¹³ These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These\
      \ were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah,\
      \ the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn
      son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz, '
    16: "¹⁶ Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz\
      \ in the land of Edom. They were the sons of Adah. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ These were the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief\
      \ Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom.\
      \ These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief
      Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs who descended from Aholibamah,
      Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah. '
    19: "¹⁹ These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these were their chiefs.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ These were the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan,
      Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, '
    21: "²¹ Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons\
      \ of Seir, in the land of Edom. \n"
    22: "²² And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was Timna. \n"
    23: "²³ These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who
      found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon. '
    25: "²⁵ These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of\
      \ Anah. \n"
    26: '²⁶ These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. '
    27: '²⁷ These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. '
    28: "²⁸ These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. \n"
    29: '²⁹ These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief
      Zibeon, Chief Anah, '
    30: "³⁰ Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the\
      \ Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. \n"
    31: '³¹ Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king
      reigned over the children of Israel: '
    32: '³² Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. '
    33: '³³ And when Bela died, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place. '
    34: '³⁴ When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. '
    35: '³⁵ And when Husham died, Hadad the son of Bedad, who attacked Midian in the
      field of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith. '
    36: '³⁶ When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place. '
    37: '³⁷ And when Samlah died, Saul of Rehoboth-by-the-River reigned in his place. '
    38: '³⁸ When Saul died, Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place. '
    39: "³⁹ And when Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, Hadar reigned in his place;\
      \ and the name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter\
      \ of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families
      and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth, '
    41: '⁴¹ Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon, '
    42: '⁴² Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar, '
    43: ⁴³ Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according
      to their dwelling places in the land of their possession. Esau was the father
      of the Edomites.
  37:
    1: '¹ Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a stranger, in the land
      of Canaan. '
    2: "² This is the history of Jacob.\nJoseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding\
      \ the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the\
      \ sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them\
      \ to his father. \n"
    3: '³ Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son
      of his old age. Also he made him a tunic of many colors. '
    4: "⁴ But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his\
      \ brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him. \n"
    5: '⁵ Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him
      even more. '
    6: '⁶ So he said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: '
    7: "⁷ There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose\
      \ and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed\
      \ down to my sheaf.” \n"
    8: "⁸ And his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall\
      \ you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams\
      \ and for his words. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said,\
      \ “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and\
      \ the eleven stars bowed down to me.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him
      and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother
      and I and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?” '
    11: "¹¹ And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind. \n"
    12: '¹² Then his brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. '
    13: "¹³ And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers feeding the flock in\
      \ Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.”\nSo he said to him, “Here I am.”\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then he said to him, “Please go and see if it is well with your brothers\
      \ and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.” So he sent him out of\
      \ the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field.\
      \ And the man asked him, saying, “What are you seeking?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So he said, “I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding\
      \ their flocks.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the man said, “They have departed from here, for I heard them say,\
      \ ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them\
      \ in Dothan. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired
      against him to kill him. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then they said to one another, “Look, this dreamer is coming! '
    20: "²⁰ Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we\
      \ shall say, ‘Some wild beast has devoured him.’ We shall see what will become\
      \ of his dreams!” \n"
    21: '²¹ But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said,
      “Let us not kill him.” '
    22: "²² And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit which\
      \ is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him”—that he might deliver\
      \ him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father. \n"
    23: '²³ So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped
      Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him. '
    24: "²⁴ Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there\
      \ was no water in it. \n"
    25: '²⁵ And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked,
      and there was a company of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels,
      bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry them down to Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother
      and conceal his blood? '
    27: '²⁷ Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon
      him, for he is our brother and our flesh.” And his brothers listened. '
    28: "²⁸ Then Midianite traders passed by; so the brothers pulled Joseph up and\
      \ lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels\
      \ of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph was not in the pit;
      and he tore his clothes. '
    30: "³⁰ And he returned to his brothers and said, “The lad is no more; and I,\
      \ where shall I go?” \n"
    31: '³¹ So they took Joseph’s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the
      tunic in the blood. '
    32: "³² Then they sent the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their\
      \ father and said, “We have found this. Do you know whether it is your son’s\
      \ tunic or not?” \n"
    33: '³³ And he recognized it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has
      devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” '
    34: '³⁴ Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for
      his son many days. '
    35: "³⁵ And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused\
      \ to be comforted, and he said, “For I shall go down into the grave to my son\
      \ in mourning.” Thus his father wept for him. \n"
    36: ³⁶ Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh
      and captain of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and
      visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah. '
    2: '² And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua,
      and he married her and went in to her. '
    3: '³ So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. '
    4: '⁴ She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. '
    5: "⁵ And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah.\
      \ He was at Chezib when she bore him. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. '
    7: '⁷ But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the
      Lord killed him. '
    8: '⁸ And Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and
      raise up an heir to your brother.” '
    9: '⁹ But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when
      he went in to his brother’s wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should
      give an heir to his brother. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He killed him\
      \ also. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your\
      \ father’s house till my son Shelah is grown.” For he said, “Lest he also die\
      \ like his brothers.” And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house. \n"
    12: '¹² Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and
      Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his
      friend Hirah the Adullamite. '
    13: '¹³ And it was told Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to
      Timnah to shear his sheep.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So she took off her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil and
      wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for
      she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. '
    15: '¹⁵ When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered
      her face. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then he turned to her by the way, and said, “Please let me come in to\
      \ you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.\nSo she said,\
      \ “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And he said, “I will send a young goat from the flock.”\nSo she said,\
      \ “Will you give me a pledge till you send it?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then he said, “What pledge shall I give you?”\nSo she said, “Your signet\
      \ and cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” Then he gave them to her,\
      \ and went in to her, and she conceived by him. "
    19: "¹⁹ So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments\
      \ of her widowhood. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
      to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand, but he did not find her. '
    21: "²¹ Then he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot who\
      \ was openly by the roadside?”\nAnd they said, “There was no harlot in this\
      \ place.” \n"
    22: "²² So he returned to Judah and said, “I cannot find her. Also, the men of\
      \ the place said there was no harlot in this place.” \n"
    23: "²³ Then Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we be shamed; for\
      \ I sent this young goat and you have not found her.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying,\
      \ “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with\
      \ child by harlotry.”\nSo Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the\
      \ man to whom these belong, I am with child.” And she said, “Please determine\
      \ whose these are—the signet and cord, and staff.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ So Judah acknowledged them and said, “She has been more righteous than\
      \ I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he never knew her again.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins
      were in her womb. '
    28: '²⁸ And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand;
      and the midwife took a scarlet thread and bound it on his hand, saying, “This
      one came out first.” '
    29: '²⁹ Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out
      unexpectedly; and she said, “How did you break through? This breach be upon
      you!” Therefore his name was called Perez. '
    30: ³⁰ Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand.
      And his name was called Zerah.
  39:
    1: '¹ Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh,
      captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken
      him down there. '
    2: '² The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the
      house of his master the Egyptian. '
    3: '³ And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all
      he did to prosper in his hand. '
    4: '⁴ So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer
      of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority. '
    5: '⁵ So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and
      all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake;
      and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the
      field. '
    6: "⁶ Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what\
      \ he had except for the bread which he ate.\nNow Joseph was handsome in form\
      \ and appearance. \n"
    7: "⁷ And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast longing\
      \ eyes on Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.” \n"
    8: '⁸ But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not
      know what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my
      hand. '
    9: "⁹ There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything\
      \ from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness,\
      \ and sin against God?” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So it was, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not heed her,\
      \ to lie with her or to be with her. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do
      his work, and none of the men of the house was inside, '
    12: '¹² that she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left
      his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside. '
    13: '¹³ And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and
      fled outside, '
    14: '¹⁴ that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, “See,
      he has brought in to us a Hebrew to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me,
      and I cried out with a loud voice. '
    15: "¹⁵ And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that\
      \ he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, “The Hebrew servant
      whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; '
    18: "¹⁸ so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment\
      \ with me and fled outside.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him,
      saying, “Your servant did to me after this manner,” that his anger was aroused. '
    20: '²⁰ Then Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where
      the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison. '
    21: '²¹ But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave him favor
      in the sight of the keeper of the prison. '
    22: '²² And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners
      who were in the prison; whatever they did there, it was his doing. '
    23: ²³ The keeper of the prison did not look into anything that was under Joseph’s
      authority, because the Lord was with him; and whatever he did, the Lord made
      it prosper.
  40:
    1: '¹ It came to pass after these things that the butler and the baker of the
      king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt. '
    2: '² And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief
      baker. '
    3: '³ So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the
      prison, the place where Joseph was confined. '
    4: "⁴ And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them;\
      \ so they were in custody for a while. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in
      the prison, had a dream, both of them, each man’s dream in one night and each
      man’s dream with its own interpretation. '
    6: '⁶ And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that
      they were sad. '
    7: "⁷ So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in the custody of his lord’s\
      \ house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?” \n"
    8: "⁸ And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter\
      \ of it.”\nSo Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell\
      \ them to me, please.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “Behold,
      in my dream a vine was before me, '
    10: '¹⁰ and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms
      shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. '
    11: "¹¹ Then Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them\
      \ into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.” \n"
    12: '¹² And Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: The three branches
      are three days. '
    13: '¹³ Now within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to
      your place, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand according to the former
      manner, when you were his butler. '
    14: '¹⁴ But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to
      me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house. '
    15: "¹⁵ For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; and also I\
      \ have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to
      Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and there were three white baskets on my head. '
    17: "¹⁷ In the uppermost basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and\
      \ the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ So Joseph answered and said, “This is the interpretation of it: The three
      baskets are three days. '
    19: "¹⁹ Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and hang you\
      \ on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from you.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that
      he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief
      butler and of the chief baker among his servants. '
    21: '²¹ Then he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he placed
      the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. '
    22: '²² But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. '
    23: ²³ Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
  41:
    1: '¹ Then it came to pass, at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh had a dream;
      and behold, he stood by the river. '
    2: '² Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat;
      and they fed in the meadow. '
    3: '³ Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly
      and gaunt, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river. '
    4: '⁴ And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows.
      So Pharaoh awoke. '
    5: '⁵ He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven heads of grain came
      up on one stalk, plump and good. '
    6: '⁶ Then behold, seven thin heads, blighted by the east wind, sprang up after
      them. '
    7: '⁷ And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh
      awoke, and indeed, it was a dream. '
    8: "⁸ Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he\
      \ sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh\
      \ told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: “I remember my faults this
      day. '
    10: '¹⁰ When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the
      house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker, '
    11: '¹¹ we each had a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according
      to the interpretation of his own dream. '
    12: '¹² Now there was a young Hebrew man with us there, a servant of the captain
      of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each
      man he interpreted according to his own dream. '
    13: "¹³ And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He\
      \ restored me to my office, and he hanged him.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him quickly out
      of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. '
    15: "¹⁵ And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who\
      \ can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand\
      \ a dream, to interpret it.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh\
      \ an answer of peace.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank
      of the river. '
    18: '¹⁸ Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river, fine looking and fat; and
      they fed in the meadow. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and
      gaunt, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows. '
    21: '²¹ When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten
      them, for they were just as ugly as at the beginning. So I awoke. '
    22: '²² Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven heads came up on one stalk,
      full and good. '
    23: '²³ Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind,
      sprang up after them. '
    24: "²⁴ And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So I told this to the\
      \ magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown
      Pharaoh what He is about to do: '
    26: '²⁶ The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven
      years; the dreams are one. '
    27: '²⁷ And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them are seven years,
      and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine. '
    28: '²⁸ This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh
      what He is about to do. '
    29: '²⁹ Indeed seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of
      Egypt; '
    30: '³⁰ but after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will
      be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land. '
    31: '³¹ So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following,
      for it will be very severe. '
    32: "³² And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the thing is established\
      \ by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. \n"
    33: '³³ “Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set
      him over the land of Egypt. '
    34: '³⁴ Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, to collect
      one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years. '
    35: '³⁵ And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming,
      and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in
      the cities. '
    36: "³⁶ Then that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years\
      \ of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish\
      \ during the famine.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ So the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his
      servants. '
    38: "³⁸ And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man\
      \ in whom is the Spirit of God?” \n"
    39: '³⁹ Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this,
      there is no one as discerning and wise as you. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according
      to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” '
    41: "⁴¹ And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of\
      \ Egypt.” \n"
    42: '⁴² Then Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph’s
      hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around
      his neck. '
    43: '⁴³ And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried
      out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he set him over all the land of Egypt. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no
      man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” '
    45: "⁴⁵ And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as\
      \ a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out\
      \ over all the land of Egypt. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.
      And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the
      land of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly. '
    48: '⁴⁸ So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land
      of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food
      of the fields which surrounded them. '
    49: "⁴⁹ Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped\
      \ counting, for it was immeasurable. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom
      Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. '
    51: '⁵¹ Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: “For God has made me
      forget all my toil and all my father’s house.” '
    52: "⁵² And the name of the second he called Ephraim: “For God has caused me to\
      \ be fruitful in the land of my affliction.” \n"
    53: '⁵³ Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended, '
    54: '⁵⁴ and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. The famine
      was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. '
    55: '⁵⁵ So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh
      for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he
      says to you, do.” '
    56: '⁵⁶ The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the
      storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land
      of Egypt. '
    57: ⁵⁷ So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine
      was severe in all lands.
  42:
    1: '¹ When Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Why
      do you look at one another?” '
    2: "² And he said, “Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down\
      \ to that place and buy for us there, that we may live and not die.” \n"
    3: '³ So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. '
    4: '⁴ But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for
      he said, “Lest some calamity befall him.” '
    5: "⁵ And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for\
      \ the famine was in the land of Canaan. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now Joseph was governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the
      people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him with
      their faces to the earth. '
    7: "⁷ Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger\
      \ to them and spoke roughly to them. Then he said to them, “Where do you come\
      \ from?”\nAnd they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. '
    9: "⁹ Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said\
      \ to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy
      food. '
    11: "¹¹ We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men; your servants are not spies.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² But he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the\
      \ land.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man\
      \ in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest is with our father today,\
      \ and one is no more.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ But Joseph said to them, “It is as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ '
    15: '¹⁵ In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall
      not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. '
    16: '¹⁶ Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept
      in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether there is any truth in
      you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!” '
    17: "¹⁷ So he put them all together in prison three days. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear
      God: '
    19: '¹⁹ If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison
      house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses. '
    20: "²⁰ And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified,\
      \ and you shall not die.”\nAnd they did so. "
    21: "²¹ Then they said to one another, “We are truly guilty concerning our brother,\
      \ for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not\
      \ hear; therefore this distress has come upon us.” \n"
    22: '²² And Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do
      not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood
      is now required of us.” '
    23: '²³ But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them
      through an interpreter. '
    24: "²⁴ And he turned himself away from them and wept. Then he returned to them\
      \ again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before\
      \ their eyes. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then Joseph gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to restore
      every man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey.
      Thus he did for them. '
    26: '²⁶ So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there. '
    27: '²⁷ But as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment,
      he saw his money; and there it was, in the mouth of his sack. '
    28: "²⁸ So he said to his brothers, “My money has been restored, and there it\
      \ is, in my sack!” Then their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying\
      \ to one another, “What is this that God has done to us?” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him
      all that had happened to them, saying: '
    30: '³⁰ “The man who is lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us for
      spies of the country. '
    31: '³¹ But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. '
    32: '³² We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest
      is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.’ '
    33: '³³ Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, ‘By this I will know
      that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food
      for the famine of your households, and be gone. '
    34: "³⁴ And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not\
      \ spies, but that you are honest men. I will grant your brother to you, and\
      \ you may trade in the land.’ ” \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly each man’s
      bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles
      of money, they were afraid. '
    36: "³⁶ And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me: Joseph is\
      \ no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin. All these things\
      \ are against me.” \n"
    37: "³⁷ Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons if I do not\
      \ bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.”\
      \ \n"
    38: ³⁸ But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead,
      and he is left alone. If any calamity should befall him along the way in which
      you go, then you would bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.”
  43:
    1: '¹ Now the famine was severe in the land. '
    2: "² And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought\
      \ from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ But Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You
      shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ '
    4: '⁴ If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. '
    5: "⁵ But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us,\
      \ ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ ” \n"
    6: "⁶ And Israel said, “Why did you deal so wrongfully with me as to tell the\
      \ man whether you had still another brother?” \n"
    7: "⁷ But they said, “The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family,\
      \ saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ And we told\
      \ him according to these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say,\
      \ ‘Bring your brother down’?” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will
      arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little
      ones. '
    9: '⁹ I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If
      I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the
      blame forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this\
      \ second time.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this:
      Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present
      for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts
      and almonds. '
    12: '¹² Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that
      was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. '
    13: '¹³ Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man. '
    14: "¹⁴ And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release\
      \ your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money
      in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt; and they stood before Joseph. '
    16: '¹⁶ When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house,
      “Take these men to my home, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these
      men will dine with me at noon.” '
    17: "¹⁷ Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s\
      \ house. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house;\
      \ and they said, “It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks\
      \ the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may make a case against\
      \ us and seize us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When they drew near to the steward of Joseph’s house, they talked with
      him at the door of the house, '
    20: '²⁰ and said, “O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food; '
    21: '²¹ but it happened, when we came to the encampment, that we opened our sacks,
      and there, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full
      weight; so we have brought it back in our hand. '
    22: "²² And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not\
      \ know who put our money in our sacks.” \n"
    23: "²³ But he said, “Peace be with you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God\
      \ of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.” Then\
      \ he brought Simeon out to them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ So the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and
      they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. '
    25: "²⁵ Then they made the present ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they\
      \ heard that they would eat bread there. \n"
    26: '²⁶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their
      hand into the house, and bowed down before him to the earth. '
    27: "²⁷ Then he asked them about their well-being, and said, “Is your father well,\
      \ the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” \n"
    28: "²⁸ And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health; he is still\
      \ alive.” And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son,
      and said, “Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me?” And he said,
      “God be gracious to you, my son.” '
    30: '³⁰ Now his heart yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought
      somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there. '
    31: "³¹ Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said,\
      \ “Serve the bread.” \n"
    32: '³² So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians
      who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with
      the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. '
    33: '³³ And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and
      the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one
      another. '
    34: ³⁴ Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin’s serving was
      five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.
  44:
    1: '¹ And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks
      with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth
      of his sack. '
    2: '² Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest,
      and his grain money.” So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. '
    3: '³ As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. '
    4: '⁴ When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said
      to his steward, “Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to
      them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? '
    5: "⁵ Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed\
      \ practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.’ ” \n"
    6: '⁶ So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. '
    7: '⁷ And they said to him, “Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from
      us that your servants should do such a thing. '
    8: '⁸ Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we
      found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from
      your lord’s house? '
    9: "⁹ With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will\
      \ be my lord’s slaves.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And he said, “Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom
      it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be blameless.” '
    11: '¹¹ Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened
      his sack. '
    12: '¹² So he searched. He began with the oldest and left off with the youngest;
      and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. '
    13: "¹³ Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned\
      \ to the city. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there;
      and they fell before him on the ground. '
    15: "¹⁵ And Joseph said to them, “What deed is this you have done? Did you not\
      \ know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or\
      \ how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants;\
      \ here we are, my lord’s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.”\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose\
      \ hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace\
      \ to your father.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Judah came near to him and said: “O my lord, please let your servant
      speak a word in my lord’s hearing, and do not let your anger burn against your
      servant; for you are even like Pharaoh. '
    19: '¹⁹ My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ '
    20: '²⁰ And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of
      his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his
      mother’s children, and his father loves him.’ '
    21: '²¹ Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set
      my eyes on him.’ '
    22: '²² And we said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should
      leave his father, his father would die.’ '
    23: "²³ But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down\
      \ with you, you shall see my face no more.’ \n"
    24: '²⁴ “So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him
      the words of my lord. '
    25: '²⁵ And our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little food.’ '
    26: '²⁶ But we said, ‘We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then
      we will go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother
      is with us.’ '
    27: '²⁷ Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me
      two sons; '
    28: '²⁸ and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn to pieces”;
      and I have not seen him since. '
    29: "²⁹ But if you take this one also from me, and calamity befalls him, you shall\
      \ bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.’ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is
      not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad’s life, '
    31: '³¹ it will happen, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will
      die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father
      with sorrow to the grave. '
    32: '³² For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I
      do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father forever.’ '
    33: '³³ Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a
      slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers. '
    34: ³⁴ For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps
      I see the evil that would come upon my father?”
  45:
    1: '¹ Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him,
      and he cried out, “Make everyone go out from me!” So no one stood with him while
      Joseph made himself known to his brothers. '
    2: "² And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; does my father still live?”
      But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed in his presence. '
    4: '⁴ And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near to me.” So they came
      near. Then he said: “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. '
    5: '⁵ But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you
      sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. '
    6: '⁶ For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still
      five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting. '
    7: '⁷ And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth,
      and to save your lives by a great deliverance. '
    8: "⁸ So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father\
      \ to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land\
      \ of Egypt. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph:
      “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you
      and your children, your children’s children, your flocks and your herds, and
      all that you have. '
    11: "¹¹ There I will provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that\
      \ you have, come to poverty; for there are still five years of famine.” ’ \n"
    12: '¹² “And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it
      is my mouth that speaks to you. '
    13: "¹³ So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that\
      \ you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept
      on his neck. '
    15: "¹⁵ Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that\
      \ his brothers talked with him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers
      have come.” So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well. '
    17: '¹⁷ And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your
      animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan. '
    18: '¹⁸ Bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you
      the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now you are commanded—do this: Take carts out of the land of Egypt for
      your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come. '
    20: "²⁰ Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the best of all the land\
      \ of Egypt is yours.’ ” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them carts, according
      to the command of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey. '
    22: '²² He gave to all of them, to each man, changes of garments; but to Benjamin
      he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments. '
    23: '²³ And he sent to his father these things: ten donkeys loaded with the good
      things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for
      his father for the journey. '
    24: "²⁴ So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them,\
      \ “See that you do not become troubled along the way.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob
      their father. '
    26: '²⁶ And they told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is governor
      over all the land of Egypt.” And Jacob’s heart stood still, because he did not
      believe them. '
    27: '²⁷ But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and
      when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob
      their father revived. '
    28: ²⁸ Then Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go
      and see him before I die.”
  46:
    1: '¹ So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba,
      and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. '
    2: "² Then God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob,\
      \ Jacob!”\nAnd he said, “Here I am.” \n"
    3: '³ So He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not fear to go down to
      Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there. '
    4: "⁴ I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again;\
      \ and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father
      Jacob, their little ones, and their wives, in the carts which Pharaoh had sent
      to carry him. '
    6: '⁶ So they took their livestock and their goods, which they had acquired in
      the land of Canaan, and went to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him. '
    7: "⁷ His sons and his sons’ sons, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and\
      \ all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt. \n"
    8: '⁸ Now these were the names of the children of Israel, Jacob and his sons,
      who went to Egypt: Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. '
    10: '¹⁰ The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul,
      the son of a Canaanite woman. '
    11: '¹¹ The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. '
    12: '¹² The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and
      Onan died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron. '
    14: '¹⁴ The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. '
    15: "¹⁵ These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan Aram, with\
      \ his daughter Dinah. All the persons, his sons and his daughters, were thirty-three.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. '
    17: '¹⁷ The sons of Asher were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their
      sister. And the sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel. '
    18: "¹⁸ These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and\
      \ these she bore to Jacob: sixteen persons. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife, were Joseph and Benjamin. '
    20: '²⁰ And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom
      Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. '
    21: '²¹ The sons of Benjamin were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh,
      Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. '
    22: "²² These were the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: fourteen persons\
      \ in all. \n"
    23: '²³ The son of Dan was Hushim. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. '
    25: "²⁵ These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter,\
      \ and she bore these to Jacob: seven persons in all. \n"
    26: '²⁶ All the persons who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came from his body,
      besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, were sixty-six persons in all. '
    27: "²⁷ And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two persons.\
      \ All the persons of the house of Jacob who went to Egypt were seventy. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out before him the way
      to Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen. '
    29: "²⁹ So Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father\
      \ Israel; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck and wept on\
      \ his neck a good while. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face,\
      \ because you are still alive.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will
      go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and those of my father’s
      house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. '
    32: '³² And the men are shepherds, for their occupation has been to feed livestock;
      and they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.’ '
    33: '³³ So it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ '
    34: ³⁴ that you shall say, ‘Your servants’ occupation has been with livestock
      from our youth even till now, both we and also our fathers,’ that you may dwell
      in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”
  47:
    1: '¹ Then Joseph went and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers,
      their flocks and their herds and all that they possess, have come from the land
      of Canaan; and indeed they are in the land of Goshen.” '
    2: '² And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. '
    3: "³ Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”\nAnd they\
      \ said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.” "
    4: "⁴ And they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to dwell in the land, because your\
      \ servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the\
      \ land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land\
      \ of Goshen.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have
      come to you. '
    6: "⁶ The land of Egypt is before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in\
      \ the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know\
      \ any competent men among them, then make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and
      Jacob blessed Pharaoh. '
    8: "⁸ Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?” \n"
    9: '⁹ And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one
      hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my
      life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my
      fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.” '
    10: "¹⁰ So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession
      in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh
      had commanded. '
    12: "¹² Then Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household\
      \ with bread, according to the number in their families. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe,
      so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. '
    14: "¹⁴ And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt\
      \ and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought\
      \ the money into Pharaoh’s house. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan,\
      \ all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, for why should\
      \ we die in your presence? For the money has failed.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Joseph said, “Give your livestock, and I will give you bread for
      your livestock, if the money is gone.” '
    17: "¹⁷ So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread\
      \ in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the\
      \ donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that\
      \ year. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him,
      “We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our
      herds of livestock. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies
      and our lands. '
    19: "¹⁹ Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our\
      \ land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed,\
      \ that we may live and not die, that the land may not be desolate.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of
      the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the
      land became Pharaoh’s. '
    21: '²¹ And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of
      the borders of Egypt to the other end. '
    22: "²² Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had rations\
      \ allotted to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave\
      \ them; therefore they did not sell their lands. \n"
    23: '²³ Then Joseph said to the people, “Indeed I have bought you and your land
      this day for Pharaoh. Look, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. '
    24: "²⁴ And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth\
      \ to Pharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your\
      \ food, for those of your households and as food for your little ones.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ So they said, “You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the sight
      of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” '
    26: "²⁶ And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh\
      \ should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did\
      \ not become Pharaoh’s. \n"
    27: '²⁷ So Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they
      had possessions there and grew and multiplied exceedingly. '
    28: '²⁸ And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the length of
      Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years. '
    29: '²⁹ When the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph
      and said to him, “Now if I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand
      under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in
      Egypt, '
    30: "³⁰ but let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury\
      \ me in their burial place.”\nAnd he said, “I will do as you have said.” \n"
    31: ³¹ Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. So Israel bowed himself
      on the head of the bed.
  48:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, “Indeed your
      father is sick”; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. '
    2: '² And Jacob was told, “Look, your son Joseph is coming to you”; and Israel
      strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. '
    3: '³ Then Jacob said to Joseph: “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land
      of Canaan and blessed me, '
    4: '⁴ and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and
      I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants
      after you as an everlasting possession.’ '
    5: '⁵ And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the
      land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon,
      they shall be mine. '
    6: '⁶ Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called
      by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. '
    7: "⁷ But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land\
      \ of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath;\
      \ and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?” \n"
    9: "⁹ Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me in this\
      \ place.”\nAnd he said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” "
    10: '¹⁰ Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. Then
      Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. '
    11: "¹¹ And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; but in\
      \ fact, God has also shown me your offspring!” \n"
    12: '¹² So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his
      face to the earth. '
    13: '¹³ And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s
      left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought
      them near him. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim’s head,
      who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands
      knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. '
    15: "¹⁵ And he blessed Joseph, and said:\n“God, before whom my fathers Abraham\
      \ and Isaac walked,\nThe God who has fed me all my life long to this day,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil,\nBless the lads;\nLet my\
      \ name be named upon them,\nAnd the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;\n\
      And let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of
      Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it
      from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. '
    18: "¹⁸ And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the\
      \ firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall\
      \ become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother\
      \ shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of\
      \ nations.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will bless, saying,\
      \ ‘May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!’ ” And thus he set Ephraim before\
      \ Manasseh. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with
      you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. '
    22: ²² Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took
      from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.”
  49:
    1: "¹ And Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather together, that I may tell you\
      \ what shall befall you in the last days: \n"
    2: "² “Gather together and hear, you sons of Jacob,\nAnd listen to Israel your\
      \ father. \n"
    3: "³ “Reuben, you are my firstborn,\nMy might and the beginning of my strength,\n\
      The excellency of dignity and the excellency of power.\n"
    4: "⁴ Unstable as water, you shall not excel,\nBecause you went up to your father’s\
      \ bed;\nThen you defiled it—\nHe went up to my couch. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Simeon and Levi are brothers;\nInstruments of cruelty are in their dwelling\
      \ place.\n"
    6: "⁶ Let not my soul enter their council;\nLet not my honor be united to their\
      \ assembly;\nFor in their anger they slew a man,\nAnd in their self-will they\
      \ hamstrung an ox.\n"
    7: "⁷ Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce;\nAnd their wrath, for it is cruel!\n\
      I will divide them in Jacob\nAnd scatter them in Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise;\nYour hand shall be\
      \ on the neck of your enemies;\nYour father’s children shall bow down before\
      \ you.\n"
    9: "⁹ Judah is a lion’s whelp;\nFrom the prey, my son, you have gone up.\nHe bows\
      \ down, he lies down as a lion;\nAnd as a lion, who shall rouse him?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The scepter shall not depart from Judah,\nNor a lawgiver from between\
      \ his feet,\nUntil Shiloh comes;\nAnd to Him shall be the obedience of the people.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Binding his donkey to the vine,\nAnd his donkey’s colt to the choice vine,\n\
      He washed his garments in wine,\nAnd his clothes in the blood of grapes.\n"
    12: "¹² His eyes are darker than wine,\nAnd his teeth whiter than milk. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Zebulun shall dwell by the haven of the sea;\nHe shall become a haven\
      \ for ships,\nAnd his border shall adjoin Sidon. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Issachar is a strong donkey,\nLying down between two burdens;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He saw that rest was good,\nAnd that the land was pleasant;\nHe bowed\
      \ his shoulder to bear a burden,\nAnd became a band of slaves. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Dan shall judge his people\nAs one of the tribes of Israel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Dan shall be a serpent by the way,\nA viper by the path,\nThat bites the\
      \ horse’s heels\nSo that its rider shall fall backward.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have waited for your salvation, O Lord! \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Gad, a troop shall tramp upon him,\nBut he shall triumph at last. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Bread from Asher shall be rich,\nAnd he shall yield royal dainties. \n"
    21: "²¹ “Naphtali is a deer let loose;\nHe uses beautiful words. \n"
    22: "²² “Joseph is a fruitful bough,\nA fruitful bough by a well;\nHis branches\
      \ run over the wall.\n"
    23: "²³ The archers have bitterly grieved him,\nShot at him and hated him.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But his bow remained in strength,\nAnd the arms of his hands were made\
      \ strong\nBy the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob\n(From there is the Shepherd,\
      \ the Stone of Israel),\n"
    25: "²⁵ By the God of your father who will help you,\nAnd by the Almighty who\
      \ will bless you\nWith blessings of heaven above,\nBlessings of the deep that\
      \ lies beneath,\nBlessings of the breasts and of the womb.\n"
    26: "²⁶ The blessings of your father\nHave excelled the blessings of my ancestors,\n\
      Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.\nThey shall be on the head\
      \ of Joseph,\nAnd on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his\
      \ brothers. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;\nIn the morning he shall devour the prey,\n\
      And at night he shall divide the spoil.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father\
      \ spoke to them. And he blessed them; he blessed each one according to his own\
      \ blessing. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then he charged them and said to them: “I am to be gathered to my people;
      bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, '
    30: '³⁰ in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre in
      the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite
      as a possession for a burial place. '
    31: '³¹ There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac
      and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah. '
    32: '³² The field and the cave that is there were purchased from the sons of Heth.” '
    33: ³³ And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into
      the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
  50:
    1: '¹ Then Joseph fell on his father’s face and wept over him, and kissed him. '
    2: '² And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So
      the physicians embalmed Israel. '
    3: "³ Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those\
      \ who are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the household
      of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in
      the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, '
    5: "⁵ ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying; in my grave which\
      \ I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” Now therefore,\
      \ please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come back.’ ” \n"
    6: "⁶ And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.” \n"
    7: '⁷ So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants
      of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, '
    8: '⁸ as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house.
      Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land
      of Goshen. '
    9: "⁹ And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very\
      \ great gathering. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan,
      and they mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation. He observed
      seven days of mourning for his father. '
    11: "¹¹ And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning\
      \ at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a deep mourning of the\
      \ Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the\
      \ Jordan. \n"
    12: '¹² So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them. '
    13: '¹³ For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the
      cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the
      field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place. '
    14: "¹⁴ And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his\
      \ brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “Perhaps
      Joseph will hate us, and may actually repay us for all the evil which we did
      to him.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, “Before your father died he
      commanded, saying, '
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Thus you shall say to Joseph: “I beg you, please forgive the trespass\
      \ of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you.” ’ Now, please,\
      \ forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph\
      \ wept when they spoke to him. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said,\
      \ “Behold, we are your servants.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? '
    20: '²⁰ But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good,
      in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive. '
    21: "²¹ Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little\
      \ ones.” And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. \n"
    22: '²² So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s household. And Joseph lived
      one hundred and ten years. '
    23: "²³ Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children of\
      \ Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also brought up on Joseph’s knees. \n"
    24: '²⁴ And Joseph said to his brethren, “I am dying; but God will surely visit
      you, and bring you out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham,
      to Isaac, and to Jacob.” '
    25: '²⁵ Then Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will
      surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” '
    26: ²⁶ So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed
      him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
