Jude:
  1:
    1: "¹ Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James,\nTo those who\
      \ are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ: \n"
    2: "² Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. \n"
    3: '³ Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common
      salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly
      for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. '
    4: "⁴ For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for\
      \ this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness\
      \ and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    5: '⁵ But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having
      saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did
      not believe. '
    6: '⁶ And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own
      abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment
      of the great day; '
    7: "⁷ as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to\
      \ these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange\
      \ flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak
      evil of dignitaries. '
    9: '⁹ Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed
      about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation,
      but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” '
    10: '¹⁰ But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know
      naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. '
    11: "¹¹ Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily\
      \ in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without
      fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about
      by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the
      roots; '
    13: "¹³ raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for\
      \ whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying,
      “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, '
    15: "¹⁵ to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them\
      \ of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and\
      \ of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts;
      and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. '
    17: '¹⁷ But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles
      of our Lord Jesus Christ: '
    18: '¹⁸ how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would
      walk according to their own ungodly lusts. '
    19: "¹⁹ These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying
      in the Holy Spirit, '
    21: "²¹ keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ unto eternal life. \n"
    22: '²² And on some have compassion, making a distinction; '
    23: "²³ but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the\
      \ garment defiled by the flesh. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,\nAnd to present you\
      \ faultless\nBefore the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,\n"
    25: "²⁵ To God our Savior,\nWho alone is wise,\nBe glory and majesty,\nDominion\
      \ and power,\nBoth now and forever.\nAmen."
