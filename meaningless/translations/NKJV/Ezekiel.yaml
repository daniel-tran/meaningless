Ezekiel:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth
      day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the
      heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. '
    2: '² On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s
      captivity, '
    3: "³ the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi,\
      \ in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the Lord\
      \ was upon him there. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great
      cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness was all around it and
      radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the
      fire. '
    5: '⁵ Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this
      was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. '
    6: '⁶ Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. '
    7: '⁷ Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles
      of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. '
    8: '⁸ The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each
      of the four had faces and wings. '
    9: "⁹ Their wings touched one another. The creatures did not turn when they went,\
      \ but each one went straight forward. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of
      the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the
      face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle. '
    11: '¹¹ Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each
      one touched one another, and two covered their bodies. '
    12: "¹² And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted\
      \ to go, and they did not turn when they went. \n"
    13: '¹³ As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like
      burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among
      the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash\
      \ of lightning. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth
      beside each living creature with its four faces. '
    16: '¹⁶ The appearance of the wheels and their workings was like the color of
      beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings
      was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. '
    17: '¹⁷ When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did
      not turn aside when they went. '
    18: '¹⁸ As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims
      were full of eyes, all around the four of them. '
    19: '¹⁹ When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when
      the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. '
    20: '²⁰ Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit
      went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living
      creatures was in the wheels. '
    21: "²¹ When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those\
      \ were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them,\
      \ for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. \n"
    22: '²² The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures
      was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads. '
    23: '²³ And under the firmament their wings spread out straight, one toward another.
      Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered
      the other side of the body. '
    24: '²⁴ When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many
      waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army;
      and when they stood still, they let down their wings. '
    25: "²⁵ A voice came from above the firmament that was over their heads; whenever\
      \ they stood, they let down their wings. \n"
    26: '²⁶ And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne,
      in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness
      with the appearance of a man high above it. '
    27: '²⁷ Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the
      color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the
      appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire
      with brightness all around. '
    28: "²⁸ Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the\
      \ appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the\
      \ likeness of the glory of the Lord.\nSo when I saw it, I fell on my face, and\
      \ I heard a voice of One speaking."
  2:
    1: '¹ And He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to
      you.” '
    2: '² Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and
      I heard Him who spoke to me. '
    3: '³ And He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel,
      to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers
      have transgressed against Me to this very day. '
    4: '⁴ For they are impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and
      you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ '
    5: "⁵ As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse—for they are a rebellious\
      \ house—yet they will know that a prophet has been among them. \n"
    6: '⁶ “And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words,
      though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not
      be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious
      house. '
    7: '⁷ You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse,
      for they are rebellious. '
    8: "⁸ But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that\
      \ rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll
      of a book was in it. '
    10: ¹⁰ Then He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on
      the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
  3:
    1: '¹ Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll,
      and go, speak to the house of Israel.” '
    2: "² So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll. \n"
    3: "³ And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with\
      \ this scroll that I give you.” So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey\
      \ in sweetness. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with
      My words to them. '
    5: '⁵ For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language,
      but to the house of Israel, '
    6: '⁶ not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words
      you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened
      to you. '
    7: '⁷ But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen
      to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted. '
    8: '⁸ Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead
      strong against their foreheads. '
    9: "⁹ Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not\
      \ be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious\
      \ house.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover He said to me: “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words
      that I speak to you, and hear with your ears. '
    11: "¹¹ And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak\
      \ to them and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ whether they hear, or whether\
      \ they refuse.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous
      voice: “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place!” '
    13: '¹³ I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched
      one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous
      noise. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness,
      in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar;\
      \ and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord
      came to me, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore
      hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me: '
    18: '¹⁸ When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no
      warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life,
      that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require
      at your hand. '
    19: "¹⁹ Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness,\
      \ nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered\
      \ your soul. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits
      iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you
      did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which
      he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. '
    21: "²¹ Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not\
      \ sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also\
      \ you will have delivered your soul.” \n"
    22: "²² Then the hand of the Lord was upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise,\
      \ go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.” \n"
    23: '²³ So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the Lord
      stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my
      face. '
    24: '²⁴ Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and
      said to me: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. '
    25: '²⁵ And you, O son of man, surely they will put ropes on you and bind you
      with them, so that you cannot go out among them. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall
      be mute and not be one to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house. '
    27: ²⁷ But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to
      them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses,
      let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
  4:
    1: '¹ “You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray
      on it a city, Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound
      against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all
      around. '
    3: "³ Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between\
      \ you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and\
      \ you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ “Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel
      upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear
      their iniquity. '
    5: '⁵ For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number
      of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of
      the house of Israel. '
    6: "⁶ And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you\
      \ shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you\
      \ a day for each year. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm
      shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it. '
    8: "⁸ And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to\
      \ another till you have ended the days of your siege. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt;
      put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. During the number
      of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall
      eat it. '
    10: '¹⁰ And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day;
      from time to time you shall eat it. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to
      time you shall drink. '
    12: "¹² And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using fuel of human\
      \ waste in their sight.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then the Lord said, “So shall the children of Israel eat their defiled\
      \ bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So I said, “Ah, Lord God! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth\
      \ till now; I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor\
      \ has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then He said to me, “See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste,\
      \ and you shall prepare your bread over it.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, surely I will cut off the supply
      of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and
      shall drink water by measure and with dread, '
    17: ¹⁷ that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and
      waste away because of their iniquity.
  5:
    1: '¹ “And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, take it as a barber’s razor, and
      pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide
      the hair. '
    2: '² You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days
      of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around it
      with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter in the wind: I will draw out
      a sword after them. '
    3: '³ You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of
      your garment. '
    4: "⁴ Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire,\
      \ and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Thus says the Lord God: ‘This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst
      of the nations and the countries all around her. '
    6: '⁶ She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the
      nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that are all around
      her; for they have refused My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.’ '
    7: '⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have multiplied disobedience
      more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes
      nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations
      that are all around you’— '
    8: '⁸ therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Indeed I, even I, am against you and
      will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations. '
    9: '⁹ And I will do among you what I have never done, and the like of which I
      will never do again, because of all your abominations. '
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat\
      \ their fathers; and I will execute judgments among you, and all of you who\
      \ remain I will scatter to all the winds. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘Therefore, as I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely, because you have defiled
      My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations,
      therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any
      pity. '
    12: "¹² One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine\
      \ in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I\
      \ will scatter another third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after\
      \ them. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them,
      and I will be avenged; and they shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it
      in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that\
      \ are all around you, in the sight of all who pass by. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ ‘So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a lesson, and an astonishment to
      the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments among you in anger
      and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken. '
    16: '¹⁶ When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be
      for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine
      upon you and cut off your supply of bread. '
    17: ¹⁷ So I will send against you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave
      you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword
      against you. I, the Lord, have spoken.’ ”
  6:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy
      against them, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says
      the Lord God to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys:
      “Indeed I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high
      places. '
    4: '⁴ Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken,
      and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. '
    5: '⁵ And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols,
      and I will scatter your bones all around your altars. '
    6: '⁶ In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high
      places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate,
      your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down,
      and your works may be abolished. '
    7: "⁷ The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword
      among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. '
    9: '⁹ Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they
      are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has
      departed from Me, and by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols;
      they will loathe themselves for the evils which they committed in all their
      abominations. '
    10: "¹⁰ And they shall know that I am the Lord; I have not said in vain that I\
      \ would bring this calamity upon them.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Pound your fists and stamp your feet, and say,
      ‘Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall
      fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. '
    12: '¹² He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall
      by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus
      will I spend My fury upon them. '
    13: '¹³ Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain are among their
      idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops,
      under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet
      incense to all their idols. '
    14: ¹⁴ So I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate,
      yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling
      places. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.’ ” ’ ”
  7:
    1: '¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel:\n‘An\
      \ end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.\n"
    3: "³ Now the end has come upon you,\nAnd I will send My anger against you;\n\
      I will judge you according to your ways,\nAnd I will repay you for all your\
      \ abominations.\n"
    4: "⁴ My eye will not spare you,\nNor will I have pity;\nBut I will repay your\

    9: "⁹ ‘My eye will not spare,\nNor will I have pity;\nI will repay you according\

    10: "¹⁰ ‘Behold, the day!\nBehold, it has come!\nDoom has gone out;\nThe rod has\
      \ blossomed,\nPride has budded.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness;\nNone of them shall remain,\n\
      None of their multitude,\nNone of them;\nNor shall there be wailing for them.\n"
    12: "¹² The time has come,\nThe day draws near. \n‘Let not the buyer rejoice,\n\
      Nor the seller mourn,\nFor wrath is on their whole multitude.\n"
    13: "¹³ For the seller shall not return to what has been sold,\nThough he may\
      \ still be alive;\nFor the vision concerns the whole multitude,\nAnd it shall\
      \ not turn back;\nNo one will strengthen himself\nWho lives in iniquity. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ ‘They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready,\nBut no one goes\
      \ to battle;\nFor My wrath is on all their multitude.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sword is outside,\nAnd the pestilence and famine within.\nWhoever\
      \ is in the field\nWill die by the sword;\nAnd whoever is in the city,\nFamine\
      \ and pestilence will devour him. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains\nLike doves of\
      \ the valleys,\nAll of them mourning,\nEach for his iniquity.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Every hand will be feeble,\nAnd every knee will be as weak as water.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ They will also be girded with sackcloth;\nHorror will cover them;\nShame\
      \ will be on every face,\nBaldness on all their heads. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ ‘They will throw their silver into the streets,\nAnd their gold will be\
      \ like refuse;\nTheir silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them\n\
      In the day of the wrath of the Lord;\nThey will not satisfy their souls,\nNor\

    21: "²¹ I will give it as plunder\nInto the hands of strangers,\nAnd to the wicked\
      \ of the earth as spoil;\nAnd they shall defile it.\n"
    22: "²² I will turn My face from them,\nAnd they will defile My secret place;\n\
      For robbers shall enter it and defile it. \n"
    23: "²³ ‘Make a chain,\nFor the land is filled with crimes of blood,\nAnd the\
      \ city is full of violence.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles,\nAnd they will possess\
      \ their houses;\nI will cause the pomp of the strong to cease,\nAnd their holy\
      \ places shall be defiled.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Destruction comes;\nThey will seek peace, but there shall be none.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Disaster will come upon disaster,\nAnd rumor will be upon rumor.\nThen\
      \ they will seek a vision from a prophet;\nBut the law will perish from the\
      \ priest,\nAnd counsel from the elders. \n"
    27: "²⁷ ‘The king will mourn,\nThe prince will be clothed with desolation,\nAnd\
      \ the hands of the common people will tremble.\nI will do to them according\
      \ to their way,\nAnd according to what they deserve I will judge them;\nThen\
      \ they shall know that I am the Lord!’ ”"
  8:
    1: '¹ And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth
      day of the month, as I sat in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before
      me, that the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there. '
    2: '² Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire—from
      the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward,
      like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber. '
    3: '³ He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and
      the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions
      of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where
      the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy. '
    4: "⁴ And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that\
      \ I saw in the plain. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So\
      \ I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was\
      \ this image of jealousy in the entrance. \n"
    6: '⁶ Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing,
      the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go
      far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.” '
    7: '⁷ So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was
      a hole in the wall. '
    8: "⁸ Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into\
      \ the wall, there was a door. \n"
    9: '⁹ And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are
      doing there.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So I went in and saw, and there—every sort of creeping thing, abominable
      beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed all around on the
      walls. '
    11: '¹¹ And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of
      Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had
      a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up. '
    12: "¹² Then He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the\
      \ house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they\
      \ say, ‘The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.’ ” \n"
    13: '¹³ And He said to me, “Turn again, and you will see greater abominations
      that they are doing.” '
    14: "¹⁴ So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord’s house; and\
      \ to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you
      will see greater abominations than these.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house; and there,\
      \ at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were\
      \ about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their\
      \ faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial
      thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here?
      For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke
      Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose. '
    18: ¹⁸ Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have
      pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Let those who
      have charge over the city draw near, each with a deadly weapon in his hand.” '
    2: "² And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces\
      \ north, each with his battle-ax in his hand. One man among them was clothed\
      \ with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood\
      \ beside the bronze altar. \n"
    3: '³ Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it
      had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with
      linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn at his side; '
    4: "⁴ and the Lord said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the\
      \ midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and\
      \ cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” \n"
    5: '⁵ To the others He said in my hearing, “Go after him through the city and
      kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. '
    6: '⁶ Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but
      do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.” So
      they began with the elders who were before the temple. '
    7: "⁷ Then He said to them, “Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain.\
      \ Go out!” And they went out and killed in the city. \n"
    8: "⁸ So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell\
      \ on my face and cried out, and said, “Ah, Lord God! Will You destroy all the\
      \ remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
      great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for
      they say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see!’ '
    10: "¹⁰ And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but\
      \ I will recompense their deeds on their own head.” \n"
    11: ¹¹ Just then, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side,
      reported back and said, “I have done as You commanded me.”
  10:
    1: '¹ And I looked, and there in the firmament that was above the head of the
      cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance
      of the likeness of a throne. '
    2: "² Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the\
      \ wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the\
      \ cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched. \n"
    3: '³ Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the
      man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. '
    4: '⁴ Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and paused over the
      threshold of the temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court
      was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory. '
    5: "⁵ And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court,\
      \ like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take
      fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood
      beside the wheels. '
    7: '⁷ And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire
      that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of
      the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out. '
    8: "⁸ The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by
      one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared to have
      the color of a beryl stone. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for their appearance, all four looked alike—as it were, a wheel in
      the middle of a wheel. '
    11: '¹¹ When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did
      not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing.
      They did not turn aside when they went. '
    12: '¹² And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the
      wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around. '
    13: "¹³ As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the
      second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth
      the face of an eagle. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature I saw by
      the River Chebar. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim
      lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not
      turn from beside them. '
    17: "¹⁷ When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when one was\
      \ lifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature\
      \ was in them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and
      stood over the cherubim. '
    19: "¹⁹ And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my\
      \ sight. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at\
      \ the door of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of\
      \ Israel was above them. \n"
    20: '²⁰ This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River
      Chebar, and I knew they were cherubim. '
    21: '²¹ Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the
      hands of a man was under their wings. '
    22: ²² And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen
      by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. They each went straight
      forward.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the Lord’s
      house, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five
      men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,
      princes of the people. '
    2: '² And He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and
      give wicked counsel in this city, '
    3: '³ who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the caldron,
      and we are the meat.’ '
    4: "⁴ Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus
      says the Lord: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things
      that come into your mind. '
    6: '⁶ You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets
      with the slain.” '
    7: '⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Your slain whom you have laid in its
      midst, they are the meat, and this city is the caldron; but I shall bring you
      out of the midst of it. '
    8: '⁸ You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,” says the
      Lord God. '
    9: '⁹ “And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of
      strangers, and execute judgments on you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel.
      Then you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its
      midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel. '
    12: "¹² And you shall know that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes\
      \ nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles\
      \ which are all around you.” ’ ” \n"
    13: "¹³ Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah\
      \ died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Lord\
      \ God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    15: '¹⁵ “Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the
      house of Israel in its entirety, are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem
      have said, ‘Get far away from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a
      possession.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Although I have cast them far
      off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries,
      yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries where they have
      gone.” ’ '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will gather you from the peoples,
      assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give
      you the land of Israel.” ’ '
    18: '¹⁸ And they will go there, and they will take away all its detestable things
      and all its abominations from there. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them,
      and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, '
    20: '²⁰ that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and
      they shall be My people, and I will be their God. '
    21: "²¹ But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things\
      \ and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,”\
      \ says the Lord God. \n"
    22: '²² So the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and
      the glory of the God of Israel was high above them. '
    23: "²³ And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood\
      \ on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of
      God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went
      up from me. '
    25: ²⁵ So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the Lord had shown me.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    2: "² “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which has eyes\
      \ to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; for they are\
      \ a rebellious house. \n"
    3: '³ “Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into
      captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity
      to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they
      are a rebellious house. '
    4: '⁴ By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going
      into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go
      into captivity. '
    5: '⁵ Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through
      it. '
    6: "⁶ In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out\
      \ at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground,\
      \ for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.” \n"
    7: "⁷ So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though\
      \ going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand.\
      \ I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to
      you, ‘What are you doing?’ '
    10: '¹⁰ Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “This burden concerns the prince
      in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.” ’ '
    11: '¹¹ Say, ‘I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them;
      they shall be carried away into captivity.’ '
    12: '¹² And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder
      at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through
      it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes. '
    13: '¹³ I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare.
      I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not
      see it, though he shall die there. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all\
      \ his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the
      nations and disperse them throughout the countries. '
    16: "¹⁶ But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from\
      \ pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles\
      \ wherever they go. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling
      and anxiety. '
    19: '¹⁹ And say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: “They shall eat their bread with anxiety,
      and drink their water with dread, so that her land may be emptied of all who
      are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it. '
    20: "²⁰ Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall\
      \ become desolate; and you shall know that I am the Lord.” ’ ” \n"
    21: '²¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    22: '²² “Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land
      of Israel, which says, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’? '
    23: '²³ Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will lay this proverb
      to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.” ’ But say to
      them, ‘ “The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision. '
    24: '²⁴ For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within
      the house of Israel. '
    25: "²⁵ For I am the Lord. I speak, and the word which I speak will come to pass;\
      \ it will no more be postponed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will\
      \ say the word and perform it,” says the Lord God.’ ” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Son of man, look, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he
      sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’ '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “None of My words will
      be postponed any more, but the word which I speak will be done,” says the Lord
      God.’ ”'
  13:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say\
      \ to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear the word of the Lord!’\
      \ ” \n"
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own
      spirit and have seen nothing! '
    4: '⁴ O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts. '
    5: '⁵ You have not gone up into the gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel
      to stand in battle on the day of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ They have envisioned futility and false divination, saying, ‘Thus says the
      Lord!’ But the Lord has not sent them; yet they hope that the word may be confirmed. '
    7: "⁷ Have you not seen a futile vision, and have you not spoken false divination?\
      \ You say, ‘The Lord says,’ but I have not spoken.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Because you have spoken nonsense and
      envisioned lies, therefore I am indeed against you,” says the Lord God. '
    9: "⁹ “My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine\
      \ lies; they shall not be in the assembly of My people, nor be written in the\
      \ record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel.\
      \ Then you shall know that I am the Lord God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, ‘Peace!’
      when there is no peace—and one builds a wall, and they plaster it with untempered
      mortar— '
    11: '¹¹ say to those who plaster it with untempered mortar, that it will fall.
      There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a
      stormy wind shall tear it down. '
    12: "¹² Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is\
      \ the mortar with which you plastered it?’ ” \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore thus says the Lord God: “I will cause a stormy wind to break
      forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great
      hailstones in fury to consume it. '
    14: "¹⁴ So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered mortar,\
      \ and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered;\
      \ it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. Then you shall\
      \ know that I am the Lord. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered
      it with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, ‘The wall is no more, nor
      those who plastered it, '
    16: "¹⁶ that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and\
      \ who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,’ ” says the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people,
      who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them, '
    18: '¹⁸ and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Woe to the women who sew magic charms
      on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt
      souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive? '
    19: "¹⁹ And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for\
      \ pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive\
      \ who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I am against your magic charms
      by which you hunt souls there like birds. I will tear them from your arms, and
      let the souls go, the souls you hunt like birds. '
    21: "²¹ I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand,\
      \ and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. Then you shall know that\
      \ I am the Lord. \n"
    22: '²² “Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom
      I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that
      he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life. '
    23: ²³ Therefore you shall no longer envision futility nor practice divination;
      for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am
      the Lord.” ’ ”
  14:
    1: '¹ Now some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. '
    2: '² And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    3: "³ “Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put\
      \ before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let\
      \ Myself be inquired of at all by them? \n"
    4: '⁴ “Therefore speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Everyone
      of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before him
      what causes him to stumble into iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the
      Lord will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols, '
    5: "⁵ that I may seize the house of Israel by their heart, because they are all\
      \ estranged from Me by their idols.” ’ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Repent,
      turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations. '
    7: '⁷ For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel,
      who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before
      him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire
      of him concerning Me, I the Lord will answer him by Myself. '
    8: "⁸ I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and\
      \ I will cut him off from the midst of My people. Then you shall know that I\
      \ am the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the Lord have induced
      that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from
      among My people Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall
      be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired, '
    11: "¹¹ that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned\
      \ anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and\
      \ I may be their God,” says the Lord God.’ ” \n"
    12: '¹² The word of the Lord came again to me, saying: '
    13: '¹³ “Son of man, when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness,
      I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send
      famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it. '
    14: "¹⁴ Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would\
      \ deliver only themselves by their righteousness,” says the Lord God. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they empty it, and
      make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts, '
    16: "¹⁶ even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord God,\
      \ “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered,\
      \ and the land would be desolate. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land,’
      and I cut off man and beast from it, '
    18: "¹⁸ even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord God,\
      \ “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would\
      \ be delivered. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in
      blood, and cut off from it man and beast, '
    20: "²⁰ even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live,” says the Lord\
      \ God, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only\
      \ themselves by their righteousness.” \n"
    21: '²¹ For thus says the Lord God: “How much more it shall be when I send My
      four severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword and famine and wild beasts and
      pestilence—to cut off man and beast from it? '
    22: '²² Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out,
      both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see
      their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the disaster
      that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it. '
    23: ²³ And they will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; and
      you shall know that I have done nothing without cause that I have done in it,”
      says the Lord God.
  15:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    2: '² “Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any other wood, the
      vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? '
    3: '³ Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it
      to hang any vessel on? '
    4: '⁴ Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends
      of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work? '
    5: "⁵ Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less\
      \ will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the
      trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give
      up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; '
    7: '⁷ and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but
      another fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when
      I set My face against them. '
    8: ⁸ Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,’
      says the Lord God.”
  16:
    1: '¹ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem: “Your birth and your nativity
      are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. '
    4: '⁴ As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut,
      nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor
      wrapped in swaddling cloths. '
    5: "⁵ No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion\
      \ on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were\
      \ loathed on the day you were born. \n"
    6: '⁶ “And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said
      to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ '
    7: "⁷ I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and\
      \ became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were\
      \ naked and bare. \n"
    8: "⁸ “When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the\
      \ time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes,\
      \ I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became\
      \ Mine,” says the Lord God. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and
      I anointed you with oil. '
    10: '¹⁰ I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin;
      I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. '
    11: '¹¹ I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain
      on your neck. '
    12: '¹² And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful
      crown on your head. '
    13: '¹³ Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine
      linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate pastry of fine flour, honey, and
      oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty. '
    14: "¹⁴ Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was\
      \ perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your
      fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it. '
    16: '¹⁶ You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for
      yourself, and played the harlot on them. Such things should not happen, nor
      be. '
    17: '¹⁷ You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver,
      which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot
      with them. '
    18: '¹⁸ You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil
      and My incense before them. '
    19: "¹⁹ Also My food which I gave you—the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey\
      \ which I fed you—you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was,” says\
      \ the Lord God. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me,
      and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry
      a small matter, '
    21: '²¹ that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing
      them to pass through the fire? '
    22: "²² And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember\
      \ the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “Then it was so, after all your wickedness—‘Woe, woe to you!’ says the
      Lord God— '
    24: '²⁴ that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself
      in every street. '
    25: '²⁵ You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty
      to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied
      your acts of harlotry. '
    26: "²⁶ You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors,\
      \ and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your
      allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters
      of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. '
    28: '²⁸ You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable;
      indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied. '
    29: "²⁹ Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the\
      \ trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied. \n"
    30: "³⁰ “How degenerate is your heart!” says the Lord God, “seeing you do all\
      \ these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot. \n"
    31: '³¹ “You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high
      place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment. '
    32: '³² You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband. '
    33: '³³ Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your
      lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry. '
    34: "³⁴ You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited\
      \ you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you,\
      \ therefore you are the opposite.” \n"
    35: '³⁵ ‘Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord! '
    36: '³⁶ Thus says the Lord God: “Because your filthiness was poured out and your
      nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable
      idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them, '
    37: '³⁷ surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure,
      all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around
      against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your
      nakedness. '
    38: '³⁸ And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged;
      I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy. '
    39: "³⁹ I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines\
      \ and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes,\
      \ take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone
      you with stones and thrust you through with their swords. '
    41: '⁴¹ They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in
      the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you
      shall no longer hire lovers. '
    42: '⁴² So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart
      from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more. '
    43: "⁴³ Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with\
      \ all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds on your own head,”\
      \ says the Lord God. “And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your\
      \ abominations. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you:
      ‘Like mother, like daughter!’ '
    45: "⁴⁵ You are your mother’s daughter, loathing husband and children; and you\
      \ are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your\
      \ mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north
      of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and
      her daughters. '
    47: "⁴⁷ You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations;\
      \ but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all\
      \ your ways. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ “As I live,” says the Lord God, “neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters
      have done as you and your daughters have done. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter
      had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen
      the hand of the poor and needy. '
    50: "⁵⁰ And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I\
      \ took them away as I saw fit. \n"
    51: '⁵¹ “Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your
      abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations
      which you have done. '
    52: "⁵² You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because the sins\
      \ which you committed were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous\
      \ than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified\
      \ your sisters. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters,
      and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the
      captives of your captivity among them, '
    54: '⁵⁴ that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did
      when you comforted them. '
    55: '⁵⁵ When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state,
      and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your
      daughters will return to your former state. '
    56: '⁵⁶ For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your
      pride, '
    57: '⁵⁷ before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach
      of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of
      the Philistines, who despise you everywhere. '
    58: '⁵⁸ You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations,” says the Lord. '
    59: "⁵⁹ For thus says the Lord God: “I will deal with you as you have done, who\
      \ despised the oath by breaking the covenant. \n"
    60: '⁶⁰ “Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your
      youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. '
    61: '⁶¹ Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your
      older and your younger sisters; for I will give them to you for daughters, but
      not because of My covenant with you. '
    62: '⁶² And I will establish My covenant with you. Then you shall know that I
      am the Lord, '
    63: ⁶³ that you may remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth anymore
      because of your shame, when I provide you an atonement for all you have done,”
      says the Lord God.’ ”
  17:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, pose a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel, '
    3: "³ and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God:\n“A great eagle with large wings and long\
      \ pinions,\nFull of feathers of various colors,\nCame to Lebanon\nAnd took from\
      \ the cedar the highest branch.\n"
    4: "⁴ He cropped off its topmost young twig\nAnd carried it to a land of trade;\n\
      He set it in a city of merchants.\n"
    5: "⁵ Then he took some of the seed of the land\nAnd planted it in a fertile field;\n\
      He placed it by abundant waters\nAnd set it like a willow tree.\n"
    6: "⁶ And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature;\nIts branches turned\
      \ toward him,\nBut its roots were under it.\nSo it became a vine,\nBrought forth\
      \ branches,\nAnd put forth shoots. \n"
    7: "⁷ “But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers;\n\
      And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him,\nAnd stretched its branches\
      \ toward him,\nFrom the garden terrace where it had been planted,\nThat he might\
      \ water it.\n"
    8: "⁸ It was planted in good soil by many waters,\nTo bring forth branches, bear\
      \ fruit,\nAnd become a majestic vine.” ’ \n"
    9: "⁹ “Say, ‘Thus says the Lord God:\n“Will it thrive?\nWill he not pull up its\
      \ roots,\nCut off its fruit,\nAnd leave it to wither?\nAll of its spring leaves\
      \ will wither,\nAnd no great power or many people\nWill be needed to pluck it\
      \ up by its roots.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Behold, it is planted,\nWill it thrive?\nWill it not utterly wither when\
      \ the east wind touches it?\nIt will wither in the garden terrace where it grew.”\
      \ ’ ” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Say now to the rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’
      Tell them, ‘Indeed the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and
      princes, and led them with him to Babylon. '
    13: '¹³ And he took the king’s offspring, made a covenant with him, and put him
      under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, '
    14: '¹⁴ that the kingdom might be brought low and not lift itself up, but that
      by keeping his covenant it might stand. '
    15: "¹⁵ But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that\
      \ they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does\
      \ such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered? \n"
    16: '¹⁶ ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells
      who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—with him
      in the midst of Babylon he shall die. '
    17: '¹⁷ Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in
      the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons. '
    18: "¹⁸ Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave\
      \ his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.’ ” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore thus says the Lord God: “As I live, surely My oath which he
      despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head. '
    20: '²⁰ I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will
      bring him to Babylon and try him there for the treason which he committed against
      Me. '
    21: "²¹ All his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those\
      \ who remain shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the\
      \ Lord, have spoken.” \n"
    22: '²² Thus says the Lord God: “I will take also one of the highest branches
      of the high cedar and set it out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young
      twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and prominent mountain. '
    23: '²³ On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth
      boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. Under it will dwell birds of
      every sort; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell. '
    24: ²⁴ And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought
      down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made
      the dry tree flourish; I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it.”
  18:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, '

    9: "⁹ If he has walked in My statutes\nAnd kept My judgments faithfully—\nHe is\
      \ just;\nHe shall surely live!”\nSays the Lord God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “If he begets a son who is a robber\nOr a shedder of blood,\nWho does\

    14: "¹⁴ “If, however, he begets a son\nWho sees all the sins which his father\

    15: "¹⁵ Who has not eaten on the mountains,\nNor lifted his eyes to the idols\

    21: '²¹ “But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed, keeps
      all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he
      shall not die. '
    22: '²² None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered
      against him; because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live. '
    23: "²³ Do I have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?” says the Lord\
      \ God, “and not that he should turn from his ways and live? \n"
    24: "²⁴ “But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits\
      \ iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does,\
      \ shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered;\
      \ because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the sin which he has\
      \ committed, because of them he shall die. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ Hear now, O house of
      Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair? '
    26: '²⁶ When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity,
      and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done that he dies. '
    27: '²⁷ Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed,
      and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive. '
    28: '²⁸ Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which
      he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die. '
    29: "²⁹ Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house\
      \ of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair?\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to
      his ways,” says the Lord God. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions,
      so that iniquity will not be your ruin. '
    31: '³¹ Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and
      get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house
      of Israel? '
    32: ³² For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies,” says the Lord God.
      “Therefore turn and live!”
  19:
    1: '¹ “Moreover take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, '
    2: "² and say:\n‘What is your mother? A lioness:\nShe lay down among the lions;\n\
      Among the young lions she nourished her cubs.\n"
    3: "³ She brought up one of her cubs,\nAnd he became a young lion;\nHe learned\
      \ to catch prey,\nAnd he devoured men.\n"
    4: "⁴ The nations also heard of him;\nHe was trapped in their pit,\nAnd they brought\
      \ him with chains to the land of Egypt. \n"
    5: "⁵ ‘When she saw that she waited, that her hope was lost,\nShe took another\
      \ of her cubs and made him a young lion.\n"
    6: "⁶ He roved among the lions,\nAnd became a young lion;\nHe learned to catch\
      \ prey;\nHe devoured men.\n"
    7: "⁷ He knew their desolate places,\nAnd laid waste their cities;\nThe land with\
      \ its fullness was desolated\nBy the noise of his roaring.\n"
    8: "⁸ Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side,\nAnd\
      \ spread their net over him;\nHe was trapped in their pit.\n"
    9: "⁹ They put him in a cage with chains,\nAnd brought him to the king of Babylon;\n\
      They brought him in nets,\nThat his voice should no longer be heard on the mountains\

    10: "¹⁰ ‘Your mother was like a vine in your bloodline,\nPlanted by the waters,\n\
      Fruitful and full of branches\nBecause of many waters.\n"
    11: "¹¹ She had strong branches for scepters of rulers.\nShe towered in stature\
      \ above the thick branches,\nAnd was seen in her height amid the dense foliage.\n"
    12: "¹² But she was plucked up in fury,\nShe was cast down to the ground,\nAnd\
      \ the east wind dried her fruit.\nHer strong branches were broken and withered;\n\
      The fire consumed them.\n"
    13: "¹³ And now she is planted in the wilderness,\nIn a dry and thirsty land.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Fire has come out from a rod of her branches\nAnd devoured her fruit,\n\
      So that she has no strong branch—a scepter for ruling.’ ”\nThis is a lamentation,\

  20:
    1: '¹ It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day
      of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord,
      and sat before me. '
    2: '² Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    3: '³ “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says
      the Lord God: “Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live,” says the Lord God,
      “I will not be inquired of by you.” ’ '
    4: "⁴ Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then make known to\
      \ them the abominations of their fathers. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day when I chose Israel and
      raised My hand in an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made
      Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand in an oath to them,
      saying, ‘I am the Lord your God.’ '
    6: '⁶ On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, to bring them out of the
      land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, ‘flowing with milk
      and honey,’ the glory of all lands. '
    7: '⁷ Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, throw away the abominations which are
      before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am
      the Lord your God.’ '
    8: '⁸ But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not all cast
      away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the
      idols of Egypt. Then I said, ‘I will pour out My fury on them and fulfill My
      anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.’ '
    9: "⁹ But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the\
      \ Gentiles among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them,\
      \ to bring them out of the land of Egypt. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into
      the wilderness. '
    11: '¹¹ And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, ‘which, if a
      man does, he shall live by them.’ '
    12: '¹² Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me,
      that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them. '
    13: '¹³ Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did
      not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, ‘which, if a man does,
      he shall live by them’; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said I
      would pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before
      the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I also raised My hand in an oath to them in the wilderness, that I
      would not bring them into the land which I had given them, ‘flowing with milk
      and honey,’ the glory of all lands, '
    16: '¹⁶ because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but
      profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. '
    17: "¹⁷ Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end\
      \ of them in the wilderness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “But I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes
      of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their
      idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I am the Lord your God: Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do
      them; '
    20: "²⁰ hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you\
      \ may know that I am the Lord your God.’ \n"
    21: '²¹ “Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk
      in My statutes, and were not careful to observe My judgments, ‘which, if a man
      does, he shall live by them’; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would
      pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness. '
    22: '²² Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My name’s sake, that it
      should not be profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought
      them out. '
    23: '²³ Also I raised My hand in an oath to those in the wilderness, that I would
      scatter them among the Gentiles and disperse them throughout the countries, '
    24: "²⁴ because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes,\
      \ profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments
      by which they could not live; '
    26: "²⁶ and I pronounced them unclean because of their ritual gifts, in that they\
      \ caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire, that I might make them\
      \ desolate and that they might know that I am the Lord.” ’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them,
      ‘Thus says the Lord God: “In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being
      unfaithful to Me. '
    28: '²⁸ When I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand
      in an oath to give them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees,
      there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There
      they also sent up their sweet aroma and poured out their drink offerings. '
    29: '²⁹ Then I said to them, ‘What is this high place to which you go?’ So its
      name is called Bamah to this day.” ’ '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Are you
      defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing harlotry according
      to their abominations? '
    31: '³¹ For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire,
      you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired
      of by you, O house of Israel? As I live,” says the Lord God, “I will not be
      inquired of by you. '
    32: "³² What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, ‘We will be like\
      \ the Gentiles, like the families in other countries, serving wood and stone.’\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ “As I live,” says the Lord God, “surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched
      arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you. '
    34: '³⁴ I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries
      where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with
      fury poured out. '
    35: '³⁵ And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will
      plead My case with you face to face. '
    36: "³⁶ Just as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land\
      \ of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you,” says the Lord God. \n"
    37: '³⁷ “I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond
      of the covenant; '
    38: "³⁸ I will purge the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against\
      \ Me; I will bring them out of the country where they dwell, but they shall\
      \ not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “As for you, O house of Israel,” thus says the Lord God: “Go, serve every
      one of you his idols—and hereafter—if you will not obey Me; but profane My holy
      name no more with your gifts and your idols. '
    40: '⁴⁰ For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel,” says the Lord
      God, “there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me;
      there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits
      of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things. '
    41: '⁴¹ I will accept you as a sweet aroma when I bring you out from the peoples
      and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will
      be hallowed in you before the Gentiles. '
    42: '⁴² Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land
      of Israel, into the country for which I raised My hand in an oath to give to
      your fathers. '
    43: '⁴³ And there you shall remember your ways and all your doings with which
      you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because
      of all the evils that you have committed. '
    44: "⁴⁴ Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have dealt with you for\
      \ My name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt\
      \ doings, O house of Israel,” says the Lord God.’ ” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Furthermore the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    46: '⁴⁶ “Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south
      and prophesy against the forest land, the South, '
    47: '⁴⁷ and say to the forest of the South, ‘Hear the word of the Lord! Thus says
      the Lord God: “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every
      green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched,
      and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it. '
    48: "⁴⁸ All flesh shall see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it shall not be\
      \ quenched.” ’ ” \n"
    49: ⁴⁹ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! They say of me, ‘Does he not speak parables?’
      ”
  21:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, preach against the holy places,
      and prophesy against the land of Israel; '
    3: '³ and say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Behold, I am against
      you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off both righteous and
      wicked from you. '
    4: '⁴ Because I will cut off both righteous and wicked from you, therefore My
      sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north, '
    5: '⁵ that all flesh may know that I, the Lord, have drawn My sword out of its
      sheath; it shall not return anymore.” ’ '
    6: '⁶ Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and sigh with bitterness
      before their eyes. '
    7: "⁷ And it shall be when they say to you, ‘Why are you sighing?’ that you shall\
      \ answer, ‘Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands\
      \ will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water.\
      \ Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass,’ says the Lord God.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    9: "⁹ “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord!’ Say:\n‘A sword, a sword\
      \ is sharpened\nAnd also polished!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharpened to make a dreadful slaughter,\nPolished to flash like lightning!\n\
      Should we then make mirth?\nIt despises the scepter of My son,\nAs it does all\
      \ wood.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And He has given it to be polished,\nThat it may be handled;\nThis sword\
      \ is sharpened, and it is polished\nTo be given into the hand of the slayer.’\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² “Cry and wail, son of man;\nFor it will be against My people,\nAgainst\
      \ all the princes of Israel.\nTerrors including the sword will be against My\
      \ people;\nTherefore strike your thigh. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Because it is a testing,\nAnd what if the sword despises even the scepter?\n\
      The scepter shall be no more,”\nsays the Lord God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “You therefore, son of man, prophesy,\nAnd strike your hands together.\n\
      The third time let the sword do double damage.\nIt is the sword that slays,\n\
      The sword that slays the great men,\nThat enters their private chambers.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,\nThat the heart\
      \ may melt and many may stumble.\nAh! It is made bright;\nIt is grasped for\
      \ slaughter: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Swords at the ready!\nThrust right!\nSet your blade!\nThrust left—\n\
      Wherever your edge is ordered! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “I also will beat My fists together,\nAnd I will cause My fury to rest;\n\
      I, the Lord, have spoken.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The word of the Lord came to me again, saying: '
    19: '¹⁹ “And son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king
      of Babylon to go; both of them shall go from the same land. Make a sign; put
      it at the head of the road to the city. '
    20: '²⁰ Appoint a road for the sword to go to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to
      Judah, into fortified Jerusalem. '
    21: '²¹ For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork
      of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images,
      he looks at the liver. '
    22: '²² In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering
      rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering
      rams against the gates, to heap up a siege mound, and to build a wall. '
    23: "²³ And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who\
      \ have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance,\
      \ that they may be taken. \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have made your iniquity\
      \ to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all\
      \ your doings your sins appear—because you have come to remembrance, you shall\
      \ be taken in hand. \n"
    25: '²⁵ ‘Now to you, O profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose
      iniquity shall end, '
    26: "²⁶ thus says the Lord God:\n“Remove the turban, and take off the crown;\n\
      Nothing shall remain the same.\nExalt the humble, and humble the exalted.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Overthrown, overthrown,\nI will make it overthrown!\nIt shall be no longer,\n\
      Until He comes whose right it is,\nAnd I will give it to Him.” ’ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God concerning\
      \ the Ammonites and concerning their reproach,’ and say:\n‘A sword, a sword\
      \ is drawn,\nPolished for slaughter,\nFor consuming, for flashing—\n"
    29: "²⁹ While they see false visions for you,\nWhile they divine a lie to you,\n\
      To bring you on the necks of the wicked, the slain\nWhose day has come,\nWhose\

    30: "³⁰ ‘Return it to its sheath.\nI will judge you\nIn the place where you were\

    31: "³¹ I will pour out My indignation on you;\nI will blow against you with the\
      \ fire of My wrath,\nAnd deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skillful\
      \ to destroy.\n"
    32: "³² You shall be fuel for the fire;\nYour blood shall be in the midst of the\
      \ land.\nYou shall not be remembered,\nFor I the Lord have spoken.’ ”"
  22:
    1: '¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Now, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show
      her all her abominations! '
    3: '³ Then say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “The city sheds blood in her own midst,
      that her time may come; and she makes idols within herself to defile herself. '
    4: '⁴ You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled
      yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw
      near, and have come to the end of your years; therefore I have made you a reproach
      to the nations, and a mockery to all countries. '
    5: "⁵ Those near and those far from you will mock you as infamous and full of\
      \ tumult. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Look, the princes of Israel: each one has used his power to shed blood
      in you. '
    7: '⁷ In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have
      oppressed the stranger; in you they have mistreated the fatherless and the widow. '
    8: '⁸ You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths. '
    9: '⁹ In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you are those who eat
      on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness. '
    10: '¹⁰ In you men uncover their fathers’ nakedness; in you they violate women
      who are set apart during their impurity. '
    11: '¹¹ One commits abomination with his neighbor’s wife; another lewdly defiles
      his daughter-in-law; and another in you violates his sister, his father’s daughter. '
    12: "¹² In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you\
      \ have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me,”\
      \ says the Lord God. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Behold, therefore, I beat My fists at the dishonest profit which you
      have made, and at the bloodshed which has been in your midst. '
    14: '¹⁴ Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when
      I shall deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and will do it. '
    15: '¹⁵ I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the countries,
      and remove your filthiness completely from you. '
    16: "¹⁶ You shall defile yourself in the sight of the nations; then you shall\
      \ know that I am the Lord.” ’ ” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all
      bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of a furnace; they have become dross
      from silver. '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have all become dross,
      therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. '
    20: '²⁰ As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of a
      furnace, to blow fire on it, to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and
      in My fury, and I will leave you there and melt you. '
    21: '²¹ Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and
      you shall be melted in its midst. '
    22: "²² As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you be melted\
      \ in its midst; then you shall know that I, the Lord, have poured out My fury\
      \ on you.’ ” \n"
    23: '²³ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Son of man, say to her: ‘You are a land that is not cleansed or rained
      on in the day of indignation.’ '
    25: '²⁵ The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing
      the prey; they have devoured people; they have taken treasure and precious things;
      they have made many widows in her midst. '
    26: '²⁶ Her priests have violated My law and profaned My holy things; they have
      not distinguished between the holy and unholy, nor have they made known the
      difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes
      from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. '
    27: '²⁷ Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood,
      to destroy people, and to get dishonest gain. '
    28: '²⁸ Her prophets plastered them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions,
      and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ when the Lord
      had not spoken. '
    29: '²⁹ The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated
      the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the stranger. '
    30: '³⁰ So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the
      gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found
      no one. '
    31: ³¹ Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them
      with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds on their own heads,”
      says the Lord God.
  23:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord came again to me, saying: \n"
    2: "² “Son of man, there were two women,\nThe daughters of one mother.\n"
    3: "³ They committed harlotry in Egypt,\nThey committed harlotry in their youth;\n\
      Their breasts were there embraced,\nTheir virgin bosom was there pressed.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister;\nThey were Mine,\n\
      And they bore sons and daughters.\nAs for their names,\nSamaria is Oholah, and\
      \ Jerusalem is Oholibah. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Oholah played the harlot even though she was Mine;\nAnd she lusted for\
      \ her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,\n"
    6: "⁶ Who were clothed in purple,\nCaptains and rulers,\nAll of them desirable\
      \ young men,\nHorsemen riding on horses.\n"
    7: "⁷ Thus she committed her harlotry with them,\nAll of them choice men of Assyria;\n\
      And with all for whom she lusted,\nWith all their idols, she defiled herself.\n"
    8: "⁸ She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt,\nFor in her youth\
      \ they had lain with her,\nPressed her virgin bosom,\nAnd poured out their immorality\
      \ upon her. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I have delivered her\nInto the hand of her lovers,\nInto the\
      \ hand of the Assyrians,\nFor whom she lusted.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They uncovered her nakedness,\nTook away her sons and daughters,\nAnd\
      \ slew her with the sword;\nShe became a byword among women,\nFor they had executed\
      \ judgment on her. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in\
      \ her lust than she, and in her harlotry more corrupt than her sister’s harlotry.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² “She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians,\nCaptains and rulers,\nClothed\
      \ most gorgeously,\nHorsemen riding on horses,\nAll of them desirable young\
      \ men.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then I saw that she was defiled;\nBoth took the same way.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But she increased her harlotry;\nShe looked at men portrayed on the wall,\n\
      Images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Girded with belts around their waists,\nFlowing turbans on their heads,\n\
      All of them looking like captains,\nIn the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea,\n\
      The land of their nativity.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ As soon as her eyes saw them,\nShe lusted for them\nAnd sent messengers\
      \ to them in Chaldea. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Then the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love,\nAnd they defiled\
      \ her with their immorality;\nSo she was defiled by them, and alienated herself\
      \ from them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ She revealed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness.\nThen I alienated\
      \ Myself from her,\nAs I had alienated Myself from her sister. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Yet she multiplied her harlotry\nIn calling to remembrance the days of\
      \ her youth,\nWhen she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.\n"
    20: "²⁰ For she lusted for her paramours,\nWhose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys,\n\
      And whose issue is like the issue of horses.\n"
    21: "²¹ Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth,\nWhen the Egyptians\
      \ pressed your bosom\nBecause of your youthful breasts. \n"
    22: "²² “Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God:\n‘Behold, I will stir up\
      \ your lovers against you,\nFrom whom you have alienated yourself,\nAnd I will\
      \ bring them against you from every side:\n"
    23: "²³ The Babylonians,\nAll the Chaldeans,\nPekod, Shoa, Koa,\nAll the Assyrians\
      \ with them,\nAll of them desirable young men,\nGovernors and rulers,\nCaptains\
      \ and men of renown,\nAll of them riding on horses.\n"
    24: "²⁴ And they shall come against you\nWith chariots, wagons, and war-horses,\n\
      With a horde of people.\nThey shall array against you\nBuckler, shield, and\
      \ helmet all around. \n‘I will delegate judgment to them,\nAnd they shall judge\
      \ you according to their judgments.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will set My jealousy against you,\nAnd they shall deal furiously with\
      \ you;\nThey shall remove your nose and your ears,\nAnd your remnant shall fall\
      \ by the sword;\nThey shall take your sons and your daughters,\nAnd your remnant\
      \ shall be devoured by fire.\n"
    26: "²⁶ They shall also strip you of your clothes\nAnd take away your beautiful\
      \ jewelry. \n"
    27: "²⁷ ‘Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry\nBrought from\
      \ the land of Egypt,\nSo that you will not lift your eyes to them,\nNor remember\
      \ Egypt anymore.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “For thus says the Lord God: ‘Surely I will deliver you into the hand
      of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom you alienated yourself. '
    29: '²⁹ They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for,
      and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered,
      both your lewdness and your harlotry. '
    30: '³⁰ I will do these things to you because you have gone as a harlot after
      the Gentiles, because you have become defiled by their idols. '
    31: "³¹ You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup\
      \ in your hand.’ \n"
    32: "³² “Thus says the Lord God:\n‘You shall drink of your sister’s cup,\nThe\
      \ deep and wide one;\nYou shall be laughed to scorn\nAnd held in derision;\n\
      It contains much.\n"
    33: "³³ You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,\nThe cup of horror and\
      \ desolation,\nThe cup of your sister Samaria.\n"
    34: "³⁴ You shall drink and drain it,\nYou shall break its shards,\nAnd tear at\
      \ your own breasts;\nFor I have spoken,’\nSays the Lord God. \n"
    35: "³⁵ “Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n‘Because you have forgotten Me and\
      \ cast Me behind your back,\nTherefore you shall bear the penalty\nOf your lewdness\
      \ and your harlotry.’ ” \n"
    36: '³⁶ The Lord also said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?
      Then declare to them their abominations. '
    37: '³⁷ For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have
      committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they
      bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them. '
    38: '³⁸ Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on
      the same day and profaned My Sabbaths. '
    39: "³⁹ For after they had slain their children for their idols, on the same day\
      \ they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and indeed thus they have done\
      \ in the midst of My house. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was
      sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes,
      and adorned yourself with ornaments. '
    41: '⁴¹ You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which
      you had set My incense and My oil. '
    42: '⁴² The sound of a carefree multitude was with her, and Sabeans were brought
      from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their
      wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads. '
    43: '⁴³ Then I said concerning her who had grown old in adulteries, ‘Will they
      commit harlotry with her now, and she with them?’ '
    44: '⁴⁴ Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman who plays the harlot;
      thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women. '
    45: "⁴⁵ But righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and\
      \ after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and\
      \ blood is on their hands. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “For thus says the Lord God: ‘Bring up an assembly against them, give
      them up to trouble and plunder. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The assembly shall stone them with stones and execute them with their
      swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses
      with fire. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Thus I will cause lewdness to cease from the land, that all women may
      be taught not to practice your lewdness. '
    49: ⁴⁹ They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous
      sins. Then you shall know that I am the Lord God.’ ”
  24:
    1: '¹ Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month,
      the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day—the king of Babylon
      started his siege against Jerusalem this very day. '
    3: "³ And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, ‘Thus says\
      \ the Lord God:\n“Put on a pot, set it on,\nAnd also pour water into it.\n"
    4: "⁴ Gather pieces of meat in it,\nEvery good piece,\nThe thigh and the shoulder.\n\
      Fill it with choice cuts;\n"
    5: "⁵ Take the choice of the flock.\nAlso pile fuel bones under it,\nMake it boil\
      \ well,\nAnd let the cuts simmer in it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“Woe to the bloody city,\nTo the pot\
      \ whose scum is in it,\nAnd whose scum is not gone from it!\nBring it out piece\
      \ by piece,\nOn which no lot has fallen.\n"
    7: "⁷ For her blood is in her midst;\nShe set it on top of a rock;\nShe did not\
      \ pour it on the ground,\nTo cover it with dust.\n"
    8: "⁸ That it may raise up fury and take vengeance,\nI have set her blood on top\
      \ of a rock,\nThat it may not be covered.” \n"
    9: "⁹ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“Woe to the bloody city!\nI too will\
      \ make the pyre great.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Heap on the wood,\nKindle the fire;\nCook the meat well,\nMix in the spices,\n\
      And let the cuts be burned up. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Then set the pot empty on the coals,\nThat it may become hot and its\
      \ bronze may burn,\nThat its filthiness may be melted in it,\nThat its scum\
      \ may be consumed.\n"
    12: "¹² She has grown weary with lies,\nAnd her great scum has not gone from her.\n\
      Let her scum be in the fire!\n"
    13: "¹³ In your filthiness is lewdness.\nBecause I have cleansed you, and you\
      \ were not cleansed,\nYou will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore,\n\
      Till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I, the Lord, have spoken it;\nIt shall come to pass, and I will do it;\n\
      I will not hold back,\nNor will I spare,\nNor will I relent;\nAccording to your\

      \ ” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Also the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with
      one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down. '
    17: "¹⁷ Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your\
      \ head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips, and do not\
      \ eat man’s bread of sorrow.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died;\
      \ and the next morning I did as I was commanded. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things signify\

    20: '²⁰ Then I answered them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '

    22: '²² And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips nor eat
      man’s bread of sorrow. '
    23: '²³ Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you
      shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and
      mourn with one another. '
    24: "²⁴ Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall\
      \ do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord God.’ ” \n"
    25: '²⁵ ‘And you, son of man—will it not be in the day when I take from them their

  25:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them. '
    3: '³ Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord

    4: '⁴ indeed, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the men of the

    8: '⁸ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Look! The house of

    10: '¹⁰ To the men of the East I will give it as a possession, together with the
      Ammonites, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. '
    11: "¹¹ And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am\

  26:
    1: '¹ And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month,

    11: '¹¹ With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will
      slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. '
    12: '¹² They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will
      break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will lay your stones,

    25: "²⁵ They have set her bed in the midst of the slain,\nWith all her multitude,\n\
      With her graves all around it,\nAll of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword;\n\
      Though their terror was caused\nIn the land of the living,\nYet they bear their\
      \ shame\nWith those who go down to the Pit;\nIt was put in the midst of the\

    26: "²⁶ “There are Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes,\nWith all their\

    27: "²⁷ They do not lie with the mighty\nWho are fallen of the uncircumcised,\n\

  33:
    1: '¹ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: ‘When
      I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their
      territory and make him their watchman, '
    3: '³ when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and
      warns the people, '
    4: '⁴ then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if
      the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his own head. '
    5: '⁵ He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall
      be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his life. '
    6: "⁶ But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet,\
      \ and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from\
      \ among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require\
      \ at the watchman’s hand.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel;
      therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me. '
    8: '⁸ When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you shall surely die!’ and you
      do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his
      iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. '
    9: "⁹ Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not\
      \ turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your\
      \ soul. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘Thus you say,
      “If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how
      can we then live?” ’ '
    11: "¹¹ Say to them: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the\
      \ death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn,\
      \ turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’ \n"
    12: '¹² “Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The
      righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression;
      as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the
      day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live
      because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.’ '
    13: '¹³ When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, but he trusts in
      his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall
      be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die. '
    14: '¹⁴ Again, when I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ if he turns from
      his sin and does what is lawful and right, '
    15: '¹⁵ if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and
      walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live;
      he shall not die. '
    16: "¹⁶ None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him;\
      \ he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Yet the children of your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’
      But it is their way which is not fair! '
    18: '¹⁸ When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity,
      he shall die because of it. '
    19: '¹⁹ But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful
      and right, he shall live because of it. '
    20: "²⁰ Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, I will\
      \ judge every one of you according to his own ways.” \n"
    21: "²¹ And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth\
      \ month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem\
      \ came to me and said, “The city has been captured!” \n"
    22: "²² Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the man came\
      \ who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the\
      \ morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    24: "²⁴ “Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying,\
      \ ‘Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we are many; the land\
      \ has been given to us as a possession.’ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “You eat meat with blood,
      you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess
      the land? '
    26: "²⁶ You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another’s\
      \ wives. Should you then possess the land?” ’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Say thus to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “As I live, surely those who
      are in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field
      I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds
      and caves shall die of the pestilence. '
    28: '²⁸ For I will make the land most desolate, her arrogant strength shall cease,
      and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through. '
    29: "²⁹ Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land most\
      \ desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.” ’ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about
      you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another,
      everyone saying to his brother, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that
      comes from the Lord.’ '
    31: '³¹ So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and
      they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show
      much love, but their hearts pursue their own gain. '
    32: '³² Indeed you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant
      voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they
      do not do them. '
    33: ³³ And when this comes to pass—surely it will come—then they will know that
      a prophet has been among them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say
      to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the shepherds: “Woe to the shepherds of
      Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? '
    3: '³ You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings,
      but you do not feed the flock. '
    4: '⁴ The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick,
      nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what
      was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them. '
    5: '⁵ So they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food
      for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. '
    6: "⁶ My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes,\
      \ My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking\
      \ or searching for them.” \n"
    7: '⁷ ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    8: '⁸ “As I live,” says the Lord God, “surely because My flock became a prey,
      and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because there was no
      shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves
      and did not feed My flock”— '
    9: '⁹ therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the Lord! '
    10: "¹⁰ Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will\
      \ require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep,\
      \ and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock\
      \ from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘For thus says the Lord God: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep
      and seek them out. '
    12: '¹² As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered
      sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where
      they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day. '
    13: '¹³ And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries,
      and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of
      Israel, in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high
      mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich
      pasture on the mountains of Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down,” says the Lord God. '
    16: "¹⁶ “I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up\
      \ the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the\
      \ strong, and feed them in judgment.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I shall
      judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats. '
    18: '¹⁸ Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must
      tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture—and to have drunk of the
      clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet? '
    19: "¹⁹ And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and\
      \ they drink what you have fouled with your feet.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God to them: “Behold, I Myself will judge
      between the fat and the lean sheep. '
    21: '²¹ Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones
      with your horns, and scattered them abroad, '
    22: '²² therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and
      I will judge between sheep and sheep. '
    23: '²³ I will establish one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them—My servant
      David. He shall feed them and be their shepherd. '
    24: "²⁴ And I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David a prince among\
      \ them; I, the Lord, have spoken. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I will make a covenant of peace with them, and cause wild beasts to cease
      from the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the
      woods. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will
      cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing. '
    27: '²⁷ Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall
      yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that
      I am the Lord, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them
      from the hand of those who enslaved them. '
    28: '²⁸ And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of
      the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them
      afraid. '
    29: '²⁹ I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they shall no longer
      be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the Gentiles anymore. '
    30: "³⁰ Thus they shall know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and they,\
      \ the house of Israel, are My people,” says the Lord God.’ \n"
    31: ³¹ “You are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your
      God,” says the Lord God.
  35:
    1: '¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it, '
    3: "³ and say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord God:\n“Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against\
      \ you;\nI will stretch out My hand against you,\nAnd make you most desolate;\n"
    4: "⁴ I shall lay your cities waste,\nAnd you shall be desolate.\nThen you shall\
      \ know that I am the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the
      children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity,
      when their iniquity came to an end, '
    6: '⁶ therefore, as I live,” says the Lord God, “I will prepare you for blood,
      and blood shall pursue you; since you have not hated blood, therefore blood
      shall pursue you. '
    7: '⁷ Thus I will make Mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it the one who
      leaves and the one who returns. '
    8: '⁸ And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your
      valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall. '
    9: "⁹ I will make you perpetually desolate, and your cities shall be uninhabited;\
      \ then you shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two countries shall
      be mine, and we will possess them,’ although the Lord was there, '
    11: '¹¹ therefore, as I live,” says the Lord God, “I will do according to your
      anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them;
      and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you. '
    12: '¹² Then you shall know that I am the Lord. I have heard all your blasphemies
      which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are desolate;
      they are given to us to consume.’ '
    13: "¹³ Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words\
      \ against Me; I have heard them.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “The whole earth will rejoice when I make you
      desolate. '
    15: ¹⁵ As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate,
      so I will do to you; you shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of
      Edom—all of it! Then they shall know that I am the Lord.” ’
  36:
    1: '¹ “And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, ‘O mountains
      of Israel, hear the word of the Lord! '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord God: “Because the enemy has said of you, ‘Aha! The ancient
      heights have become our possession,’ ” ’ '
    3: '³ therefore prophesy, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Because they made
      you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession

      slandered by the people”— '
    4: '⁴ therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says
      the Lord God to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate
      wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery
      to the rest of the nations all around— '
    5: "⁵ therefore thus says the Lord God: “Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy\
      \ against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave My land to\

      \ to plunder its open country.” ’ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains,

      have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of
      the nations.” '
    7: '⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord God: “I have raised My hand in an oath that
      surely the nations that are around you shall bear their own shame. '
    8: '⁸ But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and
      yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come. '
    9: '⁹ For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled
      and sown. '
    10: '¹⁰ I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and
      the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. '
    11: '¹¹ I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear
      young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than
      at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    12: "¹² Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take\
      \ possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave\
      \ them of children.” \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Because they say to you, ‘You devour men and
      bereave your nation of children,’ '
    14: '¹⁴ therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore,”
      says the Lord God. '
    15: "¹⁵ “Nor will I let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore, nor bear the\
      \ reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble\
      \ anymore,” says the Lord God.’ ” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled
      it by their own ways and deeds; to Me their way was like the uncleanness of
      a woman in her customary impurity. '
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore I poured out My fury on them for the blood they had shed on
      the land, and for their idols with which they had defiled it. '
    19: '¹⁹ So I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout
      the countries; I judged them according to their ways and their deeds. '
    20: '²⁰ When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy
      name—when they said of them, ‘These are the people of the Lord, and yet they
      have gone out of His land.’ '
    21: "²¹ But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned\
      \ among the nations wherever they went. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I do
      not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name’s sake, which
      you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. '
    23: '²³ And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations,
      which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am
      the Lord,” says the Lord God, “when I am hallowed in you before their eyes. '
    24: '²⁴ For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries,
      and bring you into your own land. '
    25: '²⁵ Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will
      cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. '
    26: '²⁶ I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take
      the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. '
    27: '²⁷ I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes,
      and you will keep My judgments and do them. '
    28: '²⁸ Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall
      be My people, and I will be your God. '
    29: '²⁹ I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain
      and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. '
    30: '³⁰ And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields,
      so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. '
    31: '³¹ Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good;
      and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your
      abominations. '
    32: "³² Not for your sake do I do this,” says the Lord God, “let it be known to\
      \ you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!” \n"
    33: '³³ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your
      iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall
      be rebuilt. '
    34: '³⁴ The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight
      of all who pass by. '
    35: '³⁵ So they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden
      of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’ '
    36: "³⁶ Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the\

    37: '³⁷ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will also let the house of Israel inquire
      of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock. '
    38: ³⁸ Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on
      its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then
      they shall know that I am the Lord.” ’ ”
  37:
    1: '¹ The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the
      Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. '
    2: '² Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very
      many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry. '
    3: "³ And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”\nSo I answered, “O\
      \ Lord God, You know.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones,

    5: '⁵ Thus says the Lord God to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter
      into you, and you shall live. '
    6: "⁶ I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and\
      \ put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.”\

    7: '⁷ So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise,

    8: "⁸ Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin\
      \ covered them over; but there was no breath in them. \n"
    9: '⁹ Also He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say
      to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Come from the four winds, O breath,
      and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ” '
    10: "¹⁰ So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they\
      \ lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
      They indeed say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are
      cut off!’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Behold,
      O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves,
      and bring you into the land of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves,
      O My people, and brought you up from your graves. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you\
      \ in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it and\
      \ performed it,” says the Lord.’ ” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for you, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: ‘For
      Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions.’ Then take another stick
      and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of
      Israel, his companions.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will\
      \ become one in your hand. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you
      not show us what you mean by these?’— '
    19: '¹⁹ say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will take the stick of
      Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions;
      and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick,
      and they will be one in My hand.” ’ '
    20: "²⁰ And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ “Then say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will take the children
      of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them
      from every side and bring them into their own land; '
    22: '²² and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel;
      and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations,
      nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again. '
    23: "²³ They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their\
      \ detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver\
      \ them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse\
      \ them. Then they shall be My people, and I will be their God. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “David My servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one
      shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and observe My statutes, and
      do them. '
    25: '²⁵ Then they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant,
      where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children,
      and their children’s children, forever; and My servant David shall be their
      prince forever. '
    26: '²⁶ Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an
      everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and
      I will set My sanctuary in their midst forevermore. '
    27: '²⁷ My tabernacle also shall be with them; indeed I will be their God, and
      they shall be My people. '
    28: ²⁸ The nations also will know that I, the Lord, sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary
      is in their midst forevermore.” ’ ”
  38:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince
      of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the
      prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. '
    4: '⁴ I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with
      all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company
      with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords. '
    5: '⁵ Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; '
    6: "⁶ Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all\
      \ its troops—many people are with you. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Prepare yourself and be ready, you and all your companies that are gathered
      about you; and be a guard for them. '
    8: '⁸ After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come into
      the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many people
      on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought
      out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely. '
    9: "⁹ You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you\
      \ and all your troops and many peoples with you.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts
      will arise in your mind, and you will make an evil plan: '
    11: '¹¹ You will say, ‘I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will
      go to a peaceful people, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls,
      and having neither bars nor gates’— '
    12: '¹² to take plunder and to take booty, to stretch out your hand against the
      waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered from the
      nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell in the midst of the
      land. '
    13: "¹³ Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will\
      \ say to you, ‘Have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to\
      \ take booty, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods,\
      \ to take great plunder?’ ” ’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord God:
      “On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it? '
    15: '¹⁵ Then you will come from your place out of the far north, you and many
      peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty
      army. '
    16: '¹⁶ You will come up against My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land.
      It will be in the latter days that I will bring you against My land, so that
      the nations may know Me, when I am hallowed in you, O Gog, before their eyes.” '
    17: "¹⁷ Thus says the Lord God: “Are you he of whom I have spoken in former days\
      \ by My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days\
      \ that I would bring you against them? \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “And it will come to pass at the same time, when Gog comes against the
      land of Israel,” says the Lord God, “that My fury will show in My face. '
    19: '¹⁹ For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken: ‘Surely
      in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel, '
    20: '²⁰ so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the
      field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the
      face of the earth shall shake at My presence. The mountains shall be thrown
      down, the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.’ '
    21: '²¹ I will call for a sword against Gog throughout all My mountains,” says
      the Lord God. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother. '
    22: '²² And I will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed; I will
      rain down on him, on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, flooding
      rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. '
    23: ²³ Thus I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will be known in
      the eyes of many nations. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.” ’
  39:
    1: '¹ “And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord
      God: “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal; '
    2: '² and I will turn you around and lead you on, bringing you up from the far
      north, and bring you against the mountains of Israel. '
    3: '³ Then I will knock the bow out of your left hand, and cause the arrows to
      fall out of your right hand. '
    4: '⁴ You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and
      the peoples who are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every sort
      and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. '
    5: '⁵ You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken,” says the Lord God. '
    6: '⁶ “And I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the
      coastlands. Then they shall know that I am the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ So I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and
      I will not let them profane My holy name anymore. Then the nations shall know
      that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel. '
    8: "⁸ Surely it is coming, and it shall be done,” says the Lord God. “This is\
      \ the day of which I have spoken. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and set on fire
      and burn the weapons, both the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the
      javelins and spears; and they will make fires with them for seven years. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will not take wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests,\
      \ because they will make fires with the weapons; and they will plunder those\
      \ who plundered them, and pillage those who pillaged them,” says the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place
      there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will
      obstruct travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude.
      Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog. '
    12: '¹² For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to
      cleanse the land. '
    13: '¹³ Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain
      renown for it on the day that I am glorified,” says the Lord God. '
    14: '¹⁴ “They will set apart men regularly employed, with the help of a search
      party, to pass through the land and bury those bodies remaining on the ground,
      in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search. '
    15: '¹⁵ The search party will pass through the land; and when anyone sees a man’s
      bone, he shall set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the
      Valley of Hamon Gog. '
    16: "¹⁶ The name of the city will also be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the\
      \ land.” ’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord God, ‘Speak to every sort\

    18: "¹⁸ You shall eat the flesh of the mighty,\nDrink the blood of the princes\

    21: '²¹ “I will set My glory among the nations; all the nations shall see My judgment
      which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them. '
    22: '²² So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that
      day forward. '
    23: '²³ The Gentiles shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for
      their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face
      from them. I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by
      the sword. '
    24: "²⁴ According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I\

    25: '²⁵ “Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Now I will bring back the captives
      of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous
      for My holy name— '
    26: '²⁶ after they have borne their shame, and all their unfaithfulness in which
      they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no
      one made them afraid. '
    27: '²⁷ When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of
      their enemies’ lands, and I am hallowed in them in the sight of many nations, '
    28: '²⁸ then they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who sent them into
      captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their land, and left
      none of them captive any longer. '
    29: ²⁹ And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I shall have poured
      out My Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord God.”
  40:
    1: '¹ In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year,
      on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured,
      on the very same day the hand of the Lord was upon me; and He took me there. '
    2: '² In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a
      very high mountain; on it toward the south was something like the structure
      of a city. '
    3: "³ He took me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like\
      \ the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his\
      \ hand, and he stood in the gateway. \n"
    4: '⁴ And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your
      ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here
      so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything
      you see.” '
    5: "⁵ Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s\
      \ hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth;\
      \ and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height,\
      \ one rod. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs
      and measured the threshold of the gateway, which was one rod wide, and the other
      threshold was one rod wide. '
    7: '⁷ Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers
      was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule
      of the inside gate was one rod. '
    8: '⁸ He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod. '
    9: '⁹ Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts,
      two cubits. The vestibule of the gate was on the inside. '
    10: "¹⁰ In the eastern gateway were three gate chambers on one side and three\
      \ on the other; the three were all the same size; also the gateposts were of\
      \ the same size on this side and that side. \n"
    11: '¹¹ He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; and
      the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. '
    12: '¹² There was a space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit on this side
      and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers were six cubits on this side and
      six cubits on that side. '
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one gate chamber to the
      roof of the other; the width was twenty-five cubits, as door faces door. '
    14: '¹⁴ He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around
      the gateway extended to the gatepost. '
    15: '¹⁵ From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the
      inner gate was fifty cubits. '
    16: "¹⁶ There were beveled window frames in the gate chambers and in their intervening\
      \ archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules.\
      \ There were windows all around on the inside. And on each gatepost were palm\
      \ trees. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then he brought me into the outer court; and there were chambers and a
      pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement. '
    18: '¹⁸ The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length
      of the gateways; this was the lower pavement. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the\
      \ front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and\
      \ the north. \n"
    20: '²⁰ On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its
      length and its width. '
    21: '²¹ Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts
      and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was
      fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    22: '²² Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, had the
      same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps,
      and its archway was in front of it. '
    23: "²³ A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the\
      \ eastern gateway; and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing
      south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements. '
    25: '²⁵ There were windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows;
      its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    26: '²⁶ Seven steps led up to it, and its archway was in front of them; and it
      had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side. '
    27: "²⁷ There was also a gateway on the inner court, facing south; and he measured\
      \ from gateway to gateway toward the south, one hundred cubits. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway; he
      measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements. '
    29: '²⁹ Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways were according
      to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its archways all
      around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    30: '³⁰ There were archways all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits
      wide. '
    31: "³¹ Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees were on its gateposts,\
      \ and going up to it were eight steps. \n"
    32: '³² And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gateway
      according to these same measurements. '
    33: '³³ Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways were according
      to these same measurements; and there were windows in it and in its archways
      all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    34: "³⁴ Its archways faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its gateposts\
      \ on this side and on that side; and going up to it were eight steps. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured it according to these
      same measurements— '
    36: '³⁶ also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways. It had windows
      all around; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    37: "³⁷ Its gateposts faced the outer court, palm trees were on its gateposts\
      \ on this side and on that side, and going up to it were eight steps. \n"
    38: '³⁸ There was a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway,
      where they washed the burnt offering. '
    39: '³⁹ In the vestibule of the gateway were two tables on this side and two tables
      on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the
      trespass offering. '
    40: '⁴⁰ At the outer side of the vestibule, as one goes up to the entrance of
      the northern gateway, were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule
      of the gateway were two tables. '
    41: '⁴¹ Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side
      of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices. '
    42: '⁴² There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one
      cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these
      they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and
      the sacrifice. '
    43: "⁴³ Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh\
      \ of the sacrifices was on the tables. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner
      court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing
      north at the side of the southern gateway. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Then he said to me, “This chamber which faces south is for the priests
      who have charge of the temple. '
    46: "⁴⁶ The chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the\
      \ altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the\
      \ Lord to minister to Him.” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits
      wide, foursquare. The altar was in front of the temple. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts
      of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and
      the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that
      side. '
    49: ⁴⁹ The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits;
      and by the steps which led up to it there were pillars by the doorposts, one
      on this side and another on that side.
  41:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, six cubits
      wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side—the width of the tabernacle. '
    2: "² The width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance\
      \ were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured\
      \ its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits. \n"
    3: '³ Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance,
      six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. '
    4: "⁴ He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond\
      \ the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Next, he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits. The width of each
      side chamber all around the temple was four cubits on every side. '
    6: '⁶ The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers
      in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side chambers all around,
      that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple. '
    7: '⁷ As one went up from story to story, the side chambers became wider all around,
      because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps;
      therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest
      story to the highest by way of the middle one. '
    8: '⁸ I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of
      the side chambers, a full rod, that is, six cubits high. '
    9: '⁹ The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits, and
      so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple. '
    10: '¹⁰ And between it and the wall chambers was a width of twenty cubits all
      around the temple on every side. '
    11: "¹¹ The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward\
      \ the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace was five\
      \ cubits all around. \n"
    12: "¹² The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end was\
      \ seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around,\
      \ and its length ninety cubits. \n"
    13: '¹³ So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separating
      courtyard with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long; '
    14: '¹⁴ also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating
      courtyard, was one hundred cubits. '
    15: '¹⁵ He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating
      courtyard, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred
      cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court, '
    16: '¹⁶ their doorposts and the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around
      their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground
      to the windows—the windows were covered— '
    17: "¹⁷ from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside,\
      \ and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub
      and cherub. Each cherub had two faces, '
    19: '¹⁹ so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the
      face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made
      throughout the temple all around. '
    20: "²⁰ From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary,\
      \ cherubim and palm trees were carved. \n"
    21: '²¹ The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary;
      their appearance was similar. '
    22: "²² The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its\
      \ corners, its length, and its sides were of wood; and he said to me, “This\
      \ is the table that is before the Lord.” \n"
    23: '²³ The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. '
    24: '²⁴ The doors had two panels apiece, two folding panels: two panels for one
      door and two panels for the other door. '
    25: '²⁵ Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just as
      they were carved on the walls. A wooden canopy was on the front of the vestibule
      outside. '
    26: ²⁶ There were beveled window frames and palm trees on one side and on the
      other, on the sides of the vestibule—also on the side chambers of the temple
      and on the canopies.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north;
      and he brought me into the chamber which was opposite the separating courtyard,
      and which was opposite the building toward the north. '
    2: '² Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits),
      was the north door. '
    3: '³ Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of
      the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. '
    4: '⁴ In front of the chambers, toward the inside, was a walk ten cubits wide,
      at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north. '
    5: '⁵ Now the upper chambers were shorter, because the galleries took away space
      from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building. '
    6: '⁶ For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars
      of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and
      middle levels from the ground up. '
    7: '⁷ And a wall which was outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front
      of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits. '
    8: '⁸ The length of the chambers toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas
      that facing the temple was one hundred cubits. '
    9: "⁹ At the lower chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into\
      \ them from the outer court. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Also there were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward
      the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building. '
    11: '¹¹ There was a walk in front of them also, and their appearance was like
      the chambers which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the
      others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan. '
    12: "¹² And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south,\
      \ as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walk, the way directly\
      \ in front of the wall toward the east. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which
      are opposite the separating courtyard, are the holy chambers where the priests
      who approach the Lord shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay
      the most holy offerings—the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass
      offering—for the place is holy. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy chamber\
      \ into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they\
      \ minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may\
      \ approach that which is for the people.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out
      through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around. '
    16: '¹⁶ He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by
      the measuring rod all around. '
    17: '¹⁷ He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all
      around. '
    18: '¹⁸ He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. '
    19: '¹⁹ He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the
      measuring rod. '
    20: ²⁰ He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred
      cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the common.
  43:
    1: '¹ Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east. '
    2: '² And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east.
      His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory. '
    3: '³ It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw—like the vision which
      I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which
      I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face. '
    4: '⁴ And the glory of the Lord came into the temple by way of the gate which
      faces toward the east. '
    5: "⁵ The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold,\
      \ the glory of the Lord filled the temple. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I heard Him speaking to me from the temple, while a man stood beside
      me. '
    7: '⁷ And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place
      of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of
      Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they
      nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their
      high places. '
    8: '⁸ When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My
      doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My holy name by the
      abominations which they committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger. '
    9: "⁹ Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away\
      \ from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may
      be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. '
    11: '¹¹ And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them
      the design of the temple and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its
      entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write
      it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances,
      and perform them. '
    12: "¹² This is the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding the mountaintop\
      \ is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple. \n"
    13: '¹³ “These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit
      and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all
      around its edge of one span. This is the height of the altar: '
    14: '¹⁴ from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width
      of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits;
      and the width of the ledge, one cubit. '
    15: '¹⁵ The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward
      from the hearth. '
    16: '¹⁶ The altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four
      corners; '
    17: "¹⁷ the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with\
      \ a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps\
      \ face toward the east.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord God: ‘These are the
      ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings
      on it, and for sprinkling blood on it. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites,
      who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me,’ says the Lord
      God. '
    20: '²⁰ ‘You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the
      altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you
      shall cleanse it and make atonement for it. '
    21: '²¹ Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it in
      the appointed place of the temple, outside the sanctuary. '
    22: '²² On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for
      a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the
      bull. '
    23: '²³ When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without
      blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish. '
    24: '²⁴ When you offer them before the Lord, the priests shall throw salt on them,
      and they will offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ Every day for seven days you shall prepare a goat for a sin offering;
      they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without
      blemish. '
    26: '²⁶ Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and
      so consecrate it. '
    27: ²⁷ When these days are over it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter,
      that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on
      the altar; and I will accept you,’ says the Lord God.”
  44:
    1: '¹ Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward
      the east, but it was shut. '
    2: '² And the Lord said to me, “This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened,
      and no man shall enter by it, because the Lord God of Israel has entered by
      it; therefore it shall be shut. '
    3: "³ As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread\
      \ before the Lord; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and\
      \ go out the same way.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple;
      so I looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord;
      and I fell on my face. '
    5: "⁵ And the Lord said to me, “Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and\
      \ hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of\
      \ the house of the Lord and all its laws. Mark well who may enter the house\
      \ and all who go out from the sanctuary. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Now say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord
      God: “O house of Israel, let Us have no more of all your abominations. '
    7: '⁷ When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised
      in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it—My house—and when you offered My
      food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your
      abominations. '
    8: '⁸ And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set others
      to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.” '
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord God: “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised\
      \ in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any foreigner who is among the\
      \ children of Israel. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed
      away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity. '
    11: '¹¹ Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, as gatekeepers of the house
      and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice
      for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. '
    12: '¹² Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house
      of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand in an oath
      against them,” says the Lord God, “that they shall bear their iniquity. '
    13: '¹³ And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest, nor come
      near any of My holy things, nor into the Most Holy Place; but they shall bear
      their shame and their abominations which they have committed. '
    14: "¹⁴ Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the temple, for all its work,\
      \ and for all that has to be done in it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My
      sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near
      Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat
      and the blood,” says the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ “They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to minister
      to Me, and they shall keep My charge. '
    17: '¹⁷ And it shall be, whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that
      they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister
      within the gates of the inner court or within the house. '
    18: '¹⁸ They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their
      bodies; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat. '
    19: "¹⁹ When they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people,\
      \ they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them\
      \ in the holy chambers, and put on other garments; and in their holy garments\
      \ they shall not sanctify the people. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “They shall neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but
      they shall keep their hair well trimmed. '
    21: '²¹ No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court. '
    22: "²² They shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman, but take virgins\
      \ of the descendants of the house of Israel, or widows of priests. \n"
    23: '²³ “And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the
      unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. '
    24: "²⁴ In controversy they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My\
      \ judgments. They shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed meetings,\
      \ and they shall hallow My Sabbaths. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person. Only for
      father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they
      defile themselves. '
    26: '²⁶ After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him. '
    27: "²⁷ And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary,\
      \ he must offer his sin offering in the inner court,” says the Lord God. \n"
    28: '²⁸ “It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, that I am their inheritance.
      You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession. '
    29: '²⁹ They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass
      offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. '
    30: '³⁰ The best of all firstfruits of any kind, and every sacrifice of any kind
      from all your sacrifices, shall be the priest’s; also you shall give to the
      priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house. '
    31: ³¹ The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally
      or was torn by wild beasts.
  45:
    1: '¹ “Moreover, when you divide the land by lot into inheritance, you shall set
      apart a district for the Lord, a holy section of the land; its length shall
      be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy
      throughout its territory all around. '
    2: '² Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by
      five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space. '
    3: '³ So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long
      and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. '
    4: '⁴ It shall be a holy section of the land, belonging to the priests, the ministers
      of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the Lord; it shall be a place
      for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. '
    5: "⁵ An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall belong\
      \ to the Levites, the ministers of the temple; they shall have twenty chambers\
      \ as a possession. \n"
    6: "⁶ “You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits\
      \ wide and twenty-five thousand long, adjacent to the district of the holy section;\
      \ it shall belong to the whole house of Israel. \n"
    7: '⁷ “The prince shall have a section on one side and the other of the holy district
      and the city’s property; and bordering on the holy district and the city’s property,
      extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length
      shall be side by side with one of the tribal portions, from the west border
      to the east border. '
    8: "⁸ The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My princes shall no more\
      \ oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of\
      \ Israel, according to their tribes.” \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Enough, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and
      plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people,”
      says the Lord God. '
    10: '¹⁰ “You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. '
    11: '¹¹ The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath
      contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure
      shall be according to the homer. '
    12: "¹² The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels,\
      \ and fifteen shekels shall be your mina. \n"
    13: '¹³ “This is the offering which you shall offer: you shall give one-sixth
      of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of
      barley. '
    14: '¹⁴ The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath
      from a kor. A kor is a homer or ten baths, for ten baths are a homer. '
    15: '¹⁵ And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the rich
      pastures of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and
      peace offerings, to make atonement for them,” says the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ “All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in
      Israel. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, grain offerings,\

    18: '¹⁸ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “In the first month, on the first day of the
      month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary. '
    19: '¹⁹ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it
      on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar,
      and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court. '
    20: "²⁰ And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has\
      \ sinned unintentionally or in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for\
      \ the temple. \n"
    21: '²¹ “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe
      the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. '
    22: '²² And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people
      of the land a bull for a sin offering. '
    23: '²³ On the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the
      Lord, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish, daily for seven days, and
      a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering. '
    24: "²⁴ And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one\
      \ ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah. \n"
    25: ²⁵ “In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast,
      he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt
      offering, the grain offering, and the oil.”
  46:
    1: '¹ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “The gateway of the inner court that faces toward
      the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be

    2: '² The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside,
      and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and
      his peace offerings. He shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he

    3: '³ Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the entrance to this gateway
      before the Lord on the Sabbaths and the New Moons. '
    4: '⁴ The burnt offering that the prince offers to the Lord on the Sabbath day
      shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish; '
    5: '⁵ and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering
      for the lambs, as much as he wants to give, as well as a hin of oil with every
      ephah. '
    6: '⁶ On the day of the New Moon it shall be a young bull without blemish, six
      lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish. '
    7: '⁷ He shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a
      ram, as much as he wants to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every

    8: "⁸ When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the vestibule of the gateway,\

    9: '⁹ “But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the appointed feast
      days, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way

      by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which
      he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate. '
    10: '¹⁰ The prince shall then be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go
      in; and when they go out, he shall go out. '

    13: '¹³ “You shall daily make a burnt offering to the Lord of a lamb of the first

    16: '¹⁶ ‘Thus says the Lord God: “If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance
      to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. '
    17: '¹⁷ But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants,
      it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the
      prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs. '
    18: "¹⁸ Moreover the prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by\
      \ evicting them from their property; he shall provide an inheritance for his\
      \ sons from his own property, so that none of My people may be scattered from\
      \ his property.” ’ ” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Now he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate,
      into the holy chambers of the priests which face toward the north; and there
      a place was situated at their extreme western end. '
    20: "²⁰ And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the\
      \ trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain\
      \ offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to sanctify\
      \ the people.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the
      four corners of the court; and in fact, in every corner of the court there was
      another court. '
    22: '²² In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long
      and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size. '
    23: '²³ There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the
      four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows of stones all around. '
    24: ²⁴ And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where the ministers of the temple
      shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”
  47:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was water,
      flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front
      of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of
      the temple, south of the altar. '
    2: "² He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside\
      \ to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on\
      \ the right side. \n"
    3: '³ And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured
      one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up
      to my ankles. '
    4: '⁴ Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water
      came up to my knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through;
      the water came up to my waist. '
    5: '⁵ Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross;
      for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could
      not be crossed. '
    6: "⁶ He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me and\
      \ returned me to the bank of the river. \n"
    7: '⁷ When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees
      on one side and the other. '
    8: '⁸ Then he said to me: “This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down
      into the valley, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are
      healed. '
    9: '⁹ And it shall be that every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers
      go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters
      go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river
      goes. '
    10: '¹⁰ It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim;
      they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same
      kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many. '
    11: '¹¹ But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over
      to salt. '
    12: "¹² Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds\
      \ of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will\
      \ not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from\
      \ the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine.”\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Thus says the Lord God: “These are the borders by which you shall divide
      the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have
      two portions. '
    14: "¹⁴ You shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand in\
      \ an oath to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your\
      \ inheritance. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “This shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea,
      by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad, '
    16: '¹⁶ Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and
      the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran). '
    17: "¹⁷ Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus;\
      \ and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north\
      \ side. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and\
      \ Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and\
      \ along the eastern side of the sea. This is the east side. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “The south side, toward the South, shall be from Tamar to the waters of\
      \ Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side,\
      \ toward the South. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “The west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until\
      \ one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side. \n"
    21: '²¹ “Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes
      of Israel. '
    22: '²² It shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves,
      and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you. They
      shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have
      an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. '
    23: ²³ And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger dwells, there you shall
      give him his inheritance,” says the Lord God.
  48:
    1: '¹ “Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the
      road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus
      northward, in the direction of Hamath, there shall be one section for Dan from
      its east to its west side; '
    2: '² by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one section for Asher; '
    3: '³ by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one section for

    5: '⁵ by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, one section for

    6: '⁶ by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, one section for
      Reuben; '
    7: '⁷ by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one section for
      Judah; '
    8: "⁸ by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the district\

      \ the sanctuary in the center. \n"
    9: '⁹ “The district that you shall set apart for the Lord shall be twenty-five
      thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width. '
    10: '¹⁰ To these—to the priests—the holy district shall belong: on the north twenty-five
      thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten
      thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. The sanctuary
      of the Lord shall be in the center. '
    11: '¹¹ It shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are sanctified,
      who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went
      astray, as the Levites went astray. '
    12: "¹² And this district of land that is set apart shall be to them a thing most\
      \ holy by the border of the Levites. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Opposite the border of the priests, the Levites shall have an area twenty-five
      thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length shall
      be twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand. '
    14: "¹⁴ And they shall not sell or exchange any of it; they may not alienate this\
      \ best part of the land, for it is holy to the Lord. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “The five thousand cubits in width that remain, along the edge of the
      twenty-five thousand, shall be for general use by the city, for dwellings and
      common-land; and the city shall be in the center. '
    16: '¹⁶ These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred
      cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand
      five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. '
    17: '¹⁷ The common-land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty
      cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty,
      and to the west two hundred and fifty. '
    18: '¹⁸ The rest of the length, alongside the district of the holy section, shall
      be ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be
      adjacent to the district of the holy section, and its produce shall be food
      for the workers of the city. '
    19: '¹⁹ The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate
      it. '
    20: "²⁰ The entire district shall be twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five\
      \ thousand cubits, foursquare. You shall set apart the holy district with the\
      \ property of the city. \n"
    21: '²¹ “The rest shall belong to the prince, on one side and on the other of
      the holy district and of the city’s property, next to the twenty-five thousand
      cubits of the holy district as far as the eastern border, and westward next
      to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the tribal
      portions; it shall belong to the prince. It shall be the holy district, and
      the sanctuary of the temple shall be in the center. '
    22: "²² Moreover, apart from the possession of the Levites and the possession\
      \ of the city which are in the midst of what belongs to the prince, the area\
      \ between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the\
      \ prince. \n"
    23: '²³ “As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin
      shall have one section; '
    24: '²⁴ by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon shall
      have one section; '

      Great Sea. '
    29: "²⁹ This is the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among\

    30: '³⁰ “These are the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand
      five hundred cubits '

      three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate
