Esther:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who
      reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia), '
    2: '² in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which
      was in Shushan the citadel, '
    3: '³ that in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials
      and servants—the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of
      the provinces being before him— '
    4: "⁴ when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his\
      \ excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days in all. \n"
    5: '⁵ And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven
      days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great
      to small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. '
    6: '⁶ There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen
      and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; and the couches were of gold and
      silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, turquoise, and white and black marble. '
    7: '⁷ And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from
      the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the generosity of the
      king. '
    8: "⁸ In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the\
      \ king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according\
      \ to each man’s pleasure. \n"
    9: "⁹ Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged\
      \ to King Ahasuerus. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he
      commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven
      eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, '
    11: '¹¹ to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing her royal crown, in order
      to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was beautiful to
      behold. '
    12: "¹² But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command brought by his\
      \ eunuchs; therefore the king was furious, and his anger burned within him.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this
      was the king’s manner toward all who knew law and justice, '
    14: '¹⁴ those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,
      Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access
      to the king’s presence, and who ranked highest in the kingdom): '
    15: "¹⁵ “What shall we do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she did not\
      \ obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs?” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: “Queen Vashti has
      not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who
      are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the queen’s behavior will become known to all women, so that they
      will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, ‘King Ahasuerus
      commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.’ '
    18: '¹⁸ This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the
      king’s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there
      will be excessive contempt and wrath. '
    19: '¹⁹ If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it
      be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will not be
      altered, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king
      give her royal position to another who is better than she. '
    20: "²⁰ When the king’s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all\
      \ his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great\
      \ and small.” \n"
    21: '²¹ And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according
      to the word of Memucan. '
    22: ²² Then he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its
      own script, and to every people in their own language, that each man should
      be master in his own house, and speak in the language of his own people.
  2:
    1: '¹ After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered
      Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her. '
    2: '² Then the king’s servants who attended him said: “Let beautiful young virgins
      be sought for the king; '
    3: '³ and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that
      they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into
      the women’s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian
      of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them. '
    4: "⁴ Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.”\n\
      This thing pleased the king, and he did so. \n"
    5: '⁵ In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the
      son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. '
    6: '⁶ Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been
      captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
      had carried away. '
    7: "⁷ And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter,\
      \ for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful.\
      \ When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. \n"
    8: '⁸ So it was, when the king’s command and decree were heard, and when many
      young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, under the custody of Hegai,
      that Esther also was taken to the king’s palace, into the care of Hegai the
      custodian of the women. '
    9: "⁹ Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily\
      \ gave beauty preparations to her, besides her allowance. Then seven choice\
      \ maidservants were provided for her from the king’s palace, and he moved her\
      \ and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged
      her not to reveal it. '
    11: "¹¹ And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women’s quarters,\
      \ to learn of Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her. \n"
    12: '¹² Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had
      completed twelve months’ preparation, according to the regulations for the women,
      for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil
      of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women. '
    13: '¹³ Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever
      she desired to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace. '
    14: "¹⁴ In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second\
      \ house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who kept\
      \ the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted\
      \ in her and called for her by name. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
      Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested
      nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised.
      And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her. '
    16: '¹⁶ So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth
      month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. '
    17: '¹⁷ The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained
      grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal
      crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials\
      \ and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts\
      \ according to the generosity of a king. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within
      the king’s gate. '
    20: "²⁰ Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai\
      \ had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was\
      \ brought up by him. \n"
    21: '²¹ In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king’s gate, two of the king’s
      eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands
      on King Ahasuerus. '
    22: '²² So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther
      informed the king in Mordecai’s name. '
    23: ²³ And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both
      were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in
      the presence of the king.
  3:
    1: '¹ After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha
      the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were
      with him. '
    2: '² And all the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate bowed and paid
      homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai
      would not bow or pay homage. '
    3: '³ Then the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate said to Mordecai,
      “Why do you transgress the king’s command?” '
    4: '⁴ Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to
      them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand;
      for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew. '
    5: '⁵ When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled
      with wrath. '
    6: "⁶ But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of\
      \ the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who\
      \ were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai. \n"
    7: "⁷ In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of\
      \ King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot), before Haman to determine\
      \ the day and the month, until it fell on the twelfth month, which is the month\
      \ of Adar. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered
      and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws
      are different from all other people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws.
      Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain. '
    9: "⁹ If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed,\
      \ and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who\
      \ do the work, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the
      son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. '
    11: "¹¹ And the king said to Haman, “The money and the people are given to you,\
      \ to do with them as seems good to you.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first
      month, and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the
      king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province, to the officials
      of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people
      in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed
      with the king’s signet ring. '
    13: '¹³ And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to
      destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little
      children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
      which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions. '
    14: '¹⁴ A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being
      published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. '
    15: ¹⁵ The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was
      proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink,
      but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
  4:
    1: '¹ When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put
      on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city. He cried out
      with a loud and bitter cry. '
    2: '² He went as far as the front of the king’s gate, for no one might enter the
      king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. '
    3: "³ And in every province where the king’s command and decree arrived, there\
      \ was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and\
      \ many lay in sackcloth and ashes. \n"
    4: '⁴ So Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply
      distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth
      away from him, but he would not accept them. '
    5: '⁵ Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed
      to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what
      and why this was. '
    6: '⁶ So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of
      the king’s gate. '
    7: '⁷ And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money
      that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries to destroy the Jews. '
    8: '⁸ He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which
      was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her,
      and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him
      and plead before him for her people. '
    9: "⁹ So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai: '
    11: '¹¹ “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that
      any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been
      called, he has but one law: put all to death, except the one to whom the king
      holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called
      to go in to the king these thirty days.” '
    12: "¹² So they told Mordecai Esther’s words. \n"
    13: '¹³ And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: “Do not think in your heart that
      you will escape in the king’s palace any more than all the other Jews. '
    14: "¹⁴ For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance\
      \ will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house\
      \ will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a\
      \ time as this?” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai: '
    16: "¹⁶ “Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me;\
      \ neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast\
      \ likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I\
      \ perish, I perish!” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded
      him.
  5:
    1: '¹ Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and
      stood in the inner court of the king’s palace, across from the king’s house,
      while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance
      of the house. '
    2: "² So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she\
      \ found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter\
      \ that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ And the king said to her, “What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your\
      \ request? It shall be given to you—up to half the kingdom!” \n"
    4: "⁴ So Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come\
      \ today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.”\
      \ So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. \n"
    6: "⁶ At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, “What is your petition?\
      \ It shall be granted you. What is your request, up to half the kingdom? It\
      \ shall be done!” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and request is this: '
    8: "⁸ If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king\
      \ to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come\
      \ to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the\
      \ king has said.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman
      saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before
      him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai. '
    10: '¹⁰ Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called
      for his friends and his wife Zeresh. '
    11: "¹¹ Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children,\
      \ everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him\
      \ above the officials and servants of the king. \n"
    12: '¹² Moreover Haman said, “Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come
      in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited
      by her, along with the king. '
    13: "¹³ Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting\
      \ at the king’s gate.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be\
      \ made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai\
      \ be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.”\nAnd the thing\
      \ pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made."
  6:
    1: '¹ That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book
      of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. '
    2: '² And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh,
      two of the king’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King
      Ahasuerus. '
    3: "³ Then the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai\
      \ for this?”\nAnd the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been\
      \ done for him.” \n"
    4: "⁴ So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the\
      \ outer court of the king’s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on\
      \ the gallows that he had prepared for him. \n"
    5: "⁵ The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.”\n\
      And the king said, “Let him come in.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So Haman came in, and the king asked him, “What shall be done for the man\
      \ whom the king delights to honor?”\nNow Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would\
      \ the king delight to honor more than me?” "
    7: '⁷ And Haman answered the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor, '
    8: '⁸ let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which
      the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head. '
    9: "⁹ Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s\
      \ most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor.\
      \ Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before\
      \ him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’ ”\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you\
      \ have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king’s\
      \ gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on\
      \ horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall\
      \ it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!” \n"
    12: '¹² Afterward Mordecai went back to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to
      his house, mourning and with his head covered. '
    13: "¹³ When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had\
      \ happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai,\
      \ before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail\
      \ against him but will surely fall before him.” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hastened
      to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
  7:
    1: '¹ So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. '
    2: "² And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther,\
      \ “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is\
      \ your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!” \n"
    3: '³ Then Queen Esther answered and said, “If I have found favor in your sight,
      O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition,
      and my people at my request. '
    4: "⁴ For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and\
      \ to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have\
      \ held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where\
      \ is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?” \n"
    6: "⁶ And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman!”\nSo Haman\
      \ was terrified before the king and queen. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into
      the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life,
      for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. '
    8: "⁸ When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet\
      \ of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was. Then the king\
      \ said, “Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house?”\nAs the word\
      \ left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. "
    9: "⁹ Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, “Look! The gallows,\
      \ fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king’s\
      \ behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.”\nThen the king said, “Hang him\
      \ on it!” \n"
    10: ¹⁰ So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.
      Then the king’s wrath subsided.
  8:
    1: '¹ On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy
      of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he was
      related to her. '
    2: "² So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and\
      \ gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored
      him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which
      he had devised against the Jews. '
    4: '⁴ And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose
      and stood before the king, '
    5: '⁵ and said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight
      and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it
      be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the
      Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces. '
    6: "⁶ For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how\
      \ can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Indeed,
      I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows
      because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews. '
    8: "⁸ You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews, as you please, in the\
      \ king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for whatever is written\
      \ in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring no one can revoke.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which
      is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according
      to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and
      the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven
      provinces in all, to every province in its own script, to every people in their
      own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. '
    10: "¹⁰ And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s\
      \ signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses\
      \ bred from swift steeds. \n"
    11: '¹¹ By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to
      gather together and protect their lives—to destroy, kill, and annihilate all
      the forces of any people or province that would assault them, both little children
      and women, and to plunder their possessions, '
    12: '¹² on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day
      of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. '
    13: '¹³ A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province
      and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to
      avenge themselves on their enemies. '
    14: "¹⁴ The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on\
      \ by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of
      blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple;
      and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. '
    16: '¹⁶ The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor. '
    17: ¹⁷ And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree
      came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the
      people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth
      day, the time came for the king’s command and his decree to be executed. On
      the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite
      occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them. '
    2: '² The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces
      of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could
      withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people. '
    3: '³ And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and
      all those doing the king’s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai
      fell upon them. '
    4: '⁴ For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout
      all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent. '
    5: "⁵ Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with\
      \ slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated\
      \ them. \n"
    6: '⁶ And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. '
    7: '⁷ Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, '
    8: '⁸ Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, '
    9: '⁹ Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha— '
    10: "¹⁰ the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews—they\
      \ killed; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. \n"
    11: '¹¹ On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel
      was brought to the king. '
    12: "¹² And the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed\
      \ five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have\
      \ they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition?\
      \ It shall be granted to you. Or what is your further request? It shall be done.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews\
      \ who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let\
      \ Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan,\
      \ and they hanged Haman’s ten sons. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth\
      \ day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they\
      \ did not lay a hand on the plunder. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The remainder of the Jews in the king’s provinces gathered together and
      protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five
      thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. '
    17: "¹⁷ This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth\
      \ of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth
      day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested,
      and made it a day of feasting and gladness. '
    19: "¹⁹ Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated\
      \ the fourteenth day of the month of Adar with gladness and feasting, as a holiday,\
      \ and for sending presents to one another. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near
      and far, who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, '
    21: '²¹ to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth
      and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, '
    22: '²² as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month
      which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday;
      that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to
      one another and gifts to the poor. '
    23: '²³ So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had
      written to them, '
    24: '²⁴ because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the
      Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that
      is, the lot), to consume them and destroy them; '
    25: "²⁵ but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letter that this\
      \ wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his\
      \ own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. \n"
    26: '²⁶ So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because
      of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter,
      and what had happened to them, '
    27: '²⁷ the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants
      and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two
      days every year, according to the written instructions and according to the
      prescribed time, '
    28: "²⁸ that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation,\
      \ every family, every province, and every city, that these days of Purim should\
      \ not fail to be observed among the Jews, and that the memory of them should\
      \ not perish among their descendants. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote
      with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. '
    30: '³⁰ And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven
      provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, '
    31: '³¹ to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time, as Mordecai the
      Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves
      and their descendants concerning matters of their fasting and lamenting. '
    32: ³² So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written
      in the book.
  10:
    1: '¹ And King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the islands of the
      sea. '
    2: '² Now all the acts of his power and his might, and the account of the greatness
      of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book
      of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? '
    3: ³ For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and was great among the
      Jews and well received by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of
      his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen.
