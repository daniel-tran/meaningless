    15: '¹⁵ Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri,
      the son of Asaph; '
    16: "¹⁶ Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and\
      \ Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of\
      \ the Netophathites. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren.
      Shallum was the chief. '
    18: "¹⁸ Until then they had been gatekeepers for the camps of the children of\
      \ Levi at the King’s Gate on the east. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his
      brethren, from his father’s house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work
      of the service, gatekeepers of the tabernacle. Their fathers had been keepers
      of the entrance to the camp of the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ And Phinehas the son of Eleazar had been the officer over them in time
      past; the Lord was with him. '
    21: "²¹ Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was keeper of the door of the tabernacle\
      \ of meeting. \n"
    22: '²² All those chosen as gatekeepers were two hundred and twelve. They were
      recorded by their genealogy, in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had
      appointed them to their trusted office. '
    23: '²³ So they and their children were in charge of the gates of the house of
      the Lord, the house of the tabernacle, by assignment. '
    24: '²⁴ The gatekeepers were assigned to the four directions: the east, west,
      north, and south. '
    25: '²⁵ And their brethren in their villages had to come with them from time to
      time for seven days. '
    26: '²⁶ For in this trusted office were four chief gatekeepers; they were Levites.
      And they had charge over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. '
    27: "²⁷ And they lodged all around the house of God because they had the responsibility,\
      \ and they were in charge of opening it every morning. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Now some of them were in charge of the serving vessels, for they brought
      them in and took them out by count. '
    29: '²⁹ Some of them were appointed over the furnishings and over all the implements
      of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the incense
      and the spices. '
    30: "³⁰ And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. \n"
    31: '³¹ Mattithiah of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had
      the trusted office over the things that were baked in the pans. '
    32: "³² And some of their brethren of the sons of the Kohathites were in charge\
      \ of preparing the showbread for every Sabbath. \n"
    33: '³³ These are the singers, heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites, who
      lodged in the chambers, and were free from other duties; for they were employed
      in that work day and night. '
    34: "³⁴ These heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites were heads throughout\
      \ their generations. They dwelt at Jerusalem. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose wife’s name was Maacah, dwelt at Gibeon. '
    36: '³⁶ His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, '
    37: '³⁷ Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. '
    38: '³⁸ And Mikloth begot Shimeam. They also dwelt alongside their relatives in
      Jerusalem, with their brethren. '
    39: '³⁹ Ner begot Kish, Kish begot Saul, and Saul begot Jonathan, Malchishua,
      Abinadab, and Esh-Baal. '
    40: '⁴⁰ The son of Jonathan was Merib-Baal, and Merib-Baal begot Micah. '
    41: '⁴¹ The sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. '
    42: '⁴² And Ahaz begot Jarah; Jarah begot Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri
      begot Moza; '
    43: "⁴³ Moza begot Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son.\
      \ \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ And Azel had six sons whose names were these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael,
      Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.'
  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from
      before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines
      killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons. '
    3: '³ The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was wounded
      by the archers. '
    4: '⁴ Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through
      with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and abuse me.” But his armorbearer
      would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on
      it. '
    5: '⁵ And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword
      and died. '
    6: '⁶ So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together. '
    7: "⁷ And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had\
      \ fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled;\
      \ then the Philistines came and dwelt in them. \n"
    8: '⁸ So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain,
      that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent word throughout
      the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols
      and among the people. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his\
      \ head in the temple of Dagon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to
      Saul, '
    12: "¹² all the valiant men arose and took the body of Saul and the bodies of\
      \ his sons; and they brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the\
      \ tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the
      Lord, because he did not keep the word of the Lord, and also because he consulted
      a medium for guidance. '
    14: ¹⁴ But he did not inquire of the Lord; therefore He killed him, and turned
      the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then all Israel came together to David at Hebron, saying, “Indeed we are
      your bone and your flesh. '
    2: '² Also, in time past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel
      out and brought them in; and the Lord your God said to you, ‘You shall shepherd
      My people Israel, and be ruler over My people Israel.’ ” '
    3: "³ Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David\
      \ made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David\
      \ king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites
      were, the inhabitants of the land. '
    5: '⁵ But the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come in here!”
      Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David). '
    6: '⁶ Now David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and
      captain.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief. '
    7: '⁷ Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of
      David. '
    8: '⁸ And he built the city around it, from the Millo to the surrounding area.
      Joab repaired the rest of the city. '
    9: "⁹ So David went on and became great, and the Lord of hosts was with him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now these were the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened\
      \ themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according\
      \ to the word of the Lord concerning Israel. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the\
      \ son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against\
      \ three hundred, killed by him at one time. \n"
    12: '¹² After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the
      three mighty men. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David at Pasdammim. Now there the Philistines were gathered
      for battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley. So the people fled
      from the Philistines. '
    14: "¹⁴ But they stationed themselves in the middle of that field, defended it,\
      \ and killed the Philistines. So the Lord brought about a great victory. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into
      the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley
      of Rephaim. '
    16: '¹⁶ David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines
      was then in Bethlehem. '
    17: '¹⁷ And David said with longing, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of
      water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” '
    18: '¹⁸ So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from
      the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David.
      Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ And he said, “Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall\
      \ I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For at\
      \ the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it.\
      \ These things were done by the three mighty men. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted
      up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these
      three. '
    21: "²¹ Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he\
      \ became their captain. However he did not attain to the first three. \n"
    22: '²² Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel,
      who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also
      had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day. '
    23: '²³ And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, five cubits tall. In
      the Egyptian’s hand there was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down
      to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed
      him with his own spear. '
    24: '²⁴ These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three
      mighty men. '
    25: "²⁵ Indeed he was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the\
      \ first three. And David appointed him over his guard. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Also the mighty warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the
      son of Dodo of Bethlehem, '
    27: '²⁷ Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, '
    28: '²⁸ Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, '
    29: '²⁹ Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, '
    30: '³⁰ Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, '
    31: '³¹ Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the
      Pirathonite, '
    32: '³² Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, '
    33: '³³ Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, '
    34: '³⁴ the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite, '
    35: '³⁵ Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, '
    36: '³⁶ Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, '
    37: '³⁷ Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, '
    38: '³⁸ Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, '
    39: '³⁹ Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armorbearer of Joab the
      son of Zeruiah), '
    40: '⁴⁰ Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, '
    41: '⁴¹ Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, '
    42: '⁴² Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites) and thirty
      with him, '
    43: '⁴³ Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite, '
    44: '⁴⁴ Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, '
    45: '⁴⁵ Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, '
    46: '⁴⁶ Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the
      Moabite, '
    47: ⁴⁷ Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still a
      fugitive from Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helpers
      in the war, '
    2: "² armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left in hurling stones\
      \ and shooting arrows with the bow. They were of Benjamin, Saul’s brethren.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel
      and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite; '
    4: '⁴ Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty;
      Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; '
    5: '⁵ Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite; '
    6: '⁶ Elkanah, Jisshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; '
    7: "⁷ and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. \n"
    8: '⁸ Some Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men
      of valor, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces
      were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains: '
    9: '⁹ Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, '
    10: '¹⁰ Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, '
    11: '¹¹ Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, '
    12: '¹² Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, '
    13: '¹³ Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh. '
    14: '¹⁴ These were from the sons of Gad, captains of the army; the least was over
      a hundred, and the greatest was over a thousand. '
    15: "¹⁵ These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it\
      \ had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all those in the valleys,\
      \ to the east and to the west. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. '
    17: '¹⁷ And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, “If you
      have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but
      if to betray me to my enemies, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the
      God of our fathers look and bring judgment.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the captains, and he said:\n\
      “We are yours, O David;\nWe are on your side, O son of Jesse!\nPeace, peace\
      \ to you,\nAnd peace to your helpers!\nFor your God helps you.”\nSo David received\
      \ them, and made them captains of the troop. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And some from Manasseh defected to David when he was going with the Philistines
      to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines
      sent him away by agreement, saying, “He may defect to his master Saul and endanger
      our heads.” '
    20: '²⁰ When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah,
      Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands
      who were from Manasseh. '
    21: '²¹ And they helped David against the bands of raiders, for they were all
      mighty men of valor, and they were captains in the army. '
    22: "²² For at that time they came to David day by day to help him, until it was\
      \ a great army, like the army of God. \n"
    23: '²³ Now these were the numbers of the divisions that were equipped for war,
      and came to David at Hebron to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according
      to the word of the Lord: '
    24: '²⁴ of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred
      armed for war; '
    25: '²⁵ of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor fit for war, seven thousand
      one hundred; '
    26: '²⁶ of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred; '
    27: '²⁷ Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand seven
      hundred; '
    28: '²⁸ Zadok, a young man, a valiant warrior, and from his father’s house twenty-two
      captains; '
    29: '²⁹ of the sons of Benjamin, relatives of Saul, three thousand (until then
      the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul); '
    30: '³⁰ of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor,
      famous men throughout their father’s house; '
    31: '³¹ of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by
      name to come and make David king; '
    32: '³² of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what
      Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were
      at their command; '
    33: '³³ of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who went out to battle, expert in
      war with all weapons of war, stouthearted men who could keep ranks; '
    34: '³⁴ of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven thousand
      with shield and spear; '
    35: '³⁵ of the Danites who could keep battle formation, twenty-eight thousand
      six hundred; '
    36: '³⁶ of Asher, those who could go out to war, able to keep battle formation,
      forty thousand; '
    37: "³⁷ of the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from\
      \ the other side of the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle\
      \ with every kind of weapon of war. \n"
    38: '³⁸ All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a loyal
      heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were of
      one mind to make David king. '
    39: '³⁹ And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their
      brethren had prepared for them. '
    40: ⁴⁰ Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and
      Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and
      oxen—provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil
      and oxen and sheep abundantly, for there was joy in Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ Then David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with
      every leader. '
    2: '² And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you,
      and if it is of the Lord our God, let us send out to our brethren everywhere
      who are left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites
      who are in their cities and their common-lands, that they may gather together
      to us; '
    3: '³ and let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we have not inquired
      at it since the days of Saul.” '
    4: "⁴ Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right\
      \ in the eyes of all the people. \n"
    5: '⁵ So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor in Egypt to as far as
      the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim. '
    6: '⁶ And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim, which belonged
      to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, who dwells between
      the cherubim, where His name is proclaimed. '
    7: '⁷ So they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab,
      and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. '
    8: "⁸ Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might,\
      \ with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals,\
      \ and with trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ And when they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to
      hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against Uzza, and He struck him
      because he put his hand to the ark; and he died there before God. '
    11: '¹¹ And David became angry because of the Lord’s outbreak against Uzza; therefore
      that place is called Perez Uzza to this day. '
    12: "¹² David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of\
      \ God to me?” \n"
    13: '¹³ So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David, but took
      it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. '
    14: ¹⁴ The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three
      months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.
  14:
    1: '¹ Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, with masons
      and carpenters, to build him a house. '
    2: "² So David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, for\
      \ his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel. \n"
    3: '³ Then David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters. '
    4: '⁴ And these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua,
      Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all
      Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of
      it and went out against them. '
    9: '⁹ Then the Philistines went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim. '
    10: "¹⁰ And David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines?\
      \ Will You deliver them into my hand?”\nThe Lord said to him, “Go up, for I\
      \ will deliver them into your hand.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. Then David
      said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.”
      Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim. '
    12: "¹² And when they left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they\
      \ were burned with fire. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Philistines once again made a raid on the valley. '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall
      not go up after them; circle around them, and come upon them in front of the
      mulberry trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the
      mulberry trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before
      you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So David did as God commanded him, and they drove back the army of the
      Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the
      fear of him upon all nations.
  15:
    1: '¹ David built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place
      for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it. '
    2: '² Then David said, “No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the
      Lord has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to minister before Him forever.” '
    3: '³ And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark
      of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it. '
    4: '⁴ Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites: '
    5: '⁵ of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his
      brethren; '
    6: '⁶ of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his
      brethren; '
    7: '⁷ of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his
      brethren; '
    8: '⁸ of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his brethren; '
    9: '⁹ of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of his brethren; '
    10: "¹⁰ of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve\
      \ of his brethren. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites:
      for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. '
    12: '¹² He said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites;
      sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of
      the Lord God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it. '
    13: "¹³ For because you did not do it the first time, the Lord our God broke out\
      \ against us, because we did not consult Him about the proper order.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark
      of the Lord God of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders,\
      \ by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren
      to be the singers accompanied by instruments of music, stringed instruments,
      harps, and cymbals, by raising the voice with resounding joy. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph
      the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren, the sons of Merari, Ethan the son
      of Kushaiah; '
    18: '¹⁸ and with them their brethren of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel,
      Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh,
      Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers; '
    19: '¹⁹ the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound the cymbals of bronze; '
    20: '²⁰ Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
      with strings according to Alamoth; '
    21: '²¹ Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct
      with harps on the Sheminith; '
    22: '²² Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor in charge of the music,
      because he was skillful; '
    23: '²³ Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark; '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer,\
      \ the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom\
      \ and Jehiah, doorkeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to
      bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-Edom with
      joy. '
    26: '²⁶ And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams. '
    27: '²⁷ David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who
      bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music master with the singers.
      David also wore a linen ephod. '
    28: "²⁸ Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting\
      \ and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, making music\
      \ with stringed instruments and harps. \n"
    29: ²⁹ And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City
      of David, that Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King
      David whirling and playing music; and she despised him in her heart.
  16:
    1: '¹ So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle
      that David had erected for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
      before God. '
    2: '² And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings,
      he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone\
      \ a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. \n"
    4: '⁴ And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord,
      to commemorate, to thank, and to praise the Lord God of Israel: '
    5: '⁵ Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
      Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom: Jeiel with stringed instruments and
      harps, but Asaph made music with cymbals; '
    6: "⁶ Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests regularly blew the trumpets before the\
      \ ark of the covenant of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ On that day David first delivered this psalm into the hand of Asaph and\
      \ his brethren, to thank the Lord: \n"
    8: "⁸ Oh, give thanks to the Lord!\nCall upon His name;\nMake known His deeds\
      \ among the peoples!\n"
    9: "⁹ Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him;\nTalk of all His wondrous works!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Glory in His holy name;\nLet the hearts of those rejoice who seek the\
      \ Lord!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Seek the Lord and His strength;\nSeek His face evermore!\n"
    12: "¹² Remember His marvelous works which He has done,\nHis wonders, and the\
      \ judgments of His mouth,\n"
    13: "¹³ O seed of Israel His servant,\nYou children of Jacob, His chosen ones!\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God;\nHis judgments are in all the earth.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Remember His covenant forever,\nThe word which He commanded, for a thousand\
      \ generations,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The covenant which He made with Abraham,\nAnd His oath to Isaac,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,\nTo Israel for an everlasting\
      \ covenant,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan\nAs the allotment of your\
      \ inheritance,”\n"
    19: "¹⁹ When you were few in number,\nIndeed very few, and strangers in it. \n"
    20: "²⁰ When they went from one nation to another,\nAnd from one kingdom to another\
      \ people,\n"
    21: "²¹ He permitted no man to do them wrong;\nYes, He rebuked kings for their\
      \ sakes,\n"
    22: "²² Saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones,\nAnd do My prophets no harm.”\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Sing to the Lord, all the earth;\nProclaim the good news of His salvation\
      \ from day to day.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Declare His glory among the nations,\nHis wonders among all peoples. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised;\nHe is also to be feared\
      \ above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For all the gods of the peoples are idols,\nBut the Lord made the heavens.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Honor and majesty are before Him;\nStrength and gladness are in His place.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Give to the Lord, O families of the peoples,\nGive to the Lord glory and\
      \ strength.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Give to the Lord the glory due His name;\nBring an offering, and come\
      \ before Him.\nOh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!\n"
    30: "³⁰ Tremble before Him, all the earth.\nThe world also is firmly established,\n\
      It shall not be moved. \n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;\nAnd let them say\
      \ among the nations, “The Lord reigns.”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea roar, and all its fullness;\nLet the field rejoice, and all\
      \ that is in it.\n"
    33: "³³ Then the trees of the woods shall rejoice before the Lord,\nFor He is\
      \ coming to judge the earth. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!\nFor His mercy endures forever.\n"
    35: "³⁵ And say, “Save us, O God of our salvation;\nGather us together, and deliver\
      \ us from the Gentiles,\nTo give thanks to Your holy name,\nTo triumph in Your\
      \ praise.” \n"
    36: "³⁶ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel\nFrom everlasting to everlasting!\n\
      And all the people said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. \n"
    37: '³⁷ So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord to minister before the ark regularly, as every day’s work required; '
    38: '³⁸ and Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brethren, including Obed-Edom the son
      of Jeduthun, and Hosah, to be gatekeepers; '
    39: '³⁹ and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle
      of the Lord at the high place that was at Gibeon, '
    40: '⁴⁰ to offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly
      morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the Law of
      the Lord which He commanded Israel; '
    41: '⁴¹ and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were
      designated by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because His mercy endures forever; '
    42: "⁴² and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals\
      \ and the musical instruments of God. Now the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.\
      \ \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people departed, every man to his house; and David returned
      to bless his house.
  17:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass, when David was dwelling in his house, that David said\
      \ to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark\
      \ of the covenant of the Lord is under tent curtains.” \n"
    2: "² Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with\
      \ you.” \n"
    3: '³ But it happened that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: “You shall not build
      Me a house to dwell in. '
    5: '⁵ For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought up Israel,
      even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to
      another. '
    6: '⁶ Wherever I have moved about with all Israel, have I ever spoken a word to
      any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying,
      ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ '
    7: '⁷ Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord
      of hosts: “I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler
      over My people Israel. '
    8: '⁸ And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your
      enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great
      men who are on the earth. '
    9: '⁹ Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them,
      that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the
      sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, '
    10: '¹⁰ since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. Also
      I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the Lord will build
      you a house. '
    11: '¹¹ And it shall be, when your days are fulfilled, when you must go to be
      with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who will be of your
      sons; and I will establish his kingdom. '
    12: '¹² He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy
      away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. '
    14: "¹⁴ And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his\
      \ throne shall be established forever.” ’ ” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan\
      \ spoke to David. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then King David went in and sat before the Lord; and he said: “Who am
      I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? '
    17: '¹⁷ And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; and You have also
      spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded
      me according to the rank of a man of high degree, O Lord God. '
    18: '¹⁸ What more can David say to You for the honor of Your servant? For You
      know Your servant. '
    19: '¹⁹ O Lord, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You
      have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. '
    20: '²⁰ O Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according
      to all that we have heard with our ears. '
    21: '²¹ And who is like Your people Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God
      went to redeem for Himself as a people—to make for Yourself a name by great
      and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed
      from Egypt? '
    22: "²² For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and\
      \ You, Lord, have become their God. \n"
    23: '²³ “And now, O Lord, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant
      and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as You have
      said. '
    24: '²⁴ So let it be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying,
      ‘The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God.’ And let the house of
      Your servant David be established before You. '
    25: '²⁵ For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him
      a house. Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray before You. '
    26: '²⁶ And now, Lord, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant. '
    27: ²⁷ Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may
      continue before You forever; for You have blessed it, O Lord, and it shall be
      blessed forever.”
  18:
    1: '¹ After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines, subdued
      them, and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines. '
    2: "² Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought\
      \ tribute. \n"
    3: '³ And David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went
      to establish his power by the River Euphrates. '
    4: "⁴ David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and\
      \ twenty thousand foot soldiers. Also David hamstrung all the chariot horses,\
      \ except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots. \n"
    5: '⁵ When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David
      killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians. '
    6: '⁶ Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s
      servants, and brought tribute. So the Lord preserved David wherever he went. '
    7: '⁷ And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer,
      and brought them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ Also from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought a large\
      \ amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and\
      \ the articles of bronze. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of
      Hadadezer king of Zobah, '
    10: '¹⁰ he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because
      he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at
      war with Tou); and Hadoram brought with him all kinds of articles of gold, silver,
      and bronze. '
    11: "¹¹ King David also dedicated these to the Lord, along with the silver and\
      \ gold that he had brought from all these nations—from Edom, from Moab, from\
      \ the people of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites
      in the Valley of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ He also put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants.\
      \ And the Lord preserved David wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel, and administered judgment and justice
      to all his people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud
      was recorder; '
    16: '¹⁶ Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests;
      Shavsha was the scribe; '
    17: ¹⁷ Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
      and David’s sons were chief ministers at the king’s side.
  19:
    1: '¹ It happened after this that Nahash the king of the people of Ammon died,
      and his son reigned in his place. '
    2: "² Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because\
      \ his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him\
      \ concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the\
      \ people of Ammon to comfort him. \n"
    3: "³ And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that\
      \ David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Did\
      \ his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the\
      \ land?” \n"
    4: '⁴ Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments
      in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away. '
    5: "⁵ Then some went and told David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because\
      \ the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Wait at Jericho until your\
      \ beards have grown, and then return.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to
      David, Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire
      for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Syrian Maacah, and
      from Zobah. '
    7: "⁷ So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king\
      \ of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the people\
      \ of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle. \n"
    8: '⁸ Now when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty
      men. '
    9: "⁹ Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before\
      \ the gate of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the\
      \ field. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind,
      he chose some of Israel’s best and put them in battle array against the Syrians. '
    11: '¹¹ And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother,
      and they set themselves in battle array against the people of Ammon. '
    12: '¹² Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help
      me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. '
    13: "¹³ Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities\
      \ of our God. And may the Lord do what is good in His sight.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against
      the Syrians, and they fled before him. '
    15: "¹⁵ When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also\
      \ fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent
      messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River, and Shophach the
      commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them. '
    17: '¹⁷ When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan
      and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. So when David had
      set up in battle array against the Syrians, they fought with him. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand charioteers
      and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander
      of the army. '
    19: ¹⁹ And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel,
      they made peace with David and became his servants. So the Syrians were not
      willing to help the people of Ammon anymore.
  20:
    1: '¹ It happened in the spring of the year, at the time kings go out to battle,
      that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the country of the people of
      Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab
      defeated Rabbah and overthrew it. '
    2: '² Then David took their king’s crown from his head, and found it to weigh
      a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on David’s
      head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance. '
    3: "³ And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with\
      \ saws, with iron picks, and with axes. So David did to all the cities of the\
      \ people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now it happened afterward that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines,\
      \ at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the sons\
      \ of the giant. And they were subdued. \n"
    5: "⁵ Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed\
      \ Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like\
      \ a weaver’s beam. \n"
    6: '⁶ Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature,
      with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and
      he also was born to the giant. '
    7: "⁷ So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed\
      \ him. \n"
    8: ⁸ These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David
      and by the hand of his servants.
  21:
    1: '¹ Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. '
    2: "² So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel\
      \ from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know\
      \ it.” \n"
    3: "³ And Joab answered, “May the Lord make His people a hundred times more than\
      \ they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why\
      \ then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in\
      \ Israel?” \n"
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed
      and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. '
    5: '⁵ Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel
      had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four
      hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword. '
    6: "⁶ But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was\
      \ abominable to Joab. \n"
    7: '⁷ And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel. '
    8: "⁸ So David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing;\
      \ but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very\
      \ foolishly.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, '
    10: "¹⁰ “Go and tell David, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I offer you three things;\
      \ choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.” ’ ” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Choose for
      yourself, '
    12: "¹² either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes\
      \ with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the\
      \ sword of the Lord—the plague in the land, with the angel of the Lord destroying\
      \ throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what answer I should\
      \ take back to Him who sent me.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into\
      \ the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall\
      \ into the hand of man.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel
      fell. '
    15: "¹⁵ And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying,\
      \ the Lord looked and relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who was\
      \ destroying, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the Lord\
      \ stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between
      earth and heaven, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem.
      So David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. '
    17: "¹⁷ And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered?\
      \ I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have\
      \ they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O Lord my God, be against me and my father’s\
      \ house, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore, the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David
      should go and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the
      Jebusite. '
    19: '¹⁹ So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of
      the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him
      hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat. '
    21: '²¹ So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out
      from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with his face to the ground. '
    22: "²² Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the place of this threshing floor,\
      \ that I may build an altar on it to the Lord. You shall grant it to me at the\
      \ full price, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.” \n"
    23: "²³ But Ornan said to David, “Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king\
      \ do what is good in his eyes. Look, I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings,\
      \ the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I\
      \ give it all.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy it for the full
      price, for I will not take what is yours for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings
      with that which costs me nothing.” '
    25: '²⁵ So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. '
    26: "²⁶ And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings\
      \ and peace offerings, and called on the Lord; and He answered him from heaven\
      \ by fire on the altar of burnt offering. \n"
    27: "²⁷ So the Lord commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing
      floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. '
    29: '²⁹ For the tabernacle of the Lord and the altar of the burnt offering, which
      Moses had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Gibeon. '
    30: ³⁰ But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of
      the sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then David said, “This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar
      of burnt offering for Israel.” '
    2: '² So David commanded to gather the aliens who were in the land of Israel;
      and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God. '
    3: '³ And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates
      and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond measure, '
    4: "⁴ and cedar trees in abundance; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought\
      \ much cedar wood to David. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house\
      \ to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious\
      \ throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made\
      \ abundant preparations before his death. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for
      the Lord God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ And David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build
      a house to the name of the Lord my God; '
    8: '⁸ but the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and
      have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have
      shed much blood on the earth in My sight. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will
      give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for
      I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will
      be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ '
    11: '¹¹ Now, my son, may the Lord be with you; and may you prosper, and build
      the house of the Lord your God, as He has said to you. '
    12: '¹² Only may the Lord give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge
      concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the Lord your God. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments
      with which the Lord charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage;
      do not fear nor be dismayed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the Lord
      one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and
      bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have prepared timber
      and stone also, and you may add to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters,
      and all types of skillful men for every kind of work. '
    16: "¹⁶ Of gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no limit. Arise and begin\
      \ working, and the Lord be with you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son,
      saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Is not the Lord your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every
      side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land
      is subdued before the Lord and before His people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God. Therefore arise
      and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for
      the name of the Lord.”
  23:
    1: "¹ So when David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over\
      \ Israel. \n"
    2: '² And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and
      the Levites. '
    3: '³ Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above; and
      the number of individual males was thirty-eight thousand. '
    4: '⁴ Of these, twenty-four thousand were to look after the work of the house
      of the Lord, six thousand were officers and judges, '
    5: "⁵ four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand praised the Lord with\
      \ musical instruments, “which I made,” said David, “for giving praise.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Also David separated them into divisions among the sons of Levi: Gershon,\
      \ Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: '⁷ Of the Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei. '
    8: '⁸ The sons of Laadan: the first Jehiel, then Zetham and Joel—three in all. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were
      the heads of the fathers’ houses of Laadan. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were the
      four sons of Shimei. '
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the first and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not\
      \ have many sons; therefore they were assigned as one father’s house. \n"
    12: '¹² The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was set apart, he and his
      sons forever, that he should sanctify the most holy things, to burn incense
      before the Lord, to minister to Him, and to give the blessing in His name forever. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now the sons of Moses the man of God were reckoned to the tribe of Levi. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Moses were Gershon and Eliezer. '
    16: '¹⁶ Of the sons of Gershon, Shebuel was the first. '
    17: '¹⁷ Of the descendants of Eliezer, Rehabiah was the first. And Eliezer had
      no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. '
    18: '¹⁸ Of the sons of Izhar, Shelomith was the first. '
    19: '¹⁹ Of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel
      the third, and Jekameam the fourth. '
    20: "²⁰ Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah was the first and Jesshiah the second. \n"
    21: '²¹ The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar
      and Kish. '
    22: '²² And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but only daughters; and their brethren,
      the sons of Kish, took them as wives. '
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three in all. \n"
    24: "²⁴ These were the sons of Levi by their fathers’ houses—the heads of the\
      \ fathers’ houses as they were counted individually by the number of their names,\
      \ who did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from the age of\
      \ twenty years and above. \n"
    25: '²⁵ For David said, “The Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people,
      that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever”; '
    26: '²⁶ and also to the Levites, “They shall no longer carry the tabernacle, or
      any of the articles for its service.” '
    27: '²⁷ For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years
      old and above; '
    28: '²⁸ because their duty was to help the sons of Aaron in the service of the
      house of the Lord, in the courts and in the chambers, in the purifying of all
      holy things and the work of the service of the house of God, '
    29: '²⁹ both with the showbread and the fine flour for the grain offering, with
      the unleavened cakes and what is baked in the pan, with what is mixed and with
      all kinds of measures and sizes; '
    30: '³⁰ to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and likewise at evening; '
    31: '³¹ and at every presentation of a burnt offering to the Lord on the Sabbaths
      and on the New Moons and on the set feasts, by number according to the ordinance
      governing them, regularly before the Lord; '
    32: ³² and that they should attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting,
      the needs of the holy place, and the needs of the sons of Aaron their brethren
      in the work of the house of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were
      Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    2: '² And Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore
      Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests. '
    3: "³ Then David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons\
      \ of Ithamar, divided them according to the schedule of their service. \n"
    4: '⁴ There were more leaders found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of
      Ithamar, and thus they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen
      heads of their fathers’ houses, and eight heads of their fathers’ houses among
      the sons of Ithamar. '
    5: '⁵ Thus they were divided by lot, one group as another, for there were officials
      of the sanctuary and officials of the house of God, from the sons of Eleazar
      and from the sons of Ithamar. '
    6: "⁶ And the scribe, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, one of the Levites, wrote\
      \ them down before the king, the leaders, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son\
      \ of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Levites,\
      \ one father’s house taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now the first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, '
    8: '⁸ the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, '
    9: '⁹ the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, '
    10: '¹⁰ the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, '
    11: '¹¹ the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, '
    12: '¹² the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, '
    13: '¹³ the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, '
    14: '¹⁴ the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, '
    15: '¹⁵ the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, '
    16: '¹⁶ the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, '
    17: '¹⁷ the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, '
    18: "¹⁸ the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ This was the schedule of their service for coming into the house of the\
      \ Lord according to their ordinance by the hand of Aaron their father, as the\
      \ Lord God of Israel had commanded him. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the
      sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. '
    21: '²¹ Concerning Rehabiah, of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah. '
    22: '²² Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. '
    23: '²³ Of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel
      the third, and Jekameam the fourth. '
    24: '²⁴ Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah; of the sons of Michah, Shamir. '
    25: '²⁵ The brother of Michah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. '
    26: '²⁶ The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; the son of Jaaziah, Beno. '
    27: '²⁷ The sons of Merari by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. '
    28: '²⁸ Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. '
    29: "²⁹ Of Kish: the son of Kish, Jerahmeel. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Also the sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the\
      \ sons of the Levites according to their fathers’ houses. \n"
    31: ³¹ These also cast lots just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did, in the
      presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses
      of the priests and Levites. The chief fathers did just as their younger brethren.
  25:
    1: '¹ Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some
      of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps,
      stringed instruments, and cymbals. And the number of the skilled men performing
      their service was: '
    2: '² Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons
      of Asaph were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied according to the
      order of the king. '
    3: '³ Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah,
      and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied
      with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth,
      Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi,
      Hothir, and Mahazioth. '
    5: "⁵ All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to\
      \ exalt his horn. For God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. \n"
    6: '⁶ All these were under the direction of their father for the music in the
      house of the Lord, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service
      of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the authority of
      the king. '
    7: "⁷ So the number of them, with their brethren who were instructed in the songs\
      \ of the Lord, all who were skillful, was two hundred and eighty-eight. \n"
    8: "⁸ And they cast lots for their duty, the small as well as the great, the teacher\
      \ with the student. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now the first lot for Asaph came out for Joseph; the second for Gedaliah,
      him with his brethren and sons, twelve; '
    10: '¹⁰ the third for Zaccur, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    11: '¹¹ the fourth for Jizri, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    12: '¹² the fifth for Nethaniah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '

    17: '¹⁷ the tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    18: '¹⁸ the eleventh for Azarel, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    19: '¹⁹ the twelfth for Hashabiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    20: '²⁰ the thirteenth for Shubael, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    21: '²¹ the fourteenth for Mattithiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    22: '²² the fifteenth for Jeremoth, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    23: '²³ the sixteenth for Hananiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    24: '²⁴ the seventeenth for Joshbekashah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    25: '²⁵ the eighteenth for Hanani, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    26: '²⁶ the nineteenth for Mallothi, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    27: '²⁷ the twentieth for Eliathah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    28: '²⁸ the twenty-first for Hothir, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    29: '²⁹ the twenty-second for Giddalti, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    30: '³⁰ the twenty-third for Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren, twelve; '
    31: ³¹ the twenty-fourth for Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brethren, twelve.
  26:
    1: '¹ Concerning the divisions of the gatekeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah
      the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. '
    2: '² And the sons of Meshelemiah were Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second,
      Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, '
    3: "³ Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moreover the sons of Obed-Edom were Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the
      second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, '
    5: "⁵ Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God blessed\
      \ him. \n"
    6: '⁶ Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born who governed their fathers’ houses,
      because they were men of great ability. '
    7: "⁷ The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers\
      \ Elihu and Semachiah were able men. \n"
    8: "⁸ All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren,\
      \ able men with strength for the work: sixty-two of Obed-Edom. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, eighteen able men. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the first (for
      though he was not the firstborn, his father made him the first), '
    11: "¹¹ Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the\
      \ sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen. \n"
    12: '¹² Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, among the chief men,
      having duties just like their brethren, to serve in the house of the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ And they cast lots for each gate, the small as well as the great, according
      to their father’s house. '
    14: '¹⁴ The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his
      son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and his lot came out for the North Gate; '
    15: '¹⁵ to Obed-Edom the South Gate, and to his sons the storehouse. '
    16: '¹⁶ To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came out for the West Gate, with the Shallecheth
      Gate on the ascending highway—watchman opposite watchman. '
    17: '¹⁷ On the east were six Levites, on the north four each day, on the south
      four each day, and for the storehouse two by two. '
    18: '¹⁸ As for the Parbar on the west, there were four on the highway and two
      at the Parbar. '
    19: "¹⁹ These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah and\
      \ among the sons of Merari. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and

    21: '²¹ The sons of Laadan, the descendants of the Gershonites of Laadan, heads

    22: '²² The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel his brother, were over the treasuries

    26: '²⁶ This Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated
      things which King David and the heads of fathers’ houses, the captains over
      thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. '
    27: '²⁷ Some of the spoils won in battles they dedicated to maintain the house
      of the Lord. '
    28: "²⁸ And all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner,\

    29: "²⁹ Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons performed duties as officials\

    30: '³⁰ Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, one thousand seven hundred
      able men, had the oversight of Israel on the west side of the Jordan for all
      the business of the Lord, and in the service of the king. '
    31: '³¹ Among the Hebronites, Jerijah was head of the Hebronites according to
      his genealogy of the fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
      were sought, and there were found among them capable men at Jazer of Gilead. '
    32: ³² And his brethren were two thousand seven hundred able men, heads of fathers’
      houses, whom King David made officials over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and
      the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and the affairs

    5: '⁵ The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of
      Jehoiada the priest, who was chief; in his division were twenty-four thousand. '
    6: '⁶ This was the Benaiah who was mighty among the thirty, and was over the thirty;

    23: '²³ But David did not take the number of those twenty years old and under,
      because the Lord had said He would multiply Israel like the stars of the heavens. '
    24: "²⁴ Joab the son of Zeruiah began a census, but he did not finish, for wrath\
      \ came upon Israel because of this census; nor was the number recorded in the\
      \ account of the chronicles of King David. \n"
    25: '²⁵ And Azmaveth the son of Adiel was over the king’s treasuries; and Jehonathan
      the son of Uzziah was over the storehouses in the field, in the cities, in the
      villages, and in the fortresses. '
    26: '²⁶ Ezri the son of Chelub was over those who did the work of the field for
      tilling the ground. '
    27: '²⁷ And Shimei the Ramathite was over the vineyards, and Zabdi the Shiphmite
      was over the produce of the vineyards for the supply of wine. '
    28: '²⁸ Baal-Hanan the Gederite was over the olive trees and the sycamore trees

    33: '³³ Ahithophel was the king’s counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s
      companion. '
    34: ³⁴ After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, then Abiathar. And the
      general of the king’s army was Joab.
  28:
    1: "¹ Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the leaders of Israel: the officers\
      \ of the tribes and the captains of the divisions who served the king, the captains\
      \ over thousands and captains over hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance\
      \ and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officials, the valiant\
      \ men, and all the mighty men of valor. \n"
    2: '² Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Hear me, my brethren and my
      people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to
      build it. '
    3: '³ But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you
      have been a man of war and have shed blood.’ '
    4: '⁴ However the Lord God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father
      to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah to be the ruler. And
      of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father,
      He was pleased with me to make me king over all Israel. '
    5: '⁵ And of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons) He has chosen my
      son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. '
    6: '⁶ Now He said to me, ‘It is your son Solomon who shall build My house and
      My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father. '
    7: '⁷ Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is steadfast to observe
      My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.’ '
    8: "⁸ Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and\
      \ in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of\
      \ the Lord your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an\
      \ inheritance for your children after you forever. \n"
    9: '⁹ “As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him
      with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts
      and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be
      found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary;\
      \ be strong, and do it.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the vestibule, its houses,
      its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the
      mercy seat; '
    12: '¹² and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the
      house of the Lord, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the
      house of God, and of the treasuries for the dedicated things; '
    13: '¹³ also for the division of the priests and the Levites, for all the work
      of the service of the house of the Lord, and for all the articles of service
      in the house of the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ He gave gold by weight for things of gold, for all articles used in every
      kind of service; also silver for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles
      used in every kind of service; '
    15: '¹⁵ the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight
      for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for
      the lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand. '
    16: '¹⁶ And by weight he gave gold for the tables of the showbread, for each table,
      and silver for the tables of silver; '
    17: '¹⁷ also pure gold for the forks, the basins, the pitchers of pure gold, and
      the golden bowls—he gave gold by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls,
      silver by weight for every bowl; '
    18: '¹⁸ and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction
      of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed
      the ark of the covenant of the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ “All this,” said David, “the Lord made me understand in writing, by His\
      \ hand upon me, all the works of these plans.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ And David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and of good courage, and
      do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the Lord God—my God—will be with you.
      He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work
      for the service of the house of the Lord. '
    21: ²¹ Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service
      of the house of God; and every willing craftsman will be with you for all manner
      of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the leaders and all the people
      will be completely at your command.”
  29:
    1: '¹ Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: “My son Solomon, whom alone
      God has chosen, is young and inexperienced; and the work is great, because the
      temple is not for man but for the Lord God. '
    2: '² Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for
      things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of
      bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones
      to be set, glistening stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones,
      and marble slabs in abundance. '
    3: '³ Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have
      given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the
      holy house, my own special treasure of gold and silver: '
    4: '⁴ three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand
      talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; '
    5: "⁵ the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for\
      \ all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing\
      \ to consecrate himself this day to the Lord?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the leaders of the fathers’ houses, leaders of the tribes of Israel,
      the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king’s
      work, offered willingly. '
    7: '⁷ They gave for the work of the house of God five thousand talents and ten
      thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents
      of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. '
    8: '⁸ And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of
      the Lord, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. '
    9: "⁹ Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a\
      \ loyal heart they had offered willingly to the Lord; and King David also rejoiced\
      \ greatly. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore David blessed the Lord before all the assembly; and David said:\n\
      “Blessed are You, Lord God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Yours, O Lord, is the greatness,\nThe power and the glory,\nThe victory\
      \ and the majesty;\nFor all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours;\nYours\
      \ is the kingdom, O Lord,\nAnd You are exalted as head over all.\n"
    12: "¹² Both riches and honor come from You,\nAnd You reign over all.\nIn Your\
      \ hand is power and might;\nIn Your hand it is to make great\nAnd to give strength\
      \ to all. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Now therefore, our God,\nWe thank You\nAnd praise Your glorious name.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But who am I, and who are my people,\nThat we should be able to offer\
      \ so willingly as this?\nFor all things come from You,\nAnd of Your own we have\
      \ given You.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For we are aliens and pilgrims before You,\nAs were all our fathers;\n\
      Our days on earth are as a shadow,\nAnd without hope. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You
      a house for Your holy name is from Your hand, and is all Your own. '
    17: '¹⁷ I know also, my God, that You test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness.
      As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these
      things; and now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to offer
      willingly to You. '
    18: '¹⁸ O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever
      in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart
      toward You. '
    19: "¹⁹ And give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your\
      \ testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple\
      \ for which I have made provision.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the Lord your God.” So\
      \ all the assembly blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed their heads\
      \ and prostrated themselves before the Lord and the king. \n"
    21: '²¹ And they made sacrifices to the Lord and offered burnt offerings to the
      Lord on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with
      their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. '
    22: '²² So they ate and drank before the Lord with great gladness on that day.
      And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him
      before the Lord to be the leader, and Zadok to be priest. '
    23: '²³ Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his
      father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: '²⁴ All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David,
      submitted themselves to King Solomon. '
    25: "²⁵ So the Lord exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and\
      \ bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him\
      \ in Israel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. '
    27: '²⁷ And the period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years
      he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem. '
    28: '²⁸ So he died in a good old age, full of days and riches and honor; and Solomon
      his son reigned in his place. '
    29: '²⁹ Now the acts of King David, first and last, indeed they are written in
      the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book
      of Gad the seer, '
    30: ³⁰ with all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him,
      to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.
