2 Chronicles:
  1:
    1: "¹ Now Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord\
      \ his God was with him and exalted him exceedingly. \n"
    2: '² And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
      to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’
      houses. '
    3: '³ Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that
      was at Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses
      the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness. '
    4: '⁴ But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place
      David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. '
    5: '⁵ Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made,
      he put before the tabernacle of the Lord; Solomon and the assembly sought Him
      there. '
    6: "⁶ And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the Lord, which was\
      \ at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask! What shall\
      \ I give you?” \n"
    8: '⁸ And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to David my father,
      and have made me king in his place. '
    9: '⁹ Now, O Lord God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for
      You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. '
    10: "¹⁰ Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before\
      \ this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have
      not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you
      asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may
      judge My people over whom I have made you king— '
    12: "¹² wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and\
      \ wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who were before you,\
      \ nor shall any after you have the like.” \n"
    13: '¹³ So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from
      before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel. '
    14: '¹⁴ And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred
      chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities
      and with the king in Jerusalem. '
    15: '¹⁵ Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and
      he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland. '
    16: '¹⁶ And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants
      bought them in Keveh at the current price. '
    17: ¹⁷ They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels
      of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, through their agents,
      they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
  2:
    1: '¹ Then Solomon determined to build a temple for the name of the Lord, and
      a royal house for himself. '
    2: "² Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to\
      \ quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying:\nAs you have dealt with\
      \ David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in,\
      \ so deal with me. "
    4: "⁴ Behold, I am building a temple for the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate\
      \ it to Him, to burn before Him sweet incense, for the continual showbread,\
      \ for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the New Moons,\
      \ and on the set feasts of the Lord our God. This is an ordinance forever to\
      \ Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ And the temple which I build will be great, for our God is greater than
      all gods. '
    6: "⁶ But who is able to build Him a temple, since heaven and the heaven of heavens\
      \ cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a temple, except\
      \ to burn sacrifice before Him? \n"
    7: '⁷ Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver, in
      bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and blue, who has skill to engrave with
      the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father
      provided. '
    8: '⁸ Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that
      your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants will
      be with your servants, '
    9: "⁹ to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the temple which I am about to\
      \ build shall be great and wonderful. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber,\
      \ twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty\
      \ thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon:\n\
      Because the Lord loves His people, He has made you king over them. \n"
    12: "¹² Hiram also said:\nBlessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and\
      \ earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding,\
      \ who will build a temple for the Lord and a royal house for himself! \n"
    13: '¹³ And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram
      my master craftsman '
    14: "¹⁴ (the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man\
      \ of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood,\
      \ purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to\
      \ accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and\
      \ with the skillful men of my lord David your father. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord
      has spoken of, let him send to his servants. '
    16: "¹⁶ And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring\
      \ it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after
      the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found
      to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. '
    18: ¹⁸ And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand
      stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make
      the people work.
  3:
    1: '¹ Now Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah,
      where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had
      prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    2: "² And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth\
      \ year of his reign. \n"
    3: '³ This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God:
      The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and
      the width twenty cubits. '
    4: '⁴ And the vestibule that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long
      across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He
      overlaid the inside with pure gold. '
    5: '⁵ The larger room he paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold,
      and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it. '
    6: '⁶ And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold
      was gold from Parvaim. '
    7: "⁷ He also overlaid the house—the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors—with\
      \ gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls. \n"
    8: '⁸ And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length was according to the width of
      the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six
      hundred talents of fine gold. '
    9: '⁹ The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he overlaid the upper
      area with gold. '
    10: '¹⁰ In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and
      overlaid them with gold. '
    11: '¹¹ The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in overall length: one wing
      of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other
      wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub; '
    12: '¹² one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the
      room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other
      cherub. '
    13: '¹³ The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall. They stood
      on their feet, and they faced inward. '
    14: "¹⁴ And he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and wove\
      \ cherubim into it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Also he made in front of the temple two pillars thirty-five cubits high,
      and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. '
    16: '¹⁶ He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them
      on top of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on
      the wreaths of chainwork. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and
      the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin,
      and the name of the one on the left Boaz.
  4:
    1: "¹ Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits\
      \ its width, and ten cubits its height. \n"
    2: '² Then he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other;
      it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits
      measured its circumference. '
    3: '³ And under it was the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a
      cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was
      cast. '
    4: '⁴ It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward
      the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east;
      the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward. '
    5: "⁵ It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup,\
      \ like a lily blossom. It contained three thousand baths. \n"
    6: '⁶ He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the
      left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they
      would wash in them, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in. '
    7: '⁷ And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set them
      in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. '
    8: "⁸ He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right\
      \ side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold. \n"
    9: '⁹ Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors
      for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze. '
    10: "¹⁰ He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished
      doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God: '
    12: '¹² the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two
      pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on
      top of the pillars; '
    13: '¹³ four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates
      for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the pillars); '
    14: '¹⁴ he also made carts and the lavers on the carts; '
    15: '¹⁵ one Sea and twelve oxen under it; '
    16: "¹⁶ also the pots, the shovels, the forks—and all their articles Huram his\
      \ master craftsman made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth
      and Zeredah. '
    18: "¹⁸ And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the\
      \ weight of the bronze was not determined. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar
      of gold and the tables on which was the showbread; '
    20: '²⁰ the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in the prescribed
      manner in front of the inner sanctuary, '
    21: '²¹ with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold, of purest
      gold; '
    22: ²² the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold. As for
      the entry of the sanctuary, its inner doors to the Most Holy Place, and the
      doors of the main hall of the temple, were gold.
  5:
    1: "¹ So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the Lord was finished;\
      \ and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the\
      \ silver and the gold and all the furnishings. And he put them in the treasuries\
      \ of the house of God. \n"
    2: '² Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes,
      the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring
      the ark of the covenant of the Lord up from the City of David, which is Zion. '
    3: '³ Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king at the feast, which
      was in the seventh month. '
    4: '⁴ So all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. '
    5: '⁵ Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy
      furnishings that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought
      them up. '
    6: '⁶ Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled
      with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted
      or numbered for multitude. '
    7: '⁷ Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place,
      into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings
      of the cherubim. '
    8: '⁸ For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim
      overshadowed the ark and its poles. '
    9: '⁹ The poles extended so that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen
      from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be
      seen from outside. And they are there to this day. '
    10: "¹⁰ Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at\
      \ Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they\
      \ had come out of Egypt. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And it came to pass when the priests came out of the Most Holy Place (for
      all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without keeping
      to their divisions), '
    12: '¹² and the Levites who were the singers, all those of Asaph and Heman and
      Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, stood at the east end of the altar,
      clothed in white linen, having cymbals, stringed instruments and harps, and
      with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets— '
    13: "¹³ indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to\
      \ make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord, and when they\
      \ lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music,\
      \ and praised the Lord, saying:\n“For He is good,\nFor His mercy endures forever,”\n\
      that the house, the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud, "
    14: ¹⁴ so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud;
      for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Solomon spoke:\n“The Lord said He would dwell in the dark cloud.\n"
    2: "² I have surely built You an exalted house,\nAnd a place for You to dwell\
      \ in forever.” \n"
    3: '³ Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while
      all the assembly of Israel was standing. '
    4: '⁴ And he said: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who has fulfilled with
      His hands what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying, '
    5: '⁵ ‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have
      chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name
      might be there, nor did I choose any man to be a ruler over My people Israel. '
    6: '⁶ Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there, and I have chosen
      David to be over My people Israel.’ '
    7: '⁷ Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name
      of the Lord God of Israel. '
    8: '⁸ But the Lord said to my father David, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build
      a temple for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart. '
    9: '⁹ Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come
      from your body, he shall build the temple for My name.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ So the Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke, and I have filled the
      position of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised;
      and I have built the temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ And there I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord which\
      \ He made with the children of Israel.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all
      the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands '
    13: '¹³ (for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits
      wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he
      stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and
      spread out his hands toward heaven); '
    14: '¹⁴ and he said: “Lord God of Israel, there is no God in heaven or on earth
      like You, who keep Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before
      You with all their hearts. '
    15: '¹⁵ You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have
      both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore, Lord God of Israel, now keep what You promised Your servant
      David my father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man sit before Me on
      the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, that they walk
      in My law as you have walked before Me.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ And now, O Lord God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have\
      \ spoken to Your servant David. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the
      heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have
      built! '
    19: '¹⁹ Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord my
      God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before
      You: '
    20: '²⁰ that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night, toward the
      place where You said You would put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which
      Your servant makes toward this place. '
    21: "²¹ And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people\
      \ Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven Your dwelling place,\
      \ and when You hear, forgive. \n"
    22: '²² “If anyone sins against his neighbor, and is forced to take an oath, and
      comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this temple, '
    23: "²³ then hear from heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, bringing retribution\
      \ on the wicked by bringing his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous\
      \ by giving him according to his righteousness. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Or if Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have
      sinned against You, and return and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication
      before You in this temple, '
    25: "²⁵ then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring\
      \ them back to the land which You gave to them and their fathers. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned
      against You, when they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn
      from their sin because You afflict them, '
    27: "²⁷ then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people\
      \ Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and\
      \ send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts
      or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities;
      whatever plague or whatever sickness there is; '
    29: '²⁹ whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your
      people Israel, when each one knows his own burden and his own grief, and spreads
      out his hands to this temple: '
    30: '³⁰ then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone
      according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone know the hearts
      of the sons of men), '
    31: "³¹ that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the\
      \ land which You gave to our fathers. \n"
    32: '³² “Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but
      has come from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty
      hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray in this temple; '
    33: "³³ then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for\
      \ which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your\
      \ name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this\
      \ temple which I have built is called by Your name. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You
      send them, and when they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen
      and the temple which I have built for Your name, '
    35: "³⁵ then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain\
      \ their cause. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and
      You become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and they take them
      captive to a land far or near; '
    37: '³⁷ yet when they come to themselves in the land where they were carried captive,
      and repent, and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying,
      ‘We have sinned, we have done wrong, and have committed wickedness’; '
    38: '³⁸ and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul
      in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and pray
      toward their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen,
      and toward the temple which I have built for Your name: '
    39: '³⁹ then hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications,
      and maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and let Your ears be attentive\
      \ to the prayer made in this place. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Now therefore,\nArise, O Lord God, to Your resting place,\nYou and the\
      \ ark of Your strength.\nLet Your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation,\n\
      And let Your saints rejoice in goodness. \n"
    42: "⁴² “O Lord God, do not turn away the face of Your Anointed;\nRemember the\
      \ mercies of Your servant David.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed
      the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the
      temple. '
    2: '² And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory
      of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house. '
    3: "³ When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory\
      \ of the Lord on the temple, they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement,\
      \ and worshiped and praised the Lord, saying:\n“For He is good,\nFor His mercy\
      \ endures forever.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred
      and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house
      of God. '
    6: "⁶ And the priests attended to their services; the Levites also with instruments\
      \ of the music of the Lord, which King David had made to praise the Lord, saying,\
      \ “For His mercy endures forever,” whenever David offered praise by their ministry.\
      \ The priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel stood. \n"
    7: "⁷ Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front\
      \ of the house of the Lord; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat\
      \ of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was\
      \ not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him,
      a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for they observed the
      dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. '
    10: '¹⁰ On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to
      their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the Lord had done for
      David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king’s house; and\
      \ Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in\
      \ the house of the Lord and in his own house. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: “I have heard
      your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. '
    13: '¹³ When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to
      devour the land, or send pestilence among My people, '
    14: '¹⁴ if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray
      and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven,
      and will forgive their sin and heal their land. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this
      place. '
    16: '¹⁶ For now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that My name may be there
      forever; and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. '
    17: '¹⁷ As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do
      according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and
      My judgments, '
    18: "¹⁸ then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with\
      \ David your father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.’\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which
      I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them, '
    20: "²⁰ then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this\
      \ house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and\
      \ will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. \n"
    21: '²¹ “And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will
      be astonished and say, ‘Why has the Lord done thus to this land and this house?’ '
    22: ²² Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers,
      who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped
      them and served them; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them.’ ”
  8:
    1: '¹ It came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the house
      of the Lord and his own house, '
    2: '² that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and
      he settled the children of Israel there. '
    3: '³ And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. '
    4: '⁴ He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which
      he built in Hamath. '
    5: '⁵ He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls,
      gates, and bars, '
    6: "⁶ also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot\
      \ cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon desired to build\
      \ in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. \n"
    7: '⁷ All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites,
      and Jebusites, who were not of Israel— '
    8: '⁸ that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the
      children of Israel did not destroy—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as
      it is to this day. '
    9: '⁹ But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work. Some
      were men of war, captains of his officers, captains of his chariots, and his
      cavalry. '
    10: "¹⁰ And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and\
      \ fifty, who ruled over the people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David\
      \ to the house he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in\
      \ the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of\
      \ the Lord has come are holy.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord
      which he had built before the vestibule, '
    13: '¹³ according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of
      Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts—the
      Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. '
    14: '¹⁴ And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the divisions
      of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and
      serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers
      by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded. '
    15: "¹⁵ They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites\
      \ concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation\
      \ of the house of the Lord until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was\
      \ completed. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land
      of Edom. '
    18: ¹⁸ And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who
      knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired
      four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem
      to test Solomon with hard questions, having a very great retinue, camels that
      bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon,
      she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. '
    2: '² So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for
      Solomon that he could not explain it to her. '
    3: '³ And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that
      he had built, '
    4: "⁴ the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters\
      \ and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his entryway by which\
      \ he went up to the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own
      land about your words and your wisdom. '
    6: '⁶ However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes;
      and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed
      the fame of which I heard. '
    7: '⁷ Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually
      before you and hear your wisdom! '
    8: "⁸ Blessed be the Lord your God, who delighted in you, setting you on His throne\
      \ to be king for the Lord your God! Because your God has loved Israel, to establish\
      \ them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in\
      \ great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as\
      \ those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold
      from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones. '
    11: "¹¹ And the king made walkways of the algum wood for the house of the Lord\
      \ and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers;\
      \ and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah. \n"
    12: "¹² Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever\
      \ she asked, much more than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went\
      \ to her own country, she and her servants. \n"
    13: '¹³ The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six
      talents of gold, '
    14: '¹⁴ besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the
      kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. '
    15: '¹⁵ And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six
      hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield. '
    16: "¹⁶ He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels\
      \ of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest\
      \ of Lebanon. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure
      gold. '
    18: '¹⁸ The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened
      to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat,
      and two lions stood beside the armrests. '
    19: "¹⁹ Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like\
      \ this had been made for any other kingdom. \n"
    20: '²⁰ All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of
      the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this
      was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. '
    21: "²¹ For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once\
      \ every three years the merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes,\
      \ and monkeys. \n"
    22: '²² So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. '
    23: '²³ And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear
      his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. '
    24: "²⁴ Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor,\
      \ spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand\
      \ horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ So he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines,
      as far as the border of Egypt. '
    27: '²⁷ The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar
      trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland. '
    28: "²⁸ And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written
      in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite,
      and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? '
    30: '³⁰ Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. '
    31: ³¹ Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David
      his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
  10:
    1: '¹ And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make
      him king. '
    2: '² So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was in Egypt,
      where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned
      from Egypt. '
    3: '³ Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came
      and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, '
    4: "⁴ “Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome\
      \ service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will\
      \ serve you.” \n"
    5: "⁵ So he said to them, “Come back to me after three days.” And the people departed.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon\
      \ while he still lived, saying, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ And they spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, and please\
      \ them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.” \n"
    8: '⁸ But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted
      the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. '
    9: "⁹ And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this\
      \ people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father\
      \ put on us’?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus
      you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father
      made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us’—thus you shall say to them:
      ‘My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s waist! '
    11: "¹¹ And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your\
      \ yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’\
      \ ” \n"
    12: '¹² So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the
      king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.” '
    13: '¹³ Then the king answered them roughly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice
      of the elders, '
    14: '¹⁴ and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying,
      “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you
      with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!” '
    15: "¹⁵ So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from\
      \ God, that the Lord might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand\
      \ of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people\
      \ answered the king, saying:\n“What share have we in David?\nWe have no inheritance\
      \ in the son of Jesse.\nEvery man to your tents, O Israel!\nNow see to your\
      \ own house, O David!”\nSo all Israel departed to their tents. "
    17: "¹⁷ But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of revenue; but the
      children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam
      mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem. '
    19: ¹⁹ So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
  11:
    1: "¹ Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled from the house of Judah\
      \ and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors,\
      \ to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. \n"
    2: '² But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, '
    3: '³ “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel
      in Judah and Benjamin, saying, '
    4: "⁴ ‘Thus says the Lord: “You shall not go up or fight against your brethren!\
      \ Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.” ’ ” Therefore\
      \ they obeyed the words of the Lord, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. '
    6: '⁶ And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, '
    7: '⁷ Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam, '
    8: '⁸ Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, '
    9: '⁹ Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, '
    10: '¹⁰ Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified
      cities. '
    11: '¹¹ And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores
      of food, oil, and wine. '
    12: "¹² Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong,\
      \ having Judah and Benjamin on his side. \n"
    13: '¹³ And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in
      all Israel took their stand with him. '
    14: '¹⁴ For the Levites left their common-lands and their possessions and came
      to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving
      as priests to the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for the demons,
      and the calf idols which he had made. '
    16: '¹⁶ And after the Levites left, those from all the tribes of Israel, such
      as set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice
      to the Lord God of their fathers. '
    17: "¹⁷ So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of\
      \ Solomon strong for three years, because they walked in the way of David and\
      \ Solomon for three years. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth
      the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse. '
    19: '¹⁹ And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. '
    20: '²⁰ After her he took Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him
      Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. '
    21: '²¹ Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all
      his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines,
      and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. '
    22: '²² And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, to be leader
      among his brothers; for he intended to make him king. '
    23: ²³ He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories
      of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions
      in abundance. He also sought many wives for them.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened
      himself, that he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel along with him. '
    2: '² And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of
      Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord, '
    3: '³ with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without
      number who came with him out of Egypt—the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. '
    4: "⁴ And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who\
      \ were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them,\
      \ “Thus says the Lord: ‘You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left\
      \ you in the hand of Shishak.’ ” \n"
    6: "⁶ So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said,\
      \ “The Lord is righteous.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Now when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord
      came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not
      destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be
      poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. '
    8: "⁸ Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may distinguish My service\
      \ from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures
      of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything.
      He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them
      to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s
      house. '
    11: '¹¹ And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guard would go
      and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom. '
    12: "¹² When he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so as\
      \ not to destroy him completely; and things also went well in Judah. \n"
    13: '¹³ Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now
      Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen
      years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes
      of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. '
    14: "¹⁴ And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book
      of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there
      were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. '
    16: ¹⁶ So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David.
      Then Abijah his son reigned in his place.
  13:
    1: '¹ In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. '
    2: "² He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Michaiah the\
      \ daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.\nAnd there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. "
    3: "³ Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred\
      \ thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him\
      \ with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountains of Ephraim,
      and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: '
    5: '⁵ Should you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel
      to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt? '
    6: '⁶ Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David,
      rose up and rebelled against his lord. '
    7: '⁷ Then worthless rogues gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against
      Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and could
      not withstand them. '
    8: '⁸ And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord, which is in the
      hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the
      gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods. '
    9: '⁹ Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the
      Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so
      that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may
      be a priest of things that are not gods? '
    10: '¹⁰ But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and
      the priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites
      attend to their duties. '
    11: '¹¹ And they burn to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices
      and sweet incense; they also set the showbread in order on the pure gold table,
      and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we keep
      the command of the Lord our God, but you have forsaken Him. '
    12: "¹² Now look, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding\
      \ trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight\
      \ against the Lord God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper!” \n"
    13: '¹³ But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in
      front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them. '
    14: '¹⁴ And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line was at
      both front and rear; and they cried out to the Lord, and the priests sounded
      the trumpets. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it
      happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into
      their hand. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five
      hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain. '
    18: "¹⁸ Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children\
      \ of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the Lord God of their fathers.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its
      villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephrain with its villages. '
    20: "²⁰ So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and\
      \ the Lord struck him, and he died. \n"
    21: '²¹ But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons
      and sixteen daughters. '
    22: ²² Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written
      in the annals of the prophet Iddo.
  14:
    1: "¹ So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David.\
      \ Then Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for\
      \ ten years. \n"
    2: '² Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God, '
    3: '³ for he removed the altars of the foreign gods and the high places, and broke
      down the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images. '
    4: '⁴ He commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to observe
      the law and the commandment. '
    5: '⁵ He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities
      of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him. '
    6: '⁶ And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no
      war in those years, because the Lord had given him rest. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and make walls around
      them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because
      we have sought the Lord our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest
      on every side.” So they built and prospered. '
    8: "⁸ And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields\
      \ and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried\
      \ shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million
      men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. '
    10: '¹⁰ So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in
      the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. '
    11: "¹¹ And Asa cried out to the Lord his God, and said, “Lord, it is nothing\
      \ for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us,\
      \ O Lord our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude.\
      \ O Lord, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You!” \n"
    12: '¹² So the Lord struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians
      fled. '
    13: '¹³ And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the
      Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken
      before the Lord and His army. And they carried away very much spoil. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the Lord
      came upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly
      much spoil in them. '
    15: ¹⁵ They also attacked the livestock enclosures, and carried off sheep and
      camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
  15:
    1: '¹ Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded. '
    2: '² And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah
      and Benjamin. The Lord is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him,
      He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. '
    3: '³ For a long time Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching
      priest, and without law; '
    4: '⁴ but when in their trouble they turned to the Lord God of Israel, and sought
      Him, He was found by them. '
    5: '⁵ And in those times there was no peace to the one who went out, nor to the
      one who came in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands. '
    6: '⁶ So nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them
      with every adversity. '
    7: "⁷ But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall\
      \ be rewarded!” \n"
    8: '⁸ And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he
      took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and
      Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim;
      and he restored the altar of the Lord that was before the vestibule of the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who dwelt with them from\
      \ Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers\
      \ from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth
      year of the reign of Asa. '
    11: '¹¹ And they offered to the Lord at that time seven hundred bulls and seven
      thousand sheep from the spoil they had brought. '
    12: '¹² Then they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers
      with all their heart and with all their soul; '
    13: '¹³ and whoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel was to be put to death,
      whether small or great, whether man or woman. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then they took an oath before the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting
      and trumpets and rams’ horns. '
    15: "¹⁵ And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their\
      \ heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the\
      \ Lord gave them rest all around. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Also he removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen
      mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut down her
      obscene image, then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron. '
    17: "¹⁷ But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart\
      \ of Asa was loyal all his days. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated
      and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils. '
    19: ¹⁹ And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
  16:
    1: '¹ In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came
      up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to
      Asa king of Judah. '
    2: '² Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the
      Lord and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt
      in Damascus, saying, '
    3: "³ “Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father\
      \ and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty\
      \ with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against
      the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage
      cities of Naphtali. '
    5: '⁵ Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and
      ceased his work. '
    6: "⁶ Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber\
      \ of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba\
      \ and Mizpah. \n"
    7: '⁷ And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to
      him: “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the
      Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your
      hand. '
    8: '⁸ Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots
      and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the Lord, He delivered them into your
      hand. '
    9: '⁹ For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show
      Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have
      done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged\
      \ at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book
      of the kings of Judah and Israel. '
    12: "¹² And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his\
      \ feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord,\
      \ but the physicians. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his
      reign. '
    14: ¹⁴ They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City
      of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various
      ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made a very great burning
      for him.
  17:
    1: '¹ Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself
      against Israel. '
    2: '² And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons
      in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken. '
    3: '³ Now the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways
      of his father David; he did not seek the Baals, '
    4: '⁴ but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not
      according to the acts of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave
      presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. '
    6: "⁶ And his heart took delight in the ways of the Lord; moreover he removed\
      \ the high places and wooden images from Judah. \n"
    7: '⁷ Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah,
      Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. '
    8: '⁸ And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth,
      Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah—the Levites; and with them Elishama
      and Jehoram, the priests. '
    9: "⁹ So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of the Lord with them;\
      \ they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And the fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were
      around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. '
    11: "¹¹ Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as\
      \ tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred\
      \ rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats. \n"
    12: '¹² So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and
      storage cities in Judah. '
    13: "¹³ He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty\
      \ men of valor, were in Jerusalem. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ These are their numbers, according to their fathers’ houses. Of Judah,
      the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand
      mighty men of valor; '
    15: '¹⁵ and next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and
      eighty thousand; '
    16: '¹⁶ and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself
      to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. '
    17: '¹⁷ Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand
      men armed with bow and shield; '
    18: '¹⁸ and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand
      prepared for war. '
    19: ¹⁹ These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities
      throughout all Judah.
  18:
    1: '¹ Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and by marriage he allied
      himself with Ahab. '
    2: '² After some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed
      sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him, and persuaded
      him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead. '
    3: "³ So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with\
      \ me against Ramoth Gilead?”\nAnd he answered him, “I am as you are, and my\
      \ people as your people; we will be with you in the war.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word\
      \ of the Lord today.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men,\
      \ and said to them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”\n\
      So they said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.” \n"
    6: "⁶ But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not still a prophet of the Lord here, that\
      \ we may inquire of Him?” \n"
    7: "⁷ So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom\
      \ we may inquire of the Lord; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good\
      \ concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.”\nAnd Jehoshaphat\
      \ said, “Let not the king say such things!” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the king of Israel called one of his officers and said, “Bring Micaiah\
      \ the son of Imla quickly!” \n"
    9: '⁹ The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes,
      sat each on his throne; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of
      the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. '
    10: "¹⁰ Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself;\
      \ and he said, “Thus says the Lord: ‘With these you shall gore the Syrians until\
      \ they are destroyed.’ ” \n"
    11: "¹¹ And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and\
      \ prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king’s hand.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying,\
      \ “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king.\
      \ Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak\
      \ encouragement.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And Micaiah said, “As the Lord lives, whatever my God says, that I will\
      \ speak.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we\
      \ go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”\nAnd he said, “Go and\
      \ prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you\
      \ tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that\
      \ have no shepherd. And the Lord said, ‘These have no master. Let each return\
      \ to his house in peace.’ ” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would\
      \ not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord
      sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand
      and His left. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the Lord said, ‘Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that
      he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke
      in that manner. '
    20: '²⁰ Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, and said, ‘I will
      persuade him.’ The Lord said to him, ‘In what way?’ '
    21: '²¹ So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
      prophets.’ And the Lord said, ‘You shall persuade him and also prevail; go out
      and do so.’ '
    22: "²² Therefore look! The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these\
      \ prophets of yours, and the Lord has declared disaster against you.” \n"
    23: "²³ Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the\
      \ cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the Lord go from me to speak\
      \ to you?” \n"
    24: "²⁴ And Micaiah said, “Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an\
      \ inner chamber to hide!” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the
      governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; '
    26: "²⁶ and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this fellow in prison, and feed him\
      \ with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I return in peace.”\
      \ ’ ” \n"
    27: "²⁷ But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the Lord has not spoken\
      \ by me.” And he said, “Take heed, all you people!” \n"
    28: '²⁸ So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth
      Gilead. '
    29: "²⁹ And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and\
      \ go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised\
      \ himself, and they went into battle. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were\
      \ with him, saying, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king\
      \ of Israel.” \n"
    31: '³¹ So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they
      said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they surrounded him to attack; but
      Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him, and God diverted them from him. '
    32: '³² For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the
      king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. '
    33: '³³ Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel
      between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn
      around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” '
    34: ³⁴ The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up
      in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset
      he died.
  19:
    1: '¹ Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King
      Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Therefore
      the wrath of the Lord is upon you. '
    3: "³ Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the\
      \ wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people
      from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord
      God of their fathers. '
    5: '⁵ Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah,
      city by city, '
    6: '⁶ and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not
      judge for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment. '
    7: "⁷ Now therefore, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care and do it,\
      \ for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, no partiality, nor taking\
      \ of bribes.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the Lord and for controversies,
      Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the chief
      fathers of Israel, when they returned to Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you shall act in the fear of the Lord,
      faithfully and with a loyal heart: '
    10: '¹⁰ Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities,
      whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes
      or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the Lord and
      wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you will not be guilty. '
    11: '¹¹ And take notice: Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of
      the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah,
      for all the king’s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Behave
      courageously, and the Lord will be with the good.”'
  20:
    1: '¹ It happened after this that the people of Moab with the people of Ammon,
      and others with them besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat. '
    2: '² Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming
      against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar”
      (which is En Gedi). '
    3: '³ And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed
      a fast throughout all Judah. '
    4: "⁴ So Judah gathered together to ask help from the Lord; and from all the cities\
      \ of Judah they came to seek the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house
      of the Lord, before the new court, '
    6: '⁶ and said: “O Lord God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven, and do
      You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there
      not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You? '
    7: '⁷ Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your
      people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? '
    8: '⁸ And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name,
      saying, '
    9: '⁹ ‘If disaster comes upon us—sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will
      stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your name is in this temple),
      and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—whom You would
      not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned
      from them and did not destroy them— '
    11: '¹¹ here they are, rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession
      which You have given us to inherit. '
    12: "¹² O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this\
      \ great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but\
      \ our eyes are upon You.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children,\
      \ stood before the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the
      son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
      of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. '
    15: '¹⁵ And he said, “Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem,
      and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: ‘Do not be afraid nor
      dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s. '
    16: '¹⁶ Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent
      of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness
      of Jeruel. '
    17: "¹⁷ You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand\
      \ still and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!’\
      \ Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is\
      \ with you.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children\
      \ of the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with voices loud\
      \ and high. \n"
    20: '²⁰ So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of
      Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and
      you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be
      established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.” '
    21: "²¹ And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should\
      \ sing to the Lord, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went\
      \ out before the army and were saying:\n“Praise the Lord,\nFor His mercy endures\
      \ forever.” \n"
    22: '²² Now when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushes against
      the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they
      were defeated. '
    23: "²³ For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount\
      \ Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the\
      \ inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. \n"
    24: "²⁴ So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked\
      \ toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth.\
      \ No one had escaped. \n"
    25: '²⁵ When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found
      among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry,
      which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and
      they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. '
    26: '²⁶ And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there
      they blessed the Lord; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley
      of Berachah until this day. '
    27: '²⁷ Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat
      in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the Lord had made them
      rejoice over their enemies. '
    28: '²⁸ So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets,
      to the house of the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they
      heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. '
    30: "³⁰ Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all\
      \ around. \n"
    31: '³¹ So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when
      he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s
      name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. '
    32: '³² And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from
      it, doing what was right in the sight of the Lord. '
    33: "³³ Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people\
      \ had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they are\
      \ written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book\
      \ of the kings of Israel. \n"
    35: '³⁵ After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king
      of Israel, who acted very wickedly. '
    36: '³⁶ And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they
      made the ships in Ezion Geber. '
    37: ³⁷ But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
      saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the Lord has destroyed
      your works.” Then the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to
      Tarshish.
  21:
    1: '¹ And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
      in the City of David. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place. '
    2: '² He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu,
      Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. '
    3: "³ Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things,\
      \ with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because\
      \ he was the firstborn. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened\
      \ himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the\
      \ princes of Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight
      years in Jerusalem. '
    6: '⁶ And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab
      had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the
      sight of the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ Yet the Lord would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant\
      \ that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him\
      \ and to his sons forever. \n"
    8: '⁸ In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over
      themselves. '
    9: '⁹ So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And
      he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains
      of the chariots. '
    10: '¹⁰ Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. At
      that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the Lord
      God of his fathers. '
    11: "¹¹ Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the\
      \ inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray. \n"
    12: "¹² And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,\nThus says the\
      \ Lord God of your father David:\nBecause you have not walked in the ways of\
      \ Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, "
    13: '¹³ but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the
      house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father’s household,
      who were better than yourself, '
    14: '¹⁴ behold, the Lord will strike your people with a serious affliction—your
      children, your wives, and all your possessions; '
    15: "¹⁵ and you will become very sick with a disease of your intestines, until\
      \ your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines
      and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians. '
    17: "¹⁷ And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions\
      \ that were found in the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that\
      \ there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ After all this the Lord struck him in his intestines with an incurable
      disease. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that\
      \ his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain.\
      \ And his people made no burning for him, like the burning for his fathers.\
      \ \n"
    20: ²⁰ He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem
      eight years and, to no one’s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the
      City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in
      his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed
      all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned. '
    2: '² Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one
      year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri. '
    3: '³ He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised
      him to do wickedly. '
    4: '⁴ Therefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab;
      for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction. '
    5: '⁵ He also followed their advice, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king
      of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians
      wounded Joram. '
    6: "⁶ Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received\
      \ at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son\
      \ of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel,\
      \ because he was sick. \n"
    7: '⁷ His going to Joram was God’s occasion for Ahaziah’s downfall; for when he
      arrived, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord
      had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. '
    8: '⁸ And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab,
      and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served
      Ahaziah, that he killed them. '
    9: "⁹ Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria),\
      \ and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, “because,”\
      \ they said, “he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his\
      \ heart.”\nSo the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
      arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah. '
    11: '¹¹ But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah,
      and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered, and put
      him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram,
      the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him
      from Athaliah so that she did not kill him. '
    12: ¹² And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah
      reigned over the land.
  23:
    1: '¹ In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with
      the captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan,
      Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son
      of Zichri. '
    2: "² And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities\
      \ of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. \n"
    3: '³ Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
      And he said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the Lord has said
      of the sons of David. '
    4: '⁴ This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of
      the priests and the Levites, shall be keeping watch over the doors; '
    5: '⁵ one-third shall be at the king’s house; and one-third at the Gate of the
      Foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ But let no one come into the house of the Lord except the priests and those
      of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people
      shall keep the watch of the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his\
      \ weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death.\
      \ You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest
      commanded. And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath,
      with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had
      not dismissed the divisions. '
    9: '⁹ And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and
      the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the
      temple of God. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from
      the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar
      and by the temple, all around the king. '
    11: "¹¹ And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the\
      \ Testimony, and made him king. Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and\
      \ said, “Long live the king!” \n"
    12: '¹² Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the
      king, she came to the people in the temple of the Lord. '
    13: "¹³ When she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance;\
      \ and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the\
      \ land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, also the singers with musical instruments,\
      \ and those who led in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason!\
      \ Treason!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were\
      \ set over the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay\
      \ with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill\
      \ her in the house of the Lord.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So they seized her; and she went by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate\
      \ into the king’s house, and they killed her there. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king,
      that they should be the Lord’s people. '
    17: '¹⁷ And all the people went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They
      broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal
      before the altars. '
    18: '¹⁸ Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the Lord to the
      hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned in the house of the
      Lord, to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the Law
      of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was established by David. '
    19: "¹⁹ And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord, so that\
      \ no one who was in any way unclean should enter. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the
      people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house
      of the Lord; and they went through the Upper Gate to the king’s house, and set
      the king on the throne of the kingdom. '
    21: ²¹ So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they
      had slain Athaliah with the sword.
  24:
    1: '¹ Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years
      in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. '
    2: '² Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada
      the priest. '
    3: "³ And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house
      of the Lord. '
    5: "⁵ Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out\
      \ to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house\
      \ of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly.”\nHowever the\
      \ Levites did not do it quickly. "
    6: '⁶ So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, “Why have
      you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection,
      according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord and of the assembly
      of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?” '
    7: "⁷ For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of\
      \ God, and had also presented all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord\
      \ to the Baals. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then at the king’s command they made a chest, and set it outside at the
      gate of the house of the Lord. '
    9: '⁹ And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to
      the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God had imposed on Israel
      in the wilderness. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions,
      and put them into the chest until all had given. '
    11: "¹¹ So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official\
      \ by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that\
      \ the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest,\
      \ and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered\
      \ money in abundance. \n"
    12: '¹² The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service
      of the house of the Lord; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the
      house of the Lord, and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the
      house of the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored
      the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it. '
    14: "¹⁴ When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the\
      \ king and Jehoiada; they made from it articles for the house of the Lord, articles\
      \ for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they\
      \ offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days\
      \ of Jehoiada. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; he was one hundred
      and thirty years old when he died. '
    16: "¹⁶ And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had\
      \ done good in Israel, both toward God and His house. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down
      to the king. And the king listened to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served
      wooden images and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of
      their trespass. '
    19: "¹⁹ Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the Lord; and they\
      \ testified against them, but they would not listen. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest,
      who stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God: ‘Why do you transgress
      the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken
      the Lord, He also has forsaken you.’ ” '
    21: '²¹ So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned
      him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord. '
    22: "²² Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father\
      \ had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, “The Lord look\
      \ on it, and repay!” \n"
    23: '²³ So it happened in the spring of the year that the army of Syria came up
      against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders
      of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of
      Damascus. '
    24: '²⁴ For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but the
      Lord delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken
      the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. '
    25: "²⁵ And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded),\
      \ his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of\
      \ Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried\
      \ him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath
      the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. '
    27: ²⁷ Now concerning his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing
      of the house of God, indeed they are written in the annals of the book of the
      kings. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
  25:
    1: '¹ Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. '
    2: "² And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a loyal\
      \ heart. \n"
    3: '³ Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he
      executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. '
    4: "⁴ However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the\
      \ Law in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, “The fathers shall\
      \ not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death\
      \ for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands
      and captains of hundreds, according to their fathers’ houses, throughout all
      Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and
      found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, who could
      handle spear and shield. '
    6: '⁶ He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one
      hundred talents of silver. '
    7: '⁷ But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel
      go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—not with any of the children of
      Ephraim. '
    8: "⁸ But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! Even so, God shall make you\
      \ fall before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred\
      \ talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?”\nAnd the man of God answered,\
      \ “The Lord is able to give you much more than this.” "
    10: "¹⁰ So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to\
      \ go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and\
      \ they returned home in great anger. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to
      the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir. '
    12: "¹² Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them\
      \ to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that\
      \ they all were dashed in pieces. \n"
    13: "¹³ But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that\
      \ they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from\
      \ Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites,
      that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up to be his gods,
      and bowed down before them and burned incense to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore the anger of the Lord was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent\
      \ him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of the people,\
      \ which could not rescue their own people from your hand?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So it was, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, “Have we\
      \ made you the king’s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?”\nThen the\
      \ prophet ceased, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you,\
      \ because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz,\
      \ the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another in\
      \ battle.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle
      that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your
      daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by
      and trampled the thistle. '
    19: "¹⁹ Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is\
      \ lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble,\
      \ that you should fall—you and Judah with you?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ But Amaziah would not heed, for it came from God, that He might give them
      into the hand of their enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom. '
    21: '²¹ So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced
      one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. '
    22: '²² And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. '
    23: '²³ Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son
      of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem,
      and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner
      Gate—four hundred cubits. '
    24: "²⁴ And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found\
      \ in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king’s house, and\
      \ hostages, and returned to Samaria. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the
      death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed are they
      not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? '
    27: '²⁷ After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they
      made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they
      sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. '
    28: ²⁸ Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the
      City of Judah.
  26:
    1: '¹ Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and
      made him king instead of his father Amaziah. '
    2: "² He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his\
      \ fathers. \n"
    3: '³ Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that
      his father Amaziah had done. '
    5: "⁵ He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions\
      \ of God; and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the
      wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities
      around Ashdod and among the Philistines. '
    7: '⁷ God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in
      Gur Baal, and against the Meunites. '
    8: "⁸ Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as\
      \ the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong. \n"
    9: '⁹ And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate,
      and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them. '
    10: "¹⁰ Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much\
      \ livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and\
      \ vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies,
      according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah
      the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. '
    12: '¹² The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two
      thousand six hundred. '
    13: '¹³ And under their authority was an army of three hundred and seven thousand
      five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the
      enemy. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets,
      body armor, bows, and slings to cast stones. '
    15: "¹⁵ And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the\
      \ towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread\
      \ far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for
      he transgressed against the Lord his God by entering the temple of the Lord
      to burn incense on the altar of incense. '
    17: '¹⁷ So Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests
      of the Lord—valiant men. '
    18: "¹⁸ And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah,\
      \ to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are\
      \ consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed!\
      \ You shall have no honor from the Lord God.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Uzziah became furious; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense.
      And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead,
      before the priests in the house of the Lord, beside the incense altar. '
    20: "²⁰ And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there,\
      \ on his forehead, he was leprous; so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed\
      \ he also hurried to get out, because the Lord had struck him. \n"
    21: "²¹ King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated\
      \ house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord.\
      \ Then Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah
      the son of Amoz wrote. '
    23: ²³ So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers
      in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a
      leper.” Then Jotham his son reigned in his place.
  27:
    1: '¹ Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. '
    2: "² And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that\
      \ his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of the Lord).\
      \ But still the people acted corruptly. \n"
    3: '³ He built the Upper Gate of the house of the Lord, and he built extensively
      on the wall of Ophel. '
    4: '⁴ Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he
      built fortresses and towers. '
    5: '⁵ He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. And the
      people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand
      kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to
      him in the second and third years also. '
    6: "⁶ So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his\
      \ God. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed
      they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. '
    8: '⁸ He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen
      years in Jerusalem. '
    9: ⁹ So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David.
      Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
  28:
    1: '¹ Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years
      in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord, as
      his father David had done. '
    2: '² For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molded images
      for the Baals. '
    3: '³ He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children
      in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had
      cast out before the children of Israel. '
    4: "⁴ And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and\
      \ under every green tree. \n"
    5: '⁵ Therefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria.
      They defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and
      brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king
      of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter. '
    6: '⁶ For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in
      Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the Lord God of
      their fathers. '
    7: '⁷ Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam
      the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king. '
    8: "⁸ And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred\
      \ thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoil from\
      \ them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. \n"
    9: '⁹ But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out
      before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: “Look, because the Lord
      God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand;
      but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven. '
    10: '¹⁰ And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be
      your male and female slaves; but are you not also guilty before the Lord your
      God? '
    11: "¹¹ Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive\
      \ from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of
      Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and
      Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, '
    13: '¹³ and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for we already
      have offended the Lord. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for
      our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and
      all the assembly. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives,\
      \ and from the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them\
      \ and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they\
      \ let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren\
      \ at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At the same time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. '
    17: '¹⁷ For again the Edomites had come, attacked Judah, and carried away captives. '
    18: '¹⁸ The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the
      South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its
      villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt
      there. '
    19: '¹⁹ For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he
      had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to
      the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Also Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and
      did not assist him. '
    21: "²¹ For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of the Lord, from the\
      \ house of the king, and from the leaders, and he gave it to the king of Assyria;\
      \ but he did not help him. \n"
    22: '²² Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful
      to the Lord. This is that King Ahaz. '
    23: '²³ For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, saying,
      “Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them
      that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. '
    24: '²⁴ So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles
      of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of the Lord, and made for
      himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. '
    25: "²⁵ And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense\
      \ to other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed
      they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. '
    27: ²⁷ So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem;
      but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah
      his son reigned in his place.
  29:
    1: '¹ Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. '
    2: "² And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that\
      \ his father David had done. \n"
    3: '³ In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors
      of the house of the Lord and repaired them. '
    4: '⁴ Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the
      East Square, '
    5: '⁵ and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, sanctify the
      house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy
      place. '
    6: '⁶ For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the Lord our
      God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the dwelling
      place of the Lord, and turned their backs on Him. '
    7: '⁷ They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and
      have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the
      God of Israel. '
    8: '⁸ Therefore the wrath of the Lord fell upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has
      given them up to trouble, to desolation, and to jeering, as you see with your
      eyes. '
    9: "⁹ For indeed, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our\
      \ sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel,
      that His fierce wrath may turn away from us. '
    11: "¹¹ My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has chosen you to stand\
      \ before Him, to serve Him, and that you should minister to Him and burn incense.”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Then these Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of
      Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son
      of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son
      of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; '
    13: '¹³ of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah
      and Mattaniah; '
    14: "¹⁴ of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun,\
      \ Shemaiah and Uzziel. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And they gathered their brethren, sanctified themselves, and went according
      to the commandment of the king, at the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house
      of the Lord. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to\
      \ cleanse it, and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of\
      \ the Lord to the court of the house of the Lord. And the Levites took it out\
      \ and carried it to the Brook Kidron. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now they began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on\
      \ the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the Lord. So they\
      \ sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of\
      \ the first month they finished. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the
      house of the Lord, the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles, and the
      table of the showbread with all its articles. '
    19: "¹⁹ Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside\
      \ in his transgression we have prepared and sanctified; and there they are,\
      \ before the altar of the Lord.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went
      up to the house of the Lord. '
    21: '²¹ And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male
      goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah.
      Then he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar
      of the Lord. '
    22: '²² So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled
      it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the
      altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. '
    23: '²³ Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king
      and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. '
    24: "²⁴ And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar\
      \ as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded\
      \ that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel. \n"
    25: '²⁵ And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with
      stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David,
      of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment
      of the Lord by His prophets. '
    26: '²⁶ The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with
      the trumpets. '
    27: '²⁷ Then Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar.
      And when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord also began, with the
      trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel. '
    28: '²⁸ So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded;
      all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. '
    29: '²⁹ And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present
      with him bowed and worshiped. '
    30: "³⁰ Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise\
      \ to the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises\
      \ with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves
      to the Lord, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house
      of the Lord.” So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and
      as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings. '
    32: '³² And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy
      bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering
      to the Lord. '
    33: '³³ The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. '
    34: '³⁴ But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt
      offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was
      ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites
      were more diligent in sanctifying themselves than the priests. '
    35: "³⁵ Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace\
      \ offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering.\nSo the service\
      \ of the house of the Lord was set in order. "
    36: ³⁶ Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people,
      since the events took place so suddenly.
  30:
    1: '¹ And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim
      and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to
      keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel. '
    2: '² For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed
      to keep the Passover in the second month. '
    3: '³ For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number
      of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together
      at Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly. '
    5: "⁵ So they resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba\
      \ to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel\
      \ at Jerusalem, since they had not done it for a long time in the prescribed\
      \ manner. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from
      the king and his leaders, and spoke according to the command of the king: “Children
      of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will
      return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of
      Assyria. '
    7: '⁷ And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against
      the Lord God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you
      see. '
    8: '⁸ Now do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to
      the Lord; and enter His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve
      the Lord your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you. '
    9: "⁹ For if you return to the Lord, your brethren and your children will be treated\
      \ with compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back\
      \ to this land; for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not\
      \ turn His face from you if you return to Him.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim
      and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them and mocked them. '
    11: '¹¹ Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves
      and came to Jerusalem. '
    12: "¹² Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to\
      \ obey the command of the king and the leaders, at the word of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep
      the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month. '
    14: '¹⁴ They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took
      away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the
      second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves,
      and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ They stood in their place according to their custom, according to the
      Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood received from the
      hand of the Levites. '
    17: '¹⁷ For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves;
      therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for
      everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar,
      and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary
      to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good Lord
      provide atonement for everyone '
    19: '¹⁹ who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though
      he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.” '
    20: "²⁰ And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people. \n"
    21: '²¹ So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast
      of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the
      priests praised the Lord day by day, singing to the Lord, accompanied by loud
      instruments. '
    22: "²² And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites who taught the good\
      \ knowledge of the Lord; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering\
      \ peace offerings and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the whole assembly agreed to keep the feast another seven days, and
      they kept it another seven days with gladness. '
    24: '²⁴ For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven
      thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten
      thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. '
    25: '²⁵ The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, also the priests and Levites, all
      the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of
      Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah. '
    26: '²⁶ So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the
      son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. '
    27: ²⁷ Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their
      voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
  31:
    1: "¹ Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to\
      \ the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, cut down the wooden\
      \ images, and threw down the high places and the altars—from all Judah, Benjamin,\
      \ Ephraim, and Manasseh—until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all\
      \ the children of Israel returned to their own cities, every man to his possession.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according
      to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites
      for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise
      in the gates of the camp of the Lord. '
    3: "³ The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings:\
      \ for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths\
      \ and the New Moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support\
      \ for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the\
      \ Law of the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought
      in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the
      produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. '
    6: "⁶ And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah,\
      \ brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were\
      \ consecrated to the Lord their God they laid in heaps. \n"
    7: '⁷ In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in
      the seventh month. '
    8: '⁸ And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the
      Lord and His people Israel. '
    9: '⁹ Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. '
    10: "¹⁰ And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and\
      \ said, “Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the\
      \ Lord, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the Lord has blessed\
      \ His people; and what is left is this great abundance.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the Lord,
      and they prepared them. '
    12: '¹² Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated
      things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother was the
      next. '
    13: '¹³ Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah,
      Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his
      brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the
      house of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was over
      the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of the Lord and the
      most holy things. '
    15: "¹⁵ And under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah,\
      \ his faithful assistants in the cities of the priests, to distribute allotments\
      \ to their brethren by divisions, to the great as well as the small. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the
      genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the Lord his
      daily portion for the work of his service, by his division, '
    17: '¹⁷ and to the priests who were written in the genealogy according to their
      father’s house, and to the Levites from twenty years old and up according to
      their work, by their divisions, '
    18: "¹⁸ and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their\
      \ wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness\
      \ they sanctified themselves in holiness. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the\
      \ common-lands of their cities, in every single city, there were men who were\
      \ designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests\
      \ and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right
      and true before the Lord his God. '
    21: ²¹ And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in
      the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart.
      So he prospered.
  32:
    1: '¹ After these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and
      entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them
      over to himself. '
    2: '² And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was
      to make war against Jerusalem, '
    3: '³ he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the
      springs which were outside the city; and they helped him. '
    4: '⁴ Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook
      that ran through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and
      find much water?” '
    5: '⁵ And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised
      it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; also he repaired the Millo
      in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance. '
    6: '⁶ Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to
      him in the open square of the city gate, and gave them encouragement, saying, '
    7: '⁷ “Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king
      of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him; for there are more
      with us than with him. '
    8: "⁸ With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God, to help us\
      \ and to fight our battles.” And the people were strengthened by the words of\
      \ Hezekiah king of Judah. \n"
    9: '⁹ After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but
      he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king
      of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: ‘In what do you trust, that you
      remain under siege in Jerusalem? '
    11: '¹¹ Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine
      and by thirst, saying, “The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the
      king of Assyria”? '
    12: '¹² Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and
      commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, “You shall worship before one altar and
      burn incense on it”? '
    13: '¹³ Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of
      other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to
      deliver their lands out of my hand? '
    14: '¹⁴ Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly
      destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be
      able to deliver you from my hand? '
    15: "¹⁵ Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this,\
      \ and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver\
      \ his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your\
      \ God deliver you from my hand?’ ” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Furthermore, his servants spoke against the Lord God and against His servant\
      \ Hezekiah. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ He also wrote letters to revile the Lord God of Israel, and to speak against
      Him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their
      people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from
      my hand.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem
      who were on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, that they might take
      the city. '
    19: "¹⁹ And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the\
      \ people of the earth—the work of men’s hands. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz,
      prayed and cried out to heaven. '
    21: "²¹ Then the Lord sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, leader,\
      \ and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced\
      \ to his own land. And when he had gone into the temple of his god, some of\
      \ his own offspring struck him down with the sword there. \n"
    22: '²² Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the
      hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and
      guided them on every side. '
    23: "²³ And many brought gifts to the Lord at Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah\
      \ king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the Lord;
      and He spoke to him and gave him a sign. '
    25: '²⁵ But Hezekiah did not repay according to the favor shown him, for his heart
      was lifted up; therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem. '
    26: "²⁶ Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the\
      \ days of Hezekiah. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries
      for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for
      all kinds of desirable items; '
    28: '²⁸ storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all
      kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks. '
    29: '²⁹ Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and
      herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property. '
    30: "³⁰ This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and brought\
      \ the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah prospered\
      \ in all his works. \n"
    31: "³¹ However, regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, whom they\
      \ sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land, God withdrew\
      \ from him, in order to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart.\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they are
      written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book
      of the kings of Judah and Israel. '
    33: ³³ So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs
      of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored
      him at his death. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
  33:
    1: '¹ Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five
      years in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² But he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the abominations
      of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel. '
    3: '³ For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down;
      he raised up altars for the Baals, and made wooden images; and he worshiped
      all the host of heaven and served them. '
    4: '⁴ He also built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said,
      “In Jerusalem shall My name be forever.” '
    5: '⁵ And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the
      house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son
      of Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted
      mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke
      Him to anger. '
    7: '⁷ He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of
      God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and
      in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put
      My name forever; '
    8: '⁸ and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have
      appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded
      them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
      hand of Moses.” '
    9: "⁹ So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil\
      \ than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the army of the king
      of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and
      carried him off to Babylon. '
    12: '¹² Now when he was in affliction, he implored the Lord his God, and humbled
      himself greatly before the God of his fathers, '
    13: "¹³ and prayed to Him; and He received his entreaty, heard his supplication,\
      \ and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that\
      \ the Lord was God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side
      of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it enclosed
      Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. Then he put military captains
      in all the fortified cities of Judah. '
    15: '¹⁵ He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord,
      and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord and
      in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city. '
    16: '¹⁶ He also repaired the altar of the Lord, sacrificed peace offerings and
      thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. '
    17: "¹⁷ Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, but only\
      \ to the Lord their God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words
      of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, indeed
      they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. '
    19: '¹⁹ Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and
      trespass, and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images
      and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they are written among the
      sayings of Hozai. '
    20: "²⁰ So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house.\
      \ Then his son Amon reigned in his place. \n"
    21: '²¹ Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two
      years in Jerusalem. '
    22: '²² But he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done;
      for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made,
      and served them. '
    23: "²³ And he did not humble himself before the Lord, as his father Manasseh\
      \ had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house. '
    25: ²⁵ But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against
      King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
  34:
    1: '¹ Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one
      years in Jerusalem. '
    2: "² And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways\
      \ of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began
      to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge
      Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the wooden images, the carved images,
      and the molded images. '
    4: '⁴ They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense
      altars which were above them he cut down; and the wooden images, the carved
      images, and the molded images he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and
      scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. '
    5: '⁵ He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah
      and Jerusalem. '
    6: '⁶ And so he did in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as
      Naphtali and all around, with axes. '
    7: "⁷ When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images, had beaten the\
      \ carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout\
      \ all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    8: '⁸ In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the
      temple, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city,
      and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his
      God. '
    9: '⁹ When they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that
      was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had
      gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel,
      from all Judah and Benjamin, and which they had brought back to Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then they put it in the hand of the foremen who had the oversight of the
      house of the Lord; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of
      the Lord, to repair and restore the house. '
    11: '¹¹ They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber
      for beams, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. '
    12: '¹² And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah
      the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons
      of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites, all of whom were skillful
      with instruments of music, '
    13: "¹³ were over the burden bearers and were overseers of all who did work in\
      \ any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of
      the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord given by
      Moses. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the
      Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. '
    16: '¹⁶ So Shaphan carried the book to the king, bringing the king word, saying,
      “All that was committed to your servants they are doing. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the Lord,
      and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has\
      \ given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Thus it happened, when the king heard the words of the Law, that he tore
      his clothes. '
    20: '²⁰ Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the
      son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying, '
    21: "²¹ “Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for those who are left in Israel\
      \ and Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the\
      \ wrath of the Lord that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept\
      \ the word of the Lord, to do according to all that is written in this book.”\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² So Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess,\
      \ the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe.\
      \ (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her to that\
      \ effect. \n"
    23: '²³ Then she answered them, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel, ‘Tell the man
      who sent you to Me, '
    24: '²⁴ “Thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and
      on its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which they have
      read before the king of Judah, '
    25: '²⁵ because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they
      might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath
      will be poured out on this place, and not be quenched.’ ” ’ '
    26: '²⁶ But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, in
      this manner you shall speak to him, ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel: “Concerning
      the words which you have heard— '
    27: '²⁷ because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when
      you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you
      humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I
      also have heard you,” says the Lord. '
    28: "²⁸ “Surely I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to\
      \ your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I\
      \ will bring on this place and its inhabitants.” ’ ” So they brought back word\
      \ to the king. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. '
    30: '³⁰ The king went up to the house of the Lord, with all the men of Judah and
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the Levites, and all the people,
      great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the
      Covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord,
      to follow the Lord, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His
      statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant
      that were written in this book. '
    32: '³² And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand.
      So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God
      of their fathers. '
    33: ³³ Thus Josiah removed all the abominations from all the country that belonged
      to the children of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel diligently
      serve the Lord their God. All his days they did not depart from following the
      Lord God of their fathers.
  35:
    1: '¹ Now Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered
      the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month. '
    2: '² And he set the priests in their duties and encouraged them for the service
      of the house of the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the
      Lord: “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of
      Israel, built. It shall no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve the
      Lord your God and His people Israel. '
    4: '⁴ Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ houses, according to your
      divisions, following the written instruction of David king of Israel and the
      written instruction of Solomon his son. '
    5: '⁵ And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses
      of your brethren the lay people, and according to the division of the father’s
      house of the Levites. '
    6: "⁶ So slaughter the Passover offerings, consecrate yourselves, and prepare\
      \ them for your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord\
      \ by the hand of Moses.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Josiah gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock, all
      for Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand,
      as well as three thousand cattle; these were from the king’s possessions. '
    8: '⁸ And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the
      Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to
      the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock,
      and three hundred cattle. '
    9: "⁹ Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel\
      \ and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings\
      \ five thousand from the flock and five hundred cattle. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and
      the Levites in their divisions, according to the king’s command. '
    11: '¹¹ And they slaughtered the Passover offerings; and the priests sprinkled
      the blood with their hands, while the Levites skinned the animals. '
    12: '¹² Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the
      divisions of the fathers’ houses of the lay people, to offer to the Lord, as
      it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the cattle. '
    13: '¹³ Also they roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the ordinance;
      but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in pans,
      and divided them quickly among all the lay people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests,
      because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings
      and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves
      and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to\
      \ the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also the\
      \ gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not have to leave their position,\
      \ because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keep the
      Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, according to
      the command of King Josiah. '
    17: '¹⁷ And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that
      time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. '
    18: '¹⁸ There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of
      Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover
      as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were
      present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    19: "¹⁹ In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt
      came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against
      him. '
    21: '²¹ But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king
      of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which
      I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God,
      who is with me, lest He destroy you.” '
    22: "²² Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself\
      \ so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from\
      \ the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo. \n"
    23: '²³ And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take
      me away, for I am severely wounded.” '
    24: "²⁴ His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the\
      \ second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died,\
      \ and was buried in one of the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem\
      \ mourned for Josiah. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men\
      \ and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it\
      \ a custom in Israel; and indeed they are written in the Laments. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what
      was written in the Law of the Lord, '
    27: ²⁷ and his deeds from first to last, indeed they are written in the book of
      the kings of Israel and Judah.
  36:
    1: '¹ Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him
      king in his father’s place in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned
      three months in Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ Now the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land
      a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. '
    4: "⁴ Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and\
      \ Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his\
      \ brother and carried him off to Egypt. \n"
    5: '⁵ Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned
      eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord his God. '
    6: '⁶ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze
      fetters to carry him off to Babylon. '
    7: '⁷ Nebuchadnezzar also carried off some of the articles from the house of the
      Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. '
    8: "⁸ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he did, and\
      \ what was found against him, indeed they are written in the book of the kings\
      \ of Israel and Judah. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. \n"
    9: '⁹ Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem
      three months and ten days. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar summoned him and took him\
      \ to Babylon, with the costly articles from the house of the Lord, and made\
      \ Zedekiah, Jehoiakim’s brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned
      eleven years in Jerusalem. '
    12: '¹² He did evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and did not humble himself
      before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear
      an oath by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning
      to the Lord God of Israel. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed more\
      \ and more, according to all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the\
      \ house of the Lord which He had consecrated in Jerusalem. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And the Lord God of their fathers sent warnings to them by His messengers,
      rising up early and sending them, because He had compassion on His people and
      on His dwelling place. '
    16: "¹⁶ But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed\
      \ at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till\
      \ there was no remedy. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed
      their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion
      on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave them all into his hand. '
    18: '¹⁸ And all the articles from the house of God, great and small, the treasures
      of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king and of his leaders,
      all these he took to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned
      all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions. '
    20: '²⁰ And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where
      they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, '
    21: "²¹ to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land\
      \ had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to\
      \ fulfill seventy years. \n"
    22: "²² Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord\
      \ by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit\
      \ of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his\
      \ kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying, \n"
    23: "²³ Thus says Cyrus king of Persia:\nAll the kingdoms of the earth the Lord\
      \ God of heaven has given me. And He has commanded me to build Him a house at\
      \ Jerusalem which is in Judah. Who is among you of all His people? May the Lord\
      \ his God be with him, and let him go up!"
