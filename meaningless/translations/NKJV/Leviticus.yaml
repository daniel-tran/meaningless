Leviticus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting,
      saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When any one of you\
      \ brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the livestock—of\
      \ the herd and of the flock. \n"
    3: '³ ‘If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male
      without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle
      of meeting before the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will
      be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. '
    5: '⁵ He shall kill the bull before the Lord; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall
      bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the
      door of the tabernacle of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood
      in order on the fire. '
    8: '⁸ Then the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat
      in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar; '
    9: "⁹ but he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall\
      \ burn all on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet\
      \ aroma to the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If his offering is of the flocks—of the sheep or of the goats—as a burnt
      sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the Lord; and the
      priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar. '
    12: '¹² And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the
      priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar; '
    13: "¹³ but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water. Then the priest\
      \ shall bring it all and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering\
      \ made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘And if the burnt sacrifice of his offering to the Lord is of birds, then
      he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it
      on the altar; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar. '
    16: '¹⁶ And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the
      altar on the east side, into the place for ashes. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then he shall split it at its wings, but shall not divide it completely;
      and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire.
      It is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ ‘When anyone offers a grain offering to the Lord, his offering shall be
      of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it. '
    2: '² He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests, one of whom shall take from
      it his handful of fine flour and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest
      shall burn it as a memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, a sweet
      aroma to the Lord. '
    3: "³ The rest of the grain offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is most\
      \ holy of the offerings to the Lord made by fire. \n"
    4: '⁴ ‘And if you bring as an offering a grain offering baked in the oven, it
      shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers
      anointed with oil. '
    5: '⁵ But if your offering is a grain offering baked in a pan, it shall be of
      fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil. '
    6: "⁶ You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ ‘If your offering is a grain offering baked in a covered pan, it shall be
      made of fine flour with oil. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the Lord.
      And when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar. '
    9: '⁹ Then the priest shall take from the grain offering a memorial portion, and
      burn it on the altar. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ And what is left of the grain offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.\
      \ It is most holy of the offerings to the Lord made by fire. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘No grain offering which you bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven,
      for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey in any offering to the Lord made
      by fire. '
    12: '¹² As for the offering of the firstfruits, you shall offer them to the Lord,
      but they shall not be burned on the altar for a sweet aroma. '
    13: "¹³ And every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt;\
      \ you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from\
      \ your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘If you offer a grain offering of your firstfruits to the Lord, you shall
      offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits green heads of grain roasted
      on the fire, grain beaten from full heads. '
    15: '¹⁵ And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it. It is a grain
      offering. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then the priest shall burn the memorial portion: part of its beaten grain
      and part of its oil, with all the frankincense, as an offering made by fire
      to the Lord.'
  3:
    1: '¹ ‘When his offering is a sacrifice of a peace offering, if he offers it of
      the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the
      Lord. '
    2: '² And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the
      door of the tabernacle of meeting; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle
      the blood all around on the altar. '
    3: '³ Then he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
      made by fire to the Lord. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that
      is on the entrails, '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty
      lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; '
    5: "⁵ and Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which\
      \ is on the wood that is on the fire, as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ ‘If his offering as a sacrifice of a peace offering to the Lord is of the
      flock, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. '
    7: '⁷ If he offers a lamb as his offering, then he shall offer it before the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before\
      \ the tabernacle of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood all around\
      \ on the altar. \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘Then he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as an offering
      made by fire to the Lord, its fat and the whole fat tail which he shall remove
      close to the backbone. And the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat
      that is on the entrails, '
    10: '¹⁰ the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty
      lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; '
    11: "¹¹ and the priest shall burn them on the altar as food, an offering made\
      \ by fire to the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² ‘And if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ He shall lay his hand on its head and kill it before the tabernacle of
      meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then he shall offer from it his offering, as an offering made by fire
      to the Lord. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the
      entrails, '
    15: '¹⁵ the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty
      lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; '
    16: "¹⁶ and the priest shall burn them on the altar as food, an offering made\
      \ by fire for a sweet aroma; all the fat is the Lord’s. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all
      your dwellings: you shall eat neither fat nor blood.’ ”'
  4:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If a person sins unintentionally
      against any of the commandments of the Lord in anything which ought not to be
      done, and does any of them, '
    3: '³ if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then let him
      offer to the Lord for his sin which he has sinned a young bull without blemish
      as a sin offering. '
    4: '⁴ He shall bring the bull to the door of the tabernacle of meeting before
      the Lord, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and kill the bull before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it
      to the tabernacle of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood
      seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of
      sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of meeting; and he
      shall pour the remaining blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt
      offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. '
    8: '⁸ He shall take from it all the fat of the bull as the sin offering. The fat
      that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails, '
    9: '⁹ the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty
      lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove, '
    10: '¹⁰ as it was taken from the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offering;
      and the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering. '
    11: '¹¹ But the bull’s hide and all its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails
      and offal— '
    12: "¹² the whole bull he shall carry outside the camp to a clean place, where\
      \ the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are\
      \ poured out it shall be burned. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and the
      thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something
      against any of the commandments of the Lord in anything which should not be
      done, and are guilty; '
    14: '¹⁴ when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly
      shall offer a young bull for the sin, and bring it before the tabernacle of
      meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of
      the bull before the Lord. Then the bull shall be killed before the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ The anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the tabernacle
      of meeting. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven
      times before the Lord, in front of the veil. '
    18: '¹⁸ And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is
      before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of meeting; and he shall pour the
      remaining blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the
      door of the tabernacle of meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ He shall take all the fat from it and burn it on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ And he shall do with the bull as he did with the bull as a sin offering;
      thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and it
      shall be forgiven them. '
    21: "²¹ Then he shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned\
      \ the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly. \n"
    22: '²² ‘When a ruler has sinned, and done something unintentionally against any
      of the commandments of the Lord his God in anything which should not be done,
      and is guilty, '
    23: '²³ or if his sin which he has committed comes to his knowledge, he shall
      bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a male without blemish. '
    24: '²⁴ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it at the
      place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord. It is a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
      put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour its blood at the
      base of the altar of burnt offering. '
    26: "²⁶ And he shall burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice\
      \ of the peace offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning\
      \ his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. \n"
    27: '²⁷ ‘If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally by doing something
      against any of the commandments of the Lord in anything which ought not to be
      done, and is guilty, '
    28: '²⁸ or if his sin which he has committed comes to his knowledge, then he shall
      bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his
      sin which he has committed. '
    29: '²⁹ And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the
      sin offering at the place of the burnt offering. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on
      the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining blood at
      the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ He shall remove all its fat, as fat is removed from the sacrifice of the\
      \ peace offering; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet aroma\
      \ to the Lord. So the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven\
      \ him. \n"
    32: '³² ‘If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he shall bring a female without
      blemish. '
    33: '³³ Then he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it
      as a sin offering at the place where they kill the burnt offering. '
    34: '³⁴ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
      put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining
      blood at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ He shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the
      sacrifice of the peace offering. Then the priest shall burn it on the altar,
      according to the offerings made by fire to the Lord. So the priest shall make
      atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
  5:
    1: "¹ ‘If a person sins in hearing the utterance of an oath, and is a witness,\
      \ whether he has seen or known of the matter—if he does not tell it, he bears\
      \ guilt. \n"
    2: '² ‘Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of
      an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean
      creeping things, and he is unaware of it, he also shall be unclean and guilty. '
    3: "³ Or if he touches human uncleanness—whatever uncleanness with which a man\
      \ may be defiled, and he is unaware of it—when he realizes it, then he shall\
      \ be guilty. \n"
    4: "⁴ ‘Or if a person swears, speaking thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil\
      \ or to do good, whatever it is that a man may pronounce by an oath, and he\
      \ is unaware of it—when he realizes it, then he shall be guilty in any of these\
      \ matters. \n"
    5: '⁵ ‘And it shall be, when he is guilty in any of these matters, that he shall
      confess that he has sinned in that thing; '
    6: "⁶ and he shall bring his trespass offering to the Lord for his sin which he\
      \ has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats as a\
      \ sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ ‘If he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring to the Lord, for
      his trespass which he has committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons: one
      as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. '
    8: '⁸ And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for
      the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not
      divide it completely. '
    9: '⁹ Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side
      of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of
      the altar. It is a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the prescribed\
      \ manner. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which\
      \ he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
      then he who sinned shall bring for his offering one-tenth of an ephah of fine
      flour as a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, nor shall he put frankincense
      on it, for it is a sin offering. '
    12: '¹² Then he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful
      of it as a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar according to the offerings
      made by fire to the Lord. It is a sin offering. '
    13: "¹³ The priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin that he has committed\
      \ in any of these matters; and it shall be forgiven him. The rest shall be the\
      \ priest’s as a grain offering.’ ” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    15: '¹⁵ “If a person commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally in regard to
      the holy things of the Lord, then he shall bring to the Lord as his trespass
      offering a ram without blemish from the flocks, with your valuation in shekels
      of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, as a trespass offering. '
    16: "¹⁶ And he shall make restitution for the harm that he has done in regard\
      \ to the holy thing, and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest.\
      \ So the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,\
      \ and it shall be forgiven him. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “If a person sins, and commits any of these things which are forbidden
      to be done by the commandments of the Lord, though he does not know it, yet
      he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity. '
    18: '¹⁸ And he shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock,
      with your valuation, as a trespass offering. So the priest shall make atonement
      for him regarding his ignorance in which he erred and did not know it, and it
      shall be forgiven him. '
    19: ¹⁹ It is a trespass offering; he has certainly trespassed against the Lord.”
  6:
    1: '¹ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² “If a person sins and commits a trespass against the Lord by lying to his
      neighbor about what was delivered to him for safekeeping, or about a pledge,
      or about a robbery, or if he has extorted from his neighbor, '
    3: '³ or if he has found what was lost and lies concerning it, and swears falsely—in
      any one of these things that a man may do in which he sins: '
    4: '⁴ then it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore
      what he has stolen, or the thing which he has extorted, or what was delivered
      to him for safekeeping, or the lost thing which he found, '
    5: '⁵ or all that about which he has sworn falsely. He shall restore its full
      value, add one-fifth more to it, and give it to whomever it belongs, on the
      day of his trespass offering. '
    6: '⁶ And he shall bring his trespass offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish
      from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering, to the priest. '
    7: "⁷ So the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall\
      \ be forgiven for any one of these things that he may have done in which he\
      \ trespasses.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering:
      The burnt offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night until morning,
      and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers
      he shall put on his body, and take up the ashes of the burnt offering which
      the fire has consumed on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he shall take off his garments, put on other garments, and carry
      the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. '
    12: '¹² And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not be
      put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt
      offering in order on it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings. '
    13: "¹³ A fire shall always be burning on the altar; it shall never go out. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘This is the law of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer
      it on the altar before the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall take from it his handful of the fine flour of the grain offering,
      with its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the grain offering, and shall
      burn it on the altar for a sweet aroma, as a memorial to the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the remainder of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; with unleavened
      bread it shall be eaten in a holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of meeting
      they shall eat it. '
    17: '¹⁷ It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of
      My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the trespass
      offering. '
    18: "¹⁸ All the males among the children of Aaron may eat it. It shall be a statute\
      \ forever in your generations concerning the offerings made by fire to the Lord.\
      \ Everyone who touches them must be holy.’ ” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, which they shall offer to
      the Lord, beginning on the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of
      fine flour as a daily grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of
      it at night. '
    21: '²¹ It shall be made in a pan with oil. When it is mixed, you shall bring
      it in. The baked pieces of the grain offering you shall offer for a sweet aroma
      to the Lord. '
    22: '²² The priest from among his sons, who is anointed in his place, shall offer
      it. It is a statute forever to the Lord. It shall be wholly burned. '
    23: "²³ For every grain offering for the priest shall be wholly burned. It shall\
      \ not be eaten.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Also the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering:
      In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed
      before the Lord. It is most holy. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall
      be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of meeting. '
    27: '²⁷ Everyone who touches its flesh must be holy. And when its blood is sprinkled
      on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled, in a holy place. '
    28: '²⁸ But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it
      is boiled in a bronze pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water. '
    29: '²⁹ All the males among the priests may eat it. It is most holy. '
    30: ³⁰ But no sin offering from which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle
      of meeting, to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten. It shall be
      burned in the fire.
  7:
    1: '¹ ‘Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering (it is most holy): '
    2: '² In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the trespass
      offering. And its blood he shall sprinkle all around on the altar. '
    3: '³ And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers
      the entrails, '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty
      lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; '
    5: '⁵ and the priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire
      to the Lord. It is a trespass offering. '
    6: '⁶ Every male among the priests may eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place.
      It is most holy. '
    7: '⁷ The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them
      both: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. '
    8: '⁸ And the priest who offers anyone’s burnt offering, that priest shall have
      for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered. '
    9: '⁹ Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared
      in the covered pan, or in a pan, shall be the priest’s who offers it. '
    10: "¹⁰ Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all\
      \ the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other. \n"
    11: '¹¹ ‘This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer
      to the Lord: '
    12: '¹² If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer, with the sacrifice
      of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed
      with oil, or cakes of blended flour mixed with oil. '
    13: '¹³ Besides the cakes, as his offering he shall offer leavened bread with
      the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering. '
    14: "¹⁴ And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering as a heave offering\
      \ to the Lord. It shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the\
      \ peace offering. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ ‘The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering for thanksgiving shall
      be eaten the same day it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until morning. '
    16: '¹⁶ But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering,
      it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; but on the next
      day the remainder of it also may be eaten; '
    17: '¹⁷ the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day must be burned
      with fire. '
    18: "¹⁸ And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten\
      \ at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, nor shall it be imputed\
      \ to him; it shall be an abomination to him who offers it, and the person who\
      \ eats of it shall bear guilt. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ ‘The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall
      be burned with fire. And as for the clean flesh, all who are clean may eat of
      it. '
    20: '²⁰ But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering
      that belongs to the Lord, while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off
      from his people. '
    21: "²¹ Moreover the person who touches any unclean thing, such as human uncleanness,\
      \ an unclean animal, or any abominable unclean thing, and who eats the flesh\
      \ of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to the Lord, that person\
      \ shall be cut off from his people.’ ” \n"
    22: '²² And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    23: '²³ “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘You shall not eat any fat,
      of ox or sheep or goat. '
    24: '²⁴ And the fat of an animal that dies naturally, and the fat of what is torn
      by wild beasts, may be used in any other way; but you shall by no means eat
      it. '
    25: '²⁵ For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men offer an offering
      made by fire to the Lord, the person who eats it shall be cut off from his people. '
    26: '²⁶ Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether
      of bird or beast. '
    27: "²⁷ Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.’\
      \ ” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    29: '²⁹ “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘He who offers the sacrifice
      of his peace offering to the Lord shall bring his offering to the Lord from
      the sacrifice of his peace offering. '
    30: '³⁰ His own hands shall bring the offerings made by fire to the Lord. The
      fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering
      before the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be
      Aaron’s and his sons’. '
    32: '³² Also the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a heave offering
      from the sacrifices of your peace offerings. '
    33: '³³ He among the sons of Aaron, who offers the blood of the peace offering
      and the fat, shall have the right thigh for his part. '
    34: "³⁴ For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering\
      \ I have taken from the children of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace\
      \ offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons from\
      \ the children of Israel by a statute forever.’ ” \n"
    35: '³⁵ This is the consecrated portion for Aaron and his sons, from the offerings
      made by fire to the Lord, on the day when Moses presented them to minister to
      the Lord as priests. '
    36: "³⁶ The Lord commanded this to be given to them by the children of Israel,\
      \ on the day that He anointed them, by a statute forever throughout their generations.\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering,
      the trespass offering, the consecrations, and the sacrifice of the peace offering, '
    38: ³⁸ which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded
      the children of Israel to offer their offerings to the Lord in the Wilderness
      of Sinai.
  8:
    1: '¹ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil,
      a bull as the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; '
    3: "³ and gather all the congregation together at the door of the tabernacle of\
      \ meeting.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And the congregation was gathered
      together at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. '
    5: "⁵ And Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the Lord commanded to\
      \ be done.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ And he put the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, clothed him with
      the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the intricately woven
      band of the ephod, and with it tied the ephod on him. '
    8: '⁸ Then he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim
      in the breastplate. '
    9: "⁹ And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he\
      \ put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all
      that was in it, and consecrated them. '
    11: '¹¹ He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and
      all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them. '
    12: "¹² And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him,\
      \ to consecrate him. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put tunics on them, girded them with\
      \ sashes, and put hats on them, as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And he brought the bull for the sin offering. Then Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering, '
    15: '¹⁵ and Moses killed it. Then he took the blood, and put some on the horns
      of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured
      the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement for
      it. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached
      to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the
      altar. '
    17: "¹⁷ But the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its offal, he burned with fire\
      \ outside the camp, as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the head of the ram, '
    19: '¹⁹ and Moses killed it. Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head, the pieces,
      and the fat. '
    21: "²¹ Then he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the\
      \ whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet aroma, an offering\
      \ made by fire to the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    22: '²² And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. Then Aaron and
      his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, '
    23: '²³ and Moses killed it. Also he took some of its blood and put it on the
      tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe
      of his right foot. '
    24: '²⁴ Then he brought Aaron’s sons. And Moses put some of the blood on the tips
      of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes
      of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. '
    25: '²⁵ Then he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails,
      the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the
      right thigh; '
    26: '²⁶ and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord he took
      one unleavened cake, a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one wafer, and put
      them on the fat and on the right thigh; '
    27: '²⁷ and he put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved
      them as a wave offering before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar, on
      the burnt offering. They were consecration offerings for a sweet aroma. That
      was an offering made by fire to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the Lord.\
      \ It was Moses’ part of the ram of consecration, as the Lord had commanded Moses.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which\
      \ was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons,\
      \ and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments,\
      \ his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. \n"
    31: '³¹ And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the
      tabernacle of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket
      of consecration offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall
      eat it.’ '
    32: '³² What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. '
    33: '³³ And you shall not go outside the door of the tabernacle of meeting for
      seven days, until the days of your consecration are ended. For seven days he
      shall consecrate you. '
    34: '³⁴ As he has done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement
      for you. '
    35: '³⁵ Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tabernacle of meeting day
      and night for seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, so that you may not
      die; for so I have been commanded.” '
    36: ³⁶ So Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord had commanded by
      the hand of Moses.
  9:
    1: '¹ It came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and
      the elders of Israel. '
    2: '² And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering
      and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord. '
    3: '³ And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘Take a kid of the
      goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without
      blemish, as a burnt offering, '
    4: "⁴ also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord,\
      \ and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the Lord will appear to you.’\
      \ ” \n"
    5: '⁵ So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And
      all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Then Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord commanded you to do,
      and the glory of the Lord will appear to you.” '
    7: "⁷ And Moses said to Aaron, “Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your\
      \ burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer\
      \ the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering,
      which was for himself. '
    9: '⁹ Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger
      in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the
      base of the altar. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin
      offering he burned on the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    11: "¹¹ The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp. \n"
    12: '¹² And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented to him the
      blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar. '
    13: '¹³ Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head,
      and he burned them on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt\
      \ offering on the altar. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the
      sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the
      first one. '
    16: '¹⁶ And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the prescribed
      manner. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it\
      \ on the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He also killed the bull and the ram as sacrifices of peace offerings,
      which were for the people. And Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which
      he sprinkled all around on the altar, '
    19: '¹⁹ and the fat from the bull and the ram—the fatty tail, what covers the
      entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver; '
    20: '²⁰ and they put the fat on the breasts. Then he burned the fat on the altar; '
    21: "²¹ but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before\
      \ the Lord, as Moses had commanded. \n"
    22: '²² Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down
      from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings. '
    23: '²³ And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out
      and blessed the people. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people, '
    24: ²⁴ and fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering
      and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted and fell
      on their faces.
  10:
    1: '¹ Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire
      in it, put incense on it, and offered profane fire before the Lord, which He
      had not commanded them. '
    2: '² So fire went out from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the
      Lord. '
    3: "³ And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke, saying:\n‘By those\
      \ who come near Me\nI must be regarded as holy;\nAnd before all the people\n\
      I must be glorified.’ ”\nSo Aaron held his peace. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of
      Aaron, and said to them, “Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary
      out of the camp.” '
    5: "⁵ So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses\
      \ had said. \n"
    6: '⁶ And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not uncover
      your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the
      people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
      which the Lord has kindled. '
    7: "⁷ You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you\
      \ die, for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.” And they did according\
      \ to the word of Moses. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying: '
    9: '⁹ “Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when
      you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever
      throughout your generations, '
    10: '¹⁰ that you may distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean
      and clean, '
    11: "¹¹ and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the\
      \ Lord has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were
      left: “Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings made by fire to
      the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy. '
    13: '¹³ You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’
      due, of the sacrifices made by fire to the Lord; for so I have been commanded. '
    14: '¹⁴ The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you
      shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for
      they are your due and your sons’ due, which are given from the sacrifices of
      peace offerings of the children of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they\
      \ shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer as a wave offering\
      \ before the Lord. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a statute\
      \ forever, as the Lord has commanded.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Moses made careful inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and
      there it was—burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons
      of Aaron who were left, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is
      most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation,
      to make atonement for them before the Lord? '
    18: "¹⁸ See! Its blood was not brought inside the holy place; indeed you should\
      \ have eaten it in a holy place, as I commanded.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And Aaron said to Moses, “Look, this day they have offered their sin offering
      and their burnt offering before the Lord, and such things have befallen me!
      If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the sight
      of the Lord?” '
    20: ²⁰ So when Moses heard that, he was content.
  11:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the animals which you
      may eat among all the animals that are on the earth: '
    3: '³ Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing
      the cud—that you may eat. '
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those
      that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have
      cloven hooves, is unclean to you; '
    5: '⁵ the rock hyrax, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves,
      is unclean to you; '
    6: '⁶ the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean
      to you; '
    7: '⁷ and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does
      not chew the cud, is unclean to you. '
    8: "⁸ Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.\
      \ They are unclean to you. \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘These you may eat of all that are in the water: whatever in the water has
      fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers—that you may eat. '
    10: '¹⁰ But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales,
      all that move in the water or any living thing which is in the water, they are
      an abomination to you. '
    11: '¹¹ They shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat their flesh, but
      you shall regard their carcasses as an abomination. '
    12: "¹² Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales—that shall be an abomination\
      \ to you. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall
      not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard, '
    14: '¹⁴ the kite, and the falcon after its kind; '
    15: '¹⁵ every raven after its kind, '
    16: '¹⁶ the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its
      kind; '
    17: '¹⁷ the little owl, the fisher owl, and the screech owl; '
    18: '¹⁸ the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture; '
    19: "¹⁹ the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. \n"
    20: '²⁰ ‘All flying insects that creep on all fours shall be an abomination to
      you. '
    21: '²¹ Yet these you may eat of every flying insect that creeps on all fours:
      those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth. '
    22: '²² These you may eat: the locust after its kind, the destroying locust after
      its kind, the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind. '
    23: "²³ But all other flying insects which have four feet shall be an abomination\
      \ to you. \n"
    24: '²⁴ ‘By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any
      of them shall be unclean until evening; '
    25: '²⁵ whoever carries part of the carcass of any of them shall wash his clothes
      and be unclean until evening: '
    26: '²⁶ The carcass of any animal which divides the foot, but is not cloven-hoofed
      or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches it shall be
      unclean. '
    27: '²⁷ And whatever goes on its paws, among all kinds of animals that go on all
      fours, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches any such carcass shall be unclean
      until evening. '
    28: "²⁸ Whoever carries any such carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean\
      \ until evening. It is unclean to you. \n"
    29: '²⁹ ‘These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep
      on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard after its kind; '
    30: '³⁰ the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and
      the chameleon. '
    31: '³¹ These are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when
      they are dead shall be unclean until evening. '
    32: '³² Anything on which any of them falls, when they are dead shall be unclean,
      whether it is any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever item it
      is, in which any work is done, it must be put in water. And it shall be unclean
      until evening; then it shall be clean. '
    33: '³³ Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls you shall break; and whatever
      is in it shall be unclean: '
    34: '³⁴ in such a vessel, any edible food upon which water falls becomes unclean,
      and any drink that may be drunk from it becomes unclean. '
    35: '³⁵ And everything on which a part of any such carcass falls shall be unclean;
      whether it is an oven or cooking stove, it shall be broken down; for they are
      unclean, and shall be unclean to you. '
    36: '³⁶ Nevertheless a spring or a cistern, in which there is plenty of water,
      shall be clean, but whatever touches any such carcass becomes unclean. '
    37: '³⁷ And if a part of any such carcass falls on any planting seed which is
      to be sown, it remains clean. '
    38: "³⁸ But if water is put on the seed, and if a part of any such carcass falls\
      \ on it, it becomes unclean to you. \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘And if any animal which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass
      shall be unclean until evening. '
    40: "⁴⁰ He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until\

      him unclean. It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard. '
    31: '³¹ But if the priest examines the scaly sore, and indeed it does not appear

      is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance
      of leprosy on the skin of the body, '

      These are holy garments. Therefore he shall wash his body in water, and put
      them on. '
    5: "⁵ And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two kids\
      \ of the goats as a sin offering, and one ram as a burnt offering. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering, which is for himself, and

    8: '⁸ Then Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for the Lord and the
      other lot for the scapegoat. '
    9: '⁹ And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the Lord’s lot fell, and offer it
      as a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented\
      \ alive before the Lord, to make atonement upon it, and to let it go as the\

    11: '¹¹ “And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself,

    12: '¹² Then he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar
      before the Lord, with his hands full of sweet incense beaten fine, and bring
      it inside the veil. '
    13: '¹³ And he shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, that the cloud

      in the midst of their uncleanness. '
    17: '¹⁷ There shall be no man in the tabernacle of meeting when he goes in to

    27: '²⁷ The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose

      who is born in his house may eat his food. '

    8: "⁸ But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord for seven days.\
      \ The seventh day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no customary work\

    9: '⁹ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into
      the land which I give to you, and reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf
      of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted on your behalf;

    12: '¹² And you shall offer on that day, when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb
      of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed
      with oil, an offering made by fire to the Lord, for a sweet aroma; and its drink
      offering shall be of wine, one-fourth of a hin. '
    14: "¹⁴ You shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor fresh grain until the\
      \ same day that you have brought an offering to your God; it shall be a statute\
      \ forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ ‘And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from
      the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall
      be completed. '
    16: '¹⁶ Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall
      offer a new grain offering to the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall bring from your dwellings two wave loaves of two-tenths of an
      ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven. They are
      the firstfruits to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs of the first year, without
      blemish, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be as a burnt offering to
      the Lord, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made
      by fire for a sweet aroma to the Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats as a sin offering, and two
      male lambs of the first year as a sacrifice of a peace offering. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave
      offering before the Lord, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the Lord

    26: '²⁶ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    27: '²⁷ “Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement.

    32: "³² It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your\
      \ souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening,\
      \ you shall celebrate your sabbath.” \n"
    33: '³³ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    34: '³⁴ “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh
      month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. '
    35: '³⁵ On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary

    36: "³⁶ For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On\

      and a grain offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, everything on its day— '
    38: "³⁸ besides the Sabbaths of the Lord, besides your gifts, besides all your\

      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered
      in the fruit of the land, you shall keep the feast of the Lord for seven days;
      on the first day there shall be a sabbath-rest, and on the eighth day a sabbath-rest. '
    40: '⁴⁰ And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful
      trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the
      brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. '
    41: '⁴¹ You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year. It
      shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the
      seventh month. '
    42: '⁴² You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites
      shall dwell in booths, '
    43: "⁴³ that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell\
      \ in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your\
      \ God.’ ” \n"
    44: ⁴⁴ So Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² “Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure oil of pressed
      olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually. '
    3: '³ Outside the veil of the Testimony, in the tabernacle of meeting, Aaron shall
      be in charge of it from evening until morning before the Lord continually; it
      shall be a statute forever in your generations. '
    4: "⁴ He shall be in charge of the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the\
      \ Lord continually. \n"
    5: '⁵ “And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Two-tenths
      of an ephah shall be in each cake. '
    6: '⁶ You shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the pure gold table before
      the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread
      for a memorial, an offering made by fire to the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, being
      taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. '
    9: "⁹ And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy\
      \ place; for it is most holy to him from the offerings of the Lord made by fire,\
      \ by a perpetual statute.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went
      out among the children of Israel; and this Israelite woman’s son and a man of
      Israel fought each other in the camp. '
    11: '¹¹ And the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed;
      and so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith the daughter
      of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) '
    12: "¹² Then they put him in custody, that the mind of the Lord might be shown\
      \ to them. \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    14: "¹⁴ “Take outside the camp him who has cursed; then let all who heard him\
      \ lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Whoever curses
      his God shall bear his sin. '
    16: "¹⁶ And whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death.\
      \ All the congregation shall certainly stone him, the stranger as well as him\
      \ who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall\
      \ be put to death. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Whoever kills any man shall surely be put to death. '
    18: "¹⁸ Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, animal for animal. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ ‘If a man causes disfigurement of his neighbor, as he has done, so shall
      it be done to him— '
    20: '²⁰ fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused
      disfigurement of a man, so shall it be done to him. '
    21: '²¹ And whoever kills an animal shall restore it; but whoever kills a man
      shall be put to death. '
    22: "²² You shall have the same law for the stranger and for one from your own\
      \ country; for I am the Lord your God.’ ” \n"
    23: ²³ Then Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they took outside the camp
      him who had cursed, and stoned him with stones. So the children of Israel did
      as the Lord commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: '¹ And the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the
      land which I give you, then the land shall keep a sabbath to the Lord. '
    3: '³ Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard,
      and gather its fruit; '
    4: '⁴ but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the
      land, a sabbath to the Lord. You shall neither sow your field nor prune your
      vineyard. '
    5: '⁵ What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather
      the grapes of your untended vine, for it is a year of rest for the land. '
    6: '⁶ And the sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you: for you, your
      male and female servants, your hired man, and the stranger who dwells with you, '
    7: "⁷ for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land—all its produce\
      \ shall be for food. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven
      years; and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine
      years. '
    9: '⁹ Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day
      of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make the trumpet to
      sound throughout all your land. '
    10: '¹⁰ And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
      all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each
      of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family. '
    11: '¹¹ That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you; in it you shall neither
      sow nor reap what grows of its own accord, nor gather the grapes of your untended
      vine. '
    12: "¹² For it is the Jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat its produce\
      \ from the field. \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession. '
    14: '¹⁴ And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s
      hand, you shall not oppress one another. '
    15: '¹⁵ According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from
      your neighbor, and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to
      you. '
    16: '¹⁶ According to the multitude of years you shall increase its price, and
      according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price; for he
      sells to you according to the number of the years of the crops. '
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore you shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your God;\
      \ for I am the Lord your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ ‘So you shall observe My statutes and keep My judgments, and perform them;
      and you will dwell in the land in safety. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill, and dwell\
      \ there in safety. \n"
    20: '²⁰ ‘And if you say, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall
      not sow nor gather in our produce?” '
    21: '²¹ Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it will
      bring forth produce enough for three years. '
    22: "²² And you shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old produce until the ninth\
      \ year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat of the old harvest. \n"
    23: '²³ ‘The land shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you
      are strangers and sojourners with Me. '
    24: "²⁴ And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the\
      \ land. \n"
    25: '²⁵ ‘If one of your brethren becomes poor, and has sold some of his possession,
      and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it, then he may redeem what his
      brother sold. '
    26: '²⁶ Or if the man has no one to redeem it, but he himself becomes able to
      redeem it, '
    27: '²⁷ then let him count the years since its sale, and restore the remainder
      to the man to whom he sold it, that he may return to his possession. '
    28: "²⁸ But if he is not able to have it restored to himself, then what was sold\
      \ shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and\
      \ in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his possession.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ ‘If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within
      a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it. '
    30: '³⁰ But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house
      in the walled city shall belong permanently to him who bought it, throughout
      his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee. '
    31: '³¹ However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be
      counted as the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall be
      released in the Jubilee. '
    32: '³² Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, and the houses in the cities of
      their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time. '
    33: '³³ And if a man purchases a house from the Levites, then the house that was
      sold in the city of his possession shall be released in the Jubilee; for the
      houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children
      of Israel. '
    34: "³⁴ But the field of the common-land of their cities may not be sold, for\
      \ it is their perpetual possession. \n"
    35: '³⁵ ‘If one of your brethren becomes poor, and falls into poverty among you,
      then you shall help him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with
      you. '
    36: '³⁶ Take no usury or interest from him; but fear your God, that your brother
      may live with you. '
    37: '³⁷ You shall not lend him your money for usury, nor lend him your food at
      a profit. '
    38: "³⁸ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give\
      \ you the land of Canaan and to be your God. \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor, and sells
      himself to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a slave. '
    40: '⁴⁰ As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you, and shall serve
      you until the Year of Jubilee. '
    41: '⁴¹ And then he shall depart from you—he and his children with him—and shall
      return to his own family. He shall return to the possession of his fathers. '
    42: '⁴² For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they
      shall not be sold as slaves. '
    43: '⁴³ You shall not rule over him with rigor, but you shall fear your God. '
    44: '⁴⁴ And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have—from the nations
      that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Moreover you may buy the children of the strangers who dwell among you,
      and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land; and they
      shall become your property. '
    46: "⁴⁶ And you may take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to\
      \ inherit them as a possession; they shall be your permanent slaves. But regarding\
      \ your brethren, the children of Israel, you shall not rule over one another\
      \ with rigor. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ ‘Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich, and one of
      your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor, and sells himself to the stranger
      or sojourner close to you, or to a member of the stranger’s family, '
    48: '⁴⁸ after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem
      him; '
    49: '⁴⁹ or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him; or anyone who is near
      of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his release
      shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to
      him until the Year of Jubilee; it shall be according to the time of a hired
      servant for him. '
    51: '⁵¹ If there are still many years remaining, according to them he shall repay
      the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought. '
    52: '⁵² And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he
      shall reckon with him, and according to his years he shall repay him the price
      of his redemption. '
    53: '⁵³ He shall be with him as a yearly hired servant, and he shall not rule
      with rigor over him in your sight. '
    54: '⁵⁴ And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall be released in
      the Year of Jubilee—he and his children with him. '
    55: '⁵⁵ For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom
      I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.'

    46: ⁴⁶ These are the statutes and judgments and laws which the Lord made between
      Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
  27:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When a man consecrates
      by a vow certain persons to the Lord, according to your valuation, '
    3: '³ if your valuation is of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old,
      then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel
      of the sanctuary. '
    4: '⁴ If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels; '
    5: '⁵ and if from five years old up to twenty years old, then your valuation for
      a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels; '
    6: '⁶ and if from a month old up to five years old, then your valuation for a
      male shall be five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall
      be three shekels of silver; '
    7: "⁷ and if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then your valuation\
      \ shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. \n"
    8: "⁸ ‘But if he is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall present himself\
      \ before the priest, and the priest shall set a value for him; according to\
      \ the ability of him who vowed, the priest shall value him. \n"
    9: '⁹ ‘If it is an animal that men may bring as an offering to the Lord, all that
      anyone gives to the Lord shall be holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall not substitute it or exchange it, good for bad or bad for good;
      and if he at all exchanges animal for animal, then both it and the one exchanged
      for it shall be holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If it is an unclean animal which they do not offer as a sacrifice to the
      Lord, then he shall present the animal before the priest; '
    12: '¹² and the priest shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as
      you, the priest, value it, so it shall be. '
    13: "¹³ But if he wants at all to redeem it, then he must add one-fifth to your\
      \ valuation. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘And when a man dedicates his house to be holy to the Lord, then the priest
      shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as the priest values it,
      so it shall stand. '
    15: "¹⁵ If he who dedicated it wants to redeem his house, then he must add one-fifth\
      \ of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ ‘If a man dedicates to the Lord part of a field of his possession, then
      your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. A homer of barley seed
      shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. '
    17: '¹⁷ If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your
      valuation it shall stand. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall
      reckon to him the money due according to the years that remain till the Year
      of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation. '
    19: '¹⁹ And if he who dedicates the field ever wishes to redeem it, then he must
      add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall belong to him. '
    20: '²⁰ But if he does not want to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field
      to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore; '
    21: "²¹ but the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the\
      \ Lord, as a devoted field; it shall be the possession of the priest. \n"
    22: '²² ‘And if a man dedicates to the Lord a field which he has bought, which
      is not the field of his possession, '
    23: '²³ then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation, up to
      the Year of Jubilee, and he shall give your valuation on that day as a holy
      offering to the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was
      bought, to the one who owned the land as a possession. '
    25: "²⁵ And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary:\
      \ twenty gerahs to the shekel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ ‘But the firstborn of the animals, which should be the Lord’s firstborn,
      no man shall dedicate; whether it is an ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s. '
    27: "²⁷ And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your\
      \ valuation, and shall add one-fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed, then it\
      \ shall be sold according to your valuation. \n"
    28: '²⁸ ‘Nevertheless no devoted offering that a man may devote to the Lord of
      all that he has, both man and beast, or the field of his possession, shall be
      sold or redeemed; every devoted offering is most holy to the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ No person under the ban, who may become doomed to destruction among men,
      shall be redeemed, but shall surely be put to death. '
    30: '³⁰ And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the
      fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s. It is holy to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ If a man wants at all to redeem any of his tithes, he shall add one-fifth
      to it. '
    32: '³² And concerning the tithe of the herd or the flock, of whatever passes
      under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the Lord. '
    33: "³³ He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange\
      \ it; and if he exchanges it at all, then both it and the one exchanged for\
      \ it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.’ ” \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the children
      of Israel on Mount Sinai.
