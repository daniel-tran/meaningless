Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the
      Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel,
      Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. '
    2: '² It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. '
    3: '³ Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
      first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according
      to all that the Lord had given him as commandments to them, '
    4: "⁴ after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and\
      \ Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei. \n"
    5: '⁵ On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this
      law, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: ‘You have dwelt long enough
      at this mountain. '
    7: '⁷ Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to
      all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland,
      in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon,
      as far as the great river, the River Euphrates. '
    8: "⁸ See, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the\
      \ Lord swore to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—to give to them and\
      \ their descendants after them.’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “And I spoke to you at that time, saying: ‘I alone am not able to bear you. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as the stars
      of heaven in multitude. '
    11: '¹¹ May the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous
      than you are, and bless you as He has promised you! '
    12: '¹² How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints? '
    13: '¹³ Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes,
      and I will make them heads over you.’ '
    14: '¹⁴ And you answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have told us to do
      is good.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made\
      \ them heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of\
      \ fifties, leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between
      your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger
      who is with him. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as
      well as the great; you shall not be afraid in any man’s presence, for the judgment
      is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “So we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible
      wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as the
      Lord our God had commanded us. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea. '
    20: '²⁰ And I said to you, ‘You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which
      the Lord our God is giving us. '
    21: "²¹ Look, the Lord your God has set the land before you; go up and possess\
      \ it, as the Lord God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be discouraged.’\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “And every one of you came near to me and said, ‘Let us send men before\
      \ us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of\
      \ the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.’\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “The plan pleased me well; so I took twelve of your men, one man from
      each tribe. '
    24: '²⁴ And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley
      of Eshcol, and spied it out. '
    25: "²⁵ They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought\
      \ it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, ‘It is a good land\
      \ which the Lord our God is giving us.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of
      the Lord your God; '
    27: '²⁷ and you complained in your tents, and said, ‘Because the Lord hates us,
      He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the
      Amorites, to destroy us. '
    28: "²⁸ Where can we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our hearts, saying,\
      \ “The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified\
      \ up to heaven; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.” ’ \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, or afraid of them. '
    30: '³⁰ The Lord your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according
      to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, '
    31: '³¹ and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you,
      as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this
      place.’ '
    32: '³² Yet, for all that, you did not believe the Lord your God, '
    33: "³³ who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to pitch\
      \ your tents, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in\
      \ the cloud by day. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and took an
      oath, saying, '
    35: '³⁵ ‘Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good
      land of which I swore to give to your fathers, '
    36: '³⁶ except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his
      children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he wholly followed
      the Lord.’ '
    37: '³⁷ The Lord was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, ‘Even you shall
      not go in there. '
    38: "³⁸ Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage\
      \ him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. \n"
    39: '³⁹ ‘Moreover your little ones and your children, who you say will be victims,
      who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them
      I will give it, and they shall possess it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the\
      \ Way of the Red Sea.’ \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord; we\
      \ will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ And when everyone\
      \ of you had girded on his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the\
      \ mountain. \n"
    42: '⁴² “And the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am
      not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.” ’ '
    43: '⁴³ So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the
      command of the Lord, and presumptuously went up into the mountain. '
    44: '⁴⁴ And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased
      you as bees do, and drove you back from Seir to Hormah. '
    45: "⁴⁵ Then you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not listen\
      \ to your voice nor give ear to you. \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ “So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you spent
      there.
  2:
    1: "¹ “Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness of the Way of the Red\
      \ Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we skirted Mount Seir for many days. \n"
    2: '² “And the Lord spoke to me, saying: '
    3: '³ ‘You have skirted this mountain long enough; turn northward. '
    4: '⁴ And command the people, saying, “You are about to pass through the territory
      of your brethren, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be
      afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully. '
    5: '⁵ Do not meddle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no,
      not so much as one footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. '
    6: "⁶ You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall\
      \ also buy water from them with money, that you may drink. \n"
    7: "⁷ “For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He\
      \ knows your trudging through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord\
      \ your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.” ’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “And when we passed beyond our brethren, the descendants of Esau who dwell
      in Seir, away from the road of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we
      turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab. '
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in\
      \ battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because\
      \ I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’ ” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ (The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous
      and tall as the Anakim. '
    11: '¹¹ They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call
      them Emim. '
    12: "¹² The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed\
      \ them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as\
      \ Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave them.) \n"
    13: '¹³ “ ‘Now rise and cross over the Valley of the Zered.’ So we crossed over
      the Valley of the Zered. '
    14: '¹⁴ And the time we took to come from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over
      the Valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of
      the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, just as the Lord had
      sworn to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from\
      \ the midst of the camp until they were consumed. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “So it was, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the
      people, '
    17: '¹⁷ that the Lord spoke to me, saying: '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘This day you are to cross over at Ar, the boundary of Moab. '
    19: "¹⁹ And when you come near the people of Ammon, do not harass them or meddle\
      \ with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon\
      \ as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’\
      \ ” \n"
    20: '²⁰ (That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there.
      But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, '
    21: '²¹ a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed
      them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, '
    22: '²² just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when
      He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt
      in their place, even to this day. '
    23: "²³ And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza—the Caphtorim, who\
      \ came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.) \n"
    24: '²⁴ “ ‘Rise, take your journey, and cross over the River Arnon. Look, I have
      given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin
      to possess it, and engage him in battle. '
    25: "²⁵ This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations\
      \ under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble\
      \ and be in anguish because of you.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “And I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of
      Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ ‘Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the road, and
      I will turn neither to the right nor to the left. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for
      money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot, '
    29: "²⁹ just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who\
      \ dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord\
      \ our God is giving us.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the Lord\
      \ your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver\
      \ him into your hand, as it is this day. \n"
    31: '³¹ “And the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land
      over to you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.’ '
    32: '³² Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz. '
    33: '³³ And the Lord our God delivered him over to us; so we defeated him, his
      sons, and all his people. '
    34: '³⁴ We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men,
      women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining. '
    35: '³⁵ We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoil of
      the cities which we took. '
    36: '³⁶ From Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, and from the city
      that is in the ravine, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for
      us; the Lord our God delivered all to us. '
    37: ³⁷ Only you did not go near the land of the people of Ammon—anywhere along
      the River Jabbok, or to the cities of the mountains, or wherever the Lord our
      God had forbidden us.
  3:
    1: '¹ “Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came
      out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. '
    2: "² And the Lord said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and\
      \ all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did\
      \ to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’ \n"
    3: '³ “So the Lord our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with
      all his people, and we attacked him until he had no survivors remaining. '
    4: '⁴ And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did
      not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og
      in Bashan. '
    5: '⁵ All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides
      a great many rural towns. '
    6: '⁶ And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly
      destroying the men, women, and children of every city. '
    7: "⁷ But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the
      Amorites who were on this side of the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount
      Hermon '
    9: '⁹ (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir), '
    10: "¹⁰ all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah\
      \ and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Indeed\
      \ his bedstead was an iron bedstead. (Is it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon?)\
      \ Nine cubits is its length and four cubits its width, according to the standard\
      \ cubit. \n"
    12: '¹² “And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is
      by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave
      to the Reubenites and the Gadites. '
    13: '¹³ The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half
      the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called
      the land of the giants. '
    14: "¹⁴ Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border\
      \ of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name,\
      \ Havoth Jair, to this day.) \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Also I gave Gilead to Machir. '
    16: '¹⁶ And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the
      River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok,
      the border of the people of Ammon; '
    17: "¹⁷ the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far\
      \ as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes\
      \ of Pisgah. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The Lord your God has given
      you this land to possess. All you men of valor shall cross over armed before
      your brethren, the children of Israel. '
    19: '¹⁹ But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you
      have much livestock) shall stay in your cities which I have given you, '
    20: "²⁰ until the Lord has given rest to your brethren as to you, and they also\
      \ possess the land which the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan.\
      \ Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’ \n"
    21: '²¹ “And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen all
      that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so will the Lord do to all
      the kingdoms through which you pass. '
    22: "²² You must not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself fights for you.’\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “Then I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying: '
    24: '²⁴ ‘O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your
      mighty hand, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do anything
      like Your works and Your mighty deeds? '
    25: "²⁵ I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those\
      \ pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But the Lord was angry with me on your account, and would not listen
      to me. So the Lord said to me: ‘Enough of that! Speak no more to Me of this
      matter. '
    27: '²⁷ Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north,
      the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over
      this Jordan. '
    28: "²⁸ But command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall\
      \ go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which\
      \ you will see.’ \n"
    29: ²⁹ “So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ “Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I teach you
      to observe, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord
      God of your fathers is giving you. '
    2: '² You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that
      you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. '
    3: '³ Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor; for the Lord your God
      has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor. '
    4: "⁴ But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of\
      \ you. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God
      commanded me, that you should act according to them in the land which you go
      to possess. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore be careful to observe them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding\
      \ in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, ‘Surely\
      \ this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the Lord
      our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him? '
    8: '⁸ And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments
      as are in all this law which I set before you this day? '
    9: '⁹ Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget
      the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the
      days of your life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren, '
    10: "¹⁰ especially concerning the day you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb,\
      \ when the Lord said to me, ‘Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear\
      \ My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth,\
      \ and that they may teach their children.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain
      burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. '
    12: '¹² And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the
      sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice. '
    13: '¹³ So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform,
      the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments,\
      \ that you might observe them in the land which you cross over to possess. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Take careful heed to yourselves, for you saw no form when the Lord spoke
      to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, '
    16: '¹⁶ lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form
      of any figure: the likeness of male or female, '
    17: '¹⁷ the likeness of any animal that is on the earth or the likeness of any
      winged bird that flies in the air, '
    18: '¹⁸ the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of
      any fish that is in the water beneath the earth. '
    19: '¹⁹ And take heed, lest you lift your eyes to heaven, and when you see the
      sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, you feel driven to worship
      them and serve them, which the Lord your God has given to all the peoples under
      the whole heaven as a heritage. '
    20: '²⁰ But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out
      of Egypt, to be His people, an inheritance, as you are this day. '
    21: '²¹ Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that
      I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land
      which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. '
    22: '²² But I must die in this land, I must not cross over the Jordan; but you
      shall cross over and possess that good land. '
    23: '²³ Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your
      God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form
      of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you. '
    24: "²⁴ For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “When you beget children and grandchildren and have grown old in the land,
      and act corruptly and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do evil
      in the sight of the Lord your God to provoke Him to anger, '
    26: '²⁶ I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will
      soon utterly perish from the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess;
      you will not prolong your days in it, but will be utterly destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left
      few in number among the nations where the Lord will drive you. '
    28: '²⁸ And there you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone,
      which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. '
    29: '²⁹ But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find Him
      if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul. '
    30: '³⁰ When you are in distress, and all these things come upon you in the latter
      days, when you turn to the Lord your God and obey His voice '
    31: "³¹ (for the Lord your God is a merciful God), He will not forsake you nor\
      \ destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² “For ask now concerning the days that are past, which were before you,
      since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven
      to the other, whether any great thing like this has happened, or anything like
      it has been heard. '
    33: '³³ Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of
      the fire, as you have heard, and live? '
    34: '³⁴ Or did God ever try to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst
      of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand
      and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord
      your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? '
    35: '³⁵ To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord Himself is God;
      there is none other besides Him. '
    36: '³⁶ Out of heaven He let you hear His voice, that He might instruct you; on
      earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst
      of the fire. '
    37: '³⁷ And because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants
      after them; and He brought you out of Egypt with His Presence, with His mighty
      power, '
    38: '³⁸ driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to
      bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day. '
    39: '³⁹ Therefore know this day, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord
      Himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. '
    40: "⁴⁰ You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I command\
      \ you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you,\
      \ and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord your God is\
      \ giving you for all time.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the
      rising of the sun, '
    42: '⁴² that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally,
      without having hated him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities
      he might live: '
    43: "⁴³ Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead\
      \ for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Now this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. '
    45: '⁴⁵ These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Moses
      spoke to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt, '
    46: '⁴⁶ on this side of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land
      of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children
      of Israel defeated after they came out of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan,
      two kings of the Amorites, who were on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising

    48: '⁴⁸ from Aroer, which is on the bank of the River Arnon, even to Mount Sion
      (that is, Hermon), '
    49: ⁴⁹ and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the
      Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
  5:
    1: '¹ And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the statutes

    2: '² The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. '
    3: '³ The Lord did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, those
      who are here today, all of us who are alive. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of
      the fire. '
    5: "⁵ I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word\
      \ of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up\
      \ the mountain. He said: \n"
    6: "⁶ ‘I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of\
      \ the house of bondage. \n"
    7: "⁷ ‘You shall have no other gods before Me. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything
      that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
      water under the earth; '
    9: '⁹ you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God,
      am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to
      the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, '
    10: "¹⁰ but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ ‘You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord\
      \ will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. \n"
    12: '¹² ‘Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded
      you. '
    13: '¹³ Six days you shall labor and do all your work, '
    14: '¹⁴ but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall
      do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor
      your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor
      your stranger who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female
      servant may rest as well as you. '
    15: "¹⁵ And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord\
      \ your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched\
      \ arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded\
      \ you, that your days may be long, and that it may be well with you in the land\

    18: "¹⁸ ‘You shall not commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ ‘You shall not steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ ‘You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ ‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife; and you shall not desire your\

    22: "²² “These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly, in the mountain from\
      \ the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice;\
      \ and He added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them\
      \ to me. \n"
    23: '²³ “So it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while
      the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads
      of your tribes and your elders. '
    24: '²⁴ And you said: ‘Surely the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His
      greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen
      this day that God speaks with man; yet he still lives. '
    25: '²⁵ Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us;
      if we hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore, then we shall die. '
    26: '²⁶ For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God
      speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? '
    27: "²⁷ You go near and hear all that the Lord our God may say, and tell us all\

    29: '²⁹ Oh, that they had such a heart in them that they would fear Me and always
      keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and with their children
      forever! '
    30: '³⁰ Go and say to them, “Return to your tents.” '
    31: "³¹ But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments,\

    32: '³² “Therefore you shall be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded
      you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. '
    33: ³³ You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has commanded you,
      that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong
      your days in the land which you shall possess.
  6:
    1: '¹ “Now this is the commandment, and these are the statutes and judgments which

    4: '⁴ “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! '
    5: "⁵ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul,\
      \ and with all your strength. \n"
    6: '⁶ “And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. '
    7: '⁷ You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them
      when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and
      when you rise up. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets
      between your eyes. '
    9: "⁹ You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “So it shall be, when the Lord your God brings you into the land of which

      which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant—when
      you have eaten and are full— '
    12: '¹² then beware, lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land
      of Egypt, from the house of bondage. '
    13: '¹³ You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him, and shall take oaths in
      His name. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all
      around you '

    16: '¹⁶ “You shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted Him in Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, His testimonies,
      and His statutes which He has commanded you. '
    18: '¹⁸ And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that
      it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land of

    20: '²⁰ “When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is the meaning
      of the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which the Lord our God has
      commanded you?’ '
    21: '²¹ then you shall say to your son: ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and
      the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; '
    22: '²² and the Lord showed signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe,
      against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household. '
    23: '²³ Then He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give
      us the land of which He swore to our fathers. '
    24: '²⁴ And the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord
      our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is this
      day. '
    25: ²⁵ Then it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to observe all
      these commandments before the Lord our God, as He has commanded us.’
  7:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you go to possess,
      and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and
      the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites,
      seven nations greater and mightier than you, '
    2: '² and when the Lord your God delivers them over to you, you shall conquer
      them and utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show
      mercy to them. '
    3: '³ Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter
      to their son, nor take their daughter for your son. '
    4: '⁴ For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods;
      so the anger of the Lord will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly. '
    5: "⁵ But thus you shall deal with them: you shall destroy their altars, and break\

      \ carved images with fire. \n"
    6: '⁶ “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen
      you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on
      the face of the earth. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more
      in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples; '
    8: "⁸ but because the Lord loves you, and because He would keep the oath which\
      \ He swore to your fathers, the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand,\
      \ and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king\

    9: '⁹ “Therefore know that the Lord your God, He is God, the faithful God who
      keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him
      and keep His commandments; '

      the land of which He swore to your fathers to give you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be a male or female
      barren among you or among your livestock. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you
      with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay
      them on all those who hate you. '
    16: "¹⁶ Also you shall destroy all the peoples whom the Lord your God delivers\
      \ over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their\

    17: '¹⁷ “If you should say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I; how
      can I dispossess them?’— '
    18: '¹⁸ you shall not be afraid of them, but you shall remember well what the
      Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: '
    19: '¹⁹ the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs and the wonders, the mighty
      hand and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out. So
      shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. '
    20: '²⁰ Moreover the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until those
      who are left, who hide themselves from you, are destroyed. '
    21: '²¹ You shall not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God, the great and
      awesome God, is among you. '
    22: '²² And the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you little by
      little; you will be unable to destroy them at once, lest the beasts of the field
      become too numerous for you. '
    23: '²³ But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, and will inflict
      defeat upon them until they are destroyed. '
    24: '²⁴ And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will destroy their
      name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand against you until you
      have destroyed them. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not
      covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you
      be snared by it; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. '
    26: ²⁶ Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed
      to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for
      it is an accursed thing.
  8:
    1: '¹ “Every commandment which I command you today you must be careful to observe,

      forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was
      in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. '
    3: '³ So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you

      the mouth of the Lord. '

      of water, of fountains and springs, that flow out of valleys and hills; '
    8: '⁸ a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land
      of olive oil and honey; '
    9: '⁹ a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack
      nothing; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper. '
    10: "¹⁰ When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the Lord your God\
      \ for the good land which He has given you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments,

      and dwell in them; '

      you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; '
    15: '¹⁵ who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, in which were
      fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land where there was no water; who
      brought water for you out of the flinty rock; '
    16: '¹⁶ who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know,
      that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do you good in the end— '
    17: "¹⁷ then you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gained\

    18: '¹⁸ “And you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you
      power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your
      fathers, as it is this day. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then it shall be, if you by any means forget the Lord your God, and follow
      other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day
      that you shall surely perish. '
    20: ²⁰ As the nations which the Lord destroys before you, so you shall perish,

  9:
    1: '¹ “Hear, O Israel: You are to cross over the Jordan today, and go in to dispossess

    4: '⁴ “Do not think in your heart, after the Lord your God has cast them out before

      is driving them out from before you. '
    5: '⁵ It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart
      that you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these

      and Jacob. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore understand that the Lord your God is not giving you this good\

    7: '⁷ “Remember! Do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in
      the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until
      you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Also in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry
      enough with you to have destroyed you. '
    9: '⁹ When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets
      of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I stayed on the mountain
      forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger
      of God, and on them were all the words which the Lord had spoken to you on the
      mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. '
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the\
      \ Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. \n"
    12: "¹² “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your\

      \ turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves\
      \ a molded image.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “Furthermore the Lord spoke to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and
      indeed they are a stiff-necked people. '
    14: "¹⁴ Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under\
      \ heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned
      with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God—had
      made for yourselves a molded calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way
      which the Lord had commanded you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke
      them before your eyes. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty
      nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you
      committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord
      was angry with you, to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me at that time
      also. '
    20: '²⁰ And the Lord was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him; so
      I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. '
    21: "²¹ Then I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with\
      \ fire and crushed it and ground it very small, until it was as fine as dust;\
      \ and I threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain. \n"
    22: '²² “Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the Lord
      to wrath. '
    23: '²³ Likewise, when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, ‘Go up and
      possess the land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the commandment
      of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice. '
    24: "²⁴ You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Thus I prostrated myself before the Lord; forty days and forty nights
      I kept prostrating myself, because the Lord had said He would destroy you. '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore I prayed to the Lord, and said: ‘O Lord God, do not destroy
      Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness,
      whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    27: '²⁷ Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the
      stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin, '
    28: '²⁸ lest the land from which You brought us should say, “Because the Lord
      was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He
      hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.” '
    29: ²⁹ Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by
      Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.’
  10:
    1: '¹ “At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Hew for yourself two tablets of stone
      like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of
      wood. '
    2: "² And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets,\
      \ which you broke; and you shall put them in the ark.’ \n"
    3: '³ “So I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first,
      and went up the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. '
    4: '⁴ And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments,
      which the Lord had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire
      in the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me. '
    5: "⁵ Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the\
      \ ark which I had made; and there they are, just as the Lord commanded me.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ (Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah,
      where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered as
      priest in his stead. '
    7: '⁷ From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a
      land of rivers of water. '
    8: '⁸ At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the
      covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless
      in His name, to this day. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord\
      \ is his inheritance, just as the Lord your God promised him.) \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “As at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights;
      the Lord also heard me at that time, and the Lord chose not to destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, begin your journey before the people,\
      \ that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to\
      \ give them.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear
      the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve the Lord
      your God with all your heart and with all your soul, '
    13: '¹³ and to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command
      you today for your good? '
    14: '¹⁴ Indeed heaven and the highest heavens belong to the Lord your God, also
      the earth with all that is in it. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord delighted only in your fathers, to love them; and He chose their
      descendants after them, you above all peoples, as it is this day. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no
      longer. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God,
      mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe. '
    18: '¹⁸ He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the
      stranger, giving him food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him, and to Him you
      shall hold fast, and take oaths in His name. '
    21: '²¹ He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you these great
      and awesome things which your eyes have seen. '
    22: ²² Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons, and now the Lord
      your God has made you as the stars of heaven in multitude.
  11:
    1: '¹ “Therefore you shall love the Lord your God, and keep His charge, His statutes,
      His judgments, and His commandments always. '
    2: '² Know today that I do not speak with your children, who have not known and
      who have not seen the chastening of the Lord your God, His greatness and His
      mighty hand and His outstretched arm— '
    3: '³ His signs and His acts which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king
      of Egypt, and to all his land; '
    4: '⁴ what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: how
      He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and how
      the Lord has destroyed them to this day; '
    5: '⁵ what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place; '
    6: '⁶ and what He did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben:
      how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their households, their
      tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
      Israel— '
    7: "⁷ but your eyes have seen every great act of the Lord which He did. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I command you today, that
      you may be strong, and go in and possess the land which you cross over to possess, '
    9: '⁹ and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swore to give
      your fathers, to them and their descendants, ‘a land flowing with milk and honey.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ For the land which you go to possess is not like the land of Egypt from
      which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot, as a
      vegetable garden; '
    11: '¹¹ but the land which you cross over to possess is a land of hills and valleys,
      which drinks water from the rain of heaven, '
    12: "¹² a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God\
      \ are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ ‘And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command
      you today, to love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with
      all your soul, '
    14: '¹⁴ then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain
      and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your
      oil. '
    15: '¹⁵ And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may
      eat and be filled.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside
      and serve other gods and worship them, '
    17: "¹⁷ lest the Lord’s anger be aroused against you, and He shut up the heavens\
      \ so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly\
      \ from the good land which the Lord is giving you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your
      soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between
      your eyes. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in
      your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. '
    20: '²⁰ And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, '
    21: "²¹ that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the\
      \ land of which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, like the days of\
      \ the heavens above the earth. \n"
    22: '²² “For if you carefully keep all these commandments which I command you
      to do—to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to
      Him— '
    23: '²³ then the Lord will drive out all these nations from before you, and you
      will dispossess greater and mightier nations than yourselves. '
    24: '²⁴ Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from
      the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the
      Western Sea, shall be your territory. '
    25: "²⁵ No man shall be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put\
      \ the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, just\
      \ as He has said to you. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: '
    27: '²⁷ the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which
      I command you today; '
    28: '²⁸ and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God,
      but turn aside from the way which I command you today, to go after other gods
      which you have not known. '
    29: '²⁹ Now it shall be, when the Lord your God has brought you into the land
      which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and
      the curse on Mount Ebal. '
    30: '³⁰ Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun,
      in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside
      the terebinth trees of Moreh? '
    31: '³¹ For you will cross over the Jordan and go in to possess the land which
      the Lord your God is giving you, and you will possess it and dwell in it. '
    32: ³² And you shall be careful to observe all the statutes and judgments which
      I set before you today.
  12:
    1: '¹ “These are the statutes and judgments which you shall be careful to observe
      in the land which the Lord God of your fathers is giving you to possess, all
      the days that you live on the earth. '
    2: '² You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you shall
      dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under
      every green tree. '
    3: '³ And you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and burn
      their wooden images with fire; you shall cut down the carved images of their
      gods and destroy their names from that place. '
    4: "⁴ You shall not worship the Lord your God with such things. \n"
    5: '⁵ “But you shall seek the place where the Lord your God chooses, out of all
      your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go. '
    6: '⁶ There you shall take your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes,
      the heave offerings of your hand, your vowed offerings, your freewill offerings,
      and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. '
    7: "⁷ And there you shall eat before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice\

    8: '⁸ “You shall not at all do as we are doing here today—every man doing whatever
      is right in his own eyes— '
    9: '⁹ for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which the Lord
      your God is giving you. '
    10: '¹⁰ But when you cross over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord
      your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies
      round about, so that you dwell in safety, '
    11: '¹¹ then there will be the place where the Lord your God chooses to make His
      name abide. There you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings,
      your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, and all your
      choice offerings which you vow to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your sons and
      your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within
      your gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you. '
    13: '¹³ Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every
      place that you see; '
    14: "¹⁴ but in the place which the Lord chooses, in one of your tribes, there\
      \ you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command\
      \ you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within all your gates, whatever
      your heart desires, according to the blessing of the Lord your God which He
      has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the
      deer alike. '
    16: '¹⁶ Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like
      water. '
    17: '¹⁷ You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or your new
      wine or your oil, of the firstborn of your herd or your flock, of any of your
      offerings which you vow, of your freewill offerings, or of the heave offering
      of your hand. '
    18: '¹⁸ But you must eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the
      Lord your God chooses, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant
      and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall
      rejoice before the Lord your God in all to which you put your hands. '
    19: "¹⁹ Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you\

    20: '²⁰ “When the Lord your God enlarges your border as He has promised you, and
      you say, ‘Let me eat meat,’ because you long to eat meat, you may eat as much
      meat as your heart desires. '
    21: '²¹ If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put His name is too far
      from you, then you may slaughter from your herd and from your flock which the
      Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you, and you may eat within your
      gates as much as your heart desires. '
    22: '²² Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you may eat them; the unclean
      and the clean alike may eat them. '
    23: '²³ Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life;
      you may not eat the life with the meat. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth like water. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and your children after
      you, when you do what is right in the sight of the Lord. '
    26: '²⁶ Only the holy things which you have, and your vowed offerings, you shall
      take and go to the place which the Lord chooses. '
    27: '²⁷ And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the
      altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured
      out on the altar of the Lord your God, and you shall eat the meat. '
    28: "²⁸ Observe and obey all these words which I command you, that it may go well\
      \ with you and your children after you forever, when you do what is good and\
      \ right in the sight of the Lord your God. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When the Lord your God cuts off from before you the nations which you
      go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land, '
    30: '³⁰ take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after
      they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their
      gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.’ '
    31: "³¹ You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way; for every abomination\

    32: ³² “Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to

      God with all your heart and with all your soul. '
    4: '⁴ You shall walk after the Lord your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments
      and obey His voice; you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him. '

    14: '¹⁴ every raven after its kind; '
    15: '¹⁵ the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after their
      kinds; '

    22: '²² “You shall truly tithe all the increase of your grain that the field produces

      the tithe, or if the place where the Lord your God chooses to put His name is
      too far from you, when the Lord your God has blessed you, '
    25: '²⁵ then you shall exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and
      go to the place which the Lord your God chooses. '
    26: '²⁶ And you shall spend that money for whatever your heart desires: for oxen
      or sheep, for wine or similar drink, for whatever your heart desires; you shall
      eat there before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household. '
    27: "²⁷ You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has\
      \ no part nor inheritance with you. \n"
    28: '²⁸ “At the end of every third year you shall bring out the tithe of your
      produce of that year and store it up within your gates. '
    29: ²⁹ And the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and

      his brother, because it is called the Lord’s release. '
    3: '³ Of a foreigner you may require it; but you shall give up your claim to what
      is owed by your brother, '
    4: '⁴ except when there may be no poor among you; for the Lord will greatly bless
      you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance— '
    5: '⁵ only if you carefully obey the voice of the Lord your God, to observe with
      care all these commandments which I command you today. '
    6: "⁶ For the Lord your God will bless you just as He promised you; you shall\
      \ lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall reign over many\
      \ nations, but they shall not reign over you. \n"
    7: '⁷ “If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates
      in your land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your
      heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, '
    8: '⁸ but you shall open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient
      for his need, whatever he needs. '
    9: '⁹ Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh
      year, the year of release, is at hand,’ and your eye be evil against your poor
      brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the Lord against you, and
      it become sin among you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when
      you give to him, because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in
      all your works and in all to which you put your hand. '
    11: "¹¹ For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you,\
      \ saying, ‘You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your\
      \ needy, in your land.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and
      serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from
      you. '
    13: '¹³ And when you send him away free from you, you shall not let him go away
      empty-handed; '
    14: '¹⁴ you shall supply him liberally from your flock, from your threshing floor,
      and from your winepress. From what the Lord your God has blessed you with, you
      shall give to him. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the
      Lord your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today. '
    16: '¹⁶ And if it happens that he says to you, ‘I will not go away from you,’
      because he loves you and your house, since he prospers with you, '
    17: '¹⁷ then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door,
      and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall
      do likewise. '
    18: "¹⁸ It shall not seem hard to you when you send him away free from you; for\
      \ he has been worth a double hired servant in serving you six years. Then the\
      \ Lord your God will bless you in all that you do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “All the firstborn males that come from your herd and your flock you shall
      sanctify to the Lord your God; you shall do no work with the firstborn of your
      herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. '
    20: '²⁰ You and your household shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year
      in the place which the Lord chooses. '
    21: '²¹ But if there is a defect in it, if it is lame or blind or has any serious
      defect, you shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. '
    22: '²² You may eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean person alike
      may eat it, as if it were a gazelle or a deer. '
    23: ²³ Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like
      water.
  16:
    1: '¹ “Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to the Lord your God,
      for in the month of Abib the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² Therefore you shall sacrifice the Passover to the Lord your God, from the
      flock and the herd, in the place where the Lord chooses to put His name. '
    3: '³ You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened
      bread with it, that is, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land
      of Egypt in haste), that you may remember the day in which you came out of the
      land of Egypt all the days of your life. '
    4: "⁴ And no leaven shall be seen among you in all your territory for seven days,\

      there you shall sacrifice the Passover at twilight, at the going down of the
      sun, at the time you came out of Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the Lord your God chooses,
      and in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents. '
    8: "⁸ Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall\
      \ be a sacred assembly to the Lord your God. You shall do no work on it. \n"
    9: '⁹ “You shall count seven weeks for yourself; begin to count the seven weeks
      from the time you begin to put the sickle to the grain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then you shall keep the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God with the tribute
      of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give as the Lord your
      God blesses you. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your son and your
      daughter, your male servant and your female servant, the Levite who is within
      your gates, the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are among you,

    12: "¹² And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall be\

      gathered from your threshing floor and from your winepress. '
    14: '¹⁴ And you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter,

      of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles; and they shall not appear before
      the Lord empty-handed. '
    17: "¹⁷ Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord\

      with just judgment. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall not pervert justice; you shall not show partiality, nor take
      a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the
      righteous. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall follow what is altogether just, that you may live and inherit\

      God gives you, a man or a woman who has been wicked in the sight of the Lord
      your God, in transgressing His covenant, '

      moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded, '
    4: '⁴ and it is told you, and you hear of it, then you shall inquire diligently.
      And if it is indeed true and certain that such an abomination has been committed
      in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has committed
      that wicked thing, and shall stone to death that man or woman with stones. '
    6: '⁶ Whoever is deserving of death shall be put to death on the testimony of
      two or three witnesses; he shall not be put to death on the testimony of one
      witness. '
    7: "⁷ The hands of the witnesses shall be the first against him to put him to\

    8: '⁸ “If a matter arises which is too hard for you to judge, between degrees
      of guilt for bloodshed, between one judgment or another, or between one punishment
      or another, matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise and
      go up to the place which the Lord your God chooses. '
    9: '⁹ And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge there in
      those days, and inquire of them; they shall pronounce upon you the sentence
      of judgment. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall do according to the sentence which they pronounce upon you in
      that place which the Lord chooses. And you shall be careful to do according
      to all that they order you. '
    11: '¹¹ According to the sentence of the law in which they instruct you, according
      to the judgment which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside
      to the right hand or to the left from the sentence which they pronounce upon
      you. '
    12: '¹² Now the man who acts presumptuously and will not heed the priest who stands
      to minister there before the Lord your God, or the judge, that man shall die.

    15: '¹⁵ you shall surely set a king over you whom the Lord your God chooses; one
      from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you may not set a foreigner
      over you, who is not your brother. '
    16: '¹⁶ But he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to
      return to Egypt to multiply horses, for the Lord has said to you, ‘You shall
      not return that way again.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away;\

    18: '¹⁸ “Also it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he
      shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book, from the one before the
      priests, the Levites. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life,
      that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and be careful to observe all the
      words of this law and these statutes, '
    20: ²⁰ that his heart may not be lifted above his brethren, that he may not turn
      aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left, and that he may

  18:
    1: '¹ “The priests, the Levites—all the tribe of Levi—shall have no part nor inheritance
      with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and His
      portion. '
    2: "² Therefore they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the Lord\

    3: '³ “And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from those who offer
      a sacrifice, whether it is bull or sheep: they shall give to the priest the
      shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach. '
    4: '⁴ The firstfruits of your grain and your new wine and your oil, and the first
      of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. '
    5: "⁵ For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to\

    6: '⁶ “So if a Levite comes from any of your gates, from where he dwells among
      all Israel, and comes with all the desire of his mind to the place which the
      Lord chooses, '
    7: '⁷ then he may serve in the name of the Lord his God as all his brethren the
      Levites do, who stand there before the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ They shall have equal portions to eat, besides what comes from the sale\
      \ of his inheritance. \n"
    9: '⁹ “When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you
      shall not learn to follow the abominations of those nations. '
    10: '¹⁰ There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter
      pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or
      one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, '
    11: '¹¹ or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls
      up the dead. '
    12: '¹² For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because
      of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall be blameless before the Lord your God. '
    14: "¹⁴ For these nations which you will dispossess listened to soothsayers and\

    15: '¹⁵ “The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst,

    17: '¹⁷ “And the Lord said to me: ‘What they have spoken is good. '

      and will put My words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command
      Him. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which He speaks in
      My name, I will require it of him. '
    20: '²⁰ But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name, which I have
      not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet
      shall die.’ '
    21: '²¹ And if you say in your heart, ‘How shall we know the word which the Lord
      has not spoken?’— '
    22: ²² when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing does not happen
      or come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken; the prophet
      has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.
  19:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God has cut off the nations whose land the Lord your
      God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in
      their houses, '
    2: '² you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which
      the Lord your God is giving you to possess. '
    3: "³ You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory\
      \ of your land which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer\
      \ may flee there. \n"
    4: '⁴ “And this is the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live:
      Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, not having hated him in time past— '
    5: '⁵ as when a man goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut timber, and his
      hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from
      the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of
      these cities and live; '
    6: '⁶ lest the avenger of blood, while his anger is hot, pursue the manslayer
      and overtake him, because the way is long, and kill him, though he was not deserving
      of death, since he had not hated the victim in time past. '
    7: "⁷ Therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall separate three cities for yourself.’\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Now if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers,
      and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers, '
    9: '⁹ and if you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you
      today, to love the Lord your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall
      add three more cities for yourself besides these three, '
    10: "¹⁰ lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the Lord your\

      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “But if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises against
      him and strikes him mortally, so that he dies, and he flees to one of these
      cities, '
    12: '¹² then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver
      him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. '
    13: "¹³ Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent\
      \ blood from Israel, that it may go well with you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which the men of old have\
      \ set, in your inheritance which you will inherit in the land that the Lord\
      \ your God is giving you to possess. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any
      sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall
      be established. '
    16: '¹⁶ If a false witness rises against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, '
    17: '¹⁷ then both men in the controversy shall stand before the Lord, before the
      priests and the judges who serve in those days. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the judges shall make careful inquiry, and indeed, if the witness
      is a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother, '
    19: '¹⁹ then you shall do to him as he thought to have done to his brother; so
      you shall put away the evil from among you. '
    20: '²⁰ And those who remain shall hear and fear, and hereafter they shall not
      again commit such evil among you. '
    21: '²¹ Your eye shall not pity: life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for
      tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.'
  20:
    1: '¹ “When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots
      and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the Lord your
      God is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. '
    2: '² So it shall be, when you are on the verge of battle, that the priest shall
      approach and speak to the people. '
    3: '³ And he shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel: Today you are on the verge of
      battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and
      do not tremble or be terrified because of them; '
    4: "⁴ for the Lord your God is He who goes with you, to fight for you against\
      \ your enemies, to save you.’ \n"
    5: '⁵ “Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying: ‘What man is there
      who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to
      his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. '
    6: '⁶ Also what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it?
      Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man
      eat of it. '
    7: "⁷ And what man is there who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her?\
      \ Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another\
      \ man marry her.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “The officers shall speak further to the people, and say, ‘What man is there
      who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest the
      heart of his brethren faint like his heart.’ '
    9: "⁹ And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people,\

    10: '¹⁰ “When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of
      peace to it. '
    11: '¹¹ And it shall be that if they accept your offer of peace, and open to you,
      then all the people who are found in it shall be placed under tribute to you,
      and serve you. '
    12: '¹² Now if the city will not make peace with you, but war against you, then
      you shall besiege it. '
    13: '¹³ And when the Lord your God delivers it into your hands, you shall strike
      every male in it with the edge of the sword. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the
      city, all its spoil, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the enemies’
      plunder which the Lord your God gives you. '

      \ are not of the cities of these nations. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you
      as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive, '

      Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the Lord
      your God has commanded you, '
    18: "¹⁸ lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they\

    19: '¹⁹ “When you besiege a city for a long time, while making war against it
      to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them;
      if you can eat of them, do not cut them down to use in the siege, for the tree
      of the field is man’s food. '
    20: ²⁰ Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and
      cut down, to build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until
      it is subdued.
  21:
    1: '¹ “If anyone is found slain, lying in the field in the land which the Lord
      your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him, '
    2: '² then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from
      the slain man to the surrounding cities. '
    3: '³ And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will
      take a heifer which has not been worked and which has not pulled with a yoke. '
    4: '⁴ The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing
      water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer’s neck
      there in the valley. '
    5: '⁵ Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the Lord your God
      has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the Lord; by
      their word every controversy and every assault shall be settled. '
    6: '⁶ And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their
      hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. '
    7: '⁷ Then they shall answer and say, ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, nor
      have our eyes seen it. '
    8: '⁸ Provide atonement, O Lord, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed,
      and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel.’ And atonement
      shall be provided on their behalf for the blood. '
    9: "⁹ So you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when you\

      and trim her nails. '
    13: '¹³ She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house,

    25: '²⁵ Then people would say: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the

      your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess. '
    19: '¹⁹ I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set
      before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that

    1: '¹ Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. '

      over this Jordan.’ '
    3: '³ The Lord your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these

    7: '⁷ Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be
      strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which
      the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to
      inherit it. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He\

    9: '⁹ So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi,
      who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ And Moses commanded them, saying: “At the end of every seven years, at
      the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles, '
    11: '¹¹ when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place
      which He chooses, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. '
    12: '¹² Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger
      who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear
      the Lord your God and carefully observe all the words of this law, '
    13: "¹³ and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to\
      \ fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the\
      \ Jordan to possess.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, the days approach when you must\
      \ die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that\
      \ I may inaugurate him.”\nSo Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves\
      \ in the tabernacle of meeting. "
    15: "¹⁵ Now the Lord appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the\
      \ pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And the Lord said to Moses: “Behold, you will rest with your fathers;
      and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners
      of the land, where they go to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break
      My covenant which I have made with them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then My anger shall be aroused against them in that day, and I will forsake
      them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many
      evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Have
      not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’ '
    18: "¹⁸ And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which\
      \ they have done, in that they have turned to other gods. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the
      children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness
      for Me against the children of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which
      I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown
      fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke
      Me and break My covenant. '
    21: "²¹ Then it shall be, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that\
      \ this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten\
      \ in the mouths of their descendants, for I know the inclination of their behavior\
      \ today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore to give\
      \ them.” \n"
    22: '²² Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children
      of Israel. '
    23: "²³ Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and of\
      \ good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of\
      \ which I swore to them, and I will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a
      book, when they were finished, '
    25: '²⁵ that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord, saying: '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this Book of the Law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord your God, that it may be there as a witness against you; '
    27: '²⁷ for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet
      alive with you, you have been rebellious against the Lord, then how much more
      after my death? '
    28: '²⁸ Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I
      may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness
      against them. '
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt, and turn\
      \ aside from the way which I have commanded you. And evil will befall you in\
      \ the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke\
      \ Him to anger through the work of your hands.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words
      of this song until they were ended:'
  32:
    1: "¹ “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;\nAnd hear, O earth, the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    2: "² Let my teaching drop as the rain,\nMy speech distill as the dew,\nAs raindrops\
      \ on the tender herb,\nAnd as showers on the grass.\n"
    3: "³ For I proclaim the name of the Lord:\nAscribe greatness to our God.\n"
    4: "⁴ He is the Rock, His work is perfect;\nFor all His ways are justice,\nA God\
      \ of truth and without injustice;\nRighteous and upright is He. \n"
    5: "⁵ “They have corrupted themselves;\nThey are not His children,\nBecause of\
      \ their blemish:\nA perverse and crooked generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Do you thus deal with the Lord,\nO foolish and unwise people?\nIs He not\
      \ your Father, who bought you?\nHas He not made you and established you? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember the days of old,\nConsider the years of many generations.\nAsk\
      \ your father, and he will show you;\nYour elders, and they will tell you:\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations,\nWhen He separated\
      \ the sons of Adam,\nHe set the boundaries of the peoples\nAccording to the\
      \ number of the children of Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ For the Lord’s portion is His people;\nJacob is the place of His inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “He found him in a desert land\nAnd in the wasteland, a howling wilderness;\n\
      He encircled him, He instructed him,\nHe kept him as the apple of His eye.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As an eagle stirs up its nest,\nHovers over its young,\nSpreading out\
      \ its wings, taking them up,\nCarrying them on its wings,\n"
    12: "¹² So the Lord alone led him,\nAnd there was no foreign god with him. \n"
    13: "¹³ “He made him ride in the heights of the earth,\nThat he might eat the\
      \ produce of the fields;\nHe made him draw honey from the rock,\nAnd oil from\
      \ the flinty rock;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Curds from the cattle, and milk of the flock,\nWith fat of lambs;\nAnd\
      \ rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,\nWith the choicest wheat;\nAnd you\
      \ drank wine, the blood of the grapes. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked;\nYou grew fat, you grew thick,\nYou\
      \ are obese!\nThen he forsook God who made him,\nAnd scornfully esteemed the\
      \ Rock of his salvation.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods;\nWith abominations they\
      \ provoked Him to anger.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They sacrificed to demons, not to God,\nTo gods they did not know,\nTo\
      \ new gods, new arrivals\nThat your fathers did not fear.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful,\nAnd have forgotten the\
      \ God who fathered you. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “And when the Lord saw it, He spurned them,\nBecause of the provocation\
      \ of His sons and His daughters.\n"
    20: "²⁰ And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them,\nI will see what their end\
      \ will be,\nFor they are a perverse generation,\nChildren in whom is no faith.\n"
    21: "²¹ They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not God;\nThey have moved\
      \ Me to anger by their foolish idols.\nBut I will provoke them to jealousy by\
      \ those who are not a nation;\nI will move them to anger by a foolish nation.\n"
    22: "²² For a fire is kindled in My anger,\nAnd shall burn to the lowest hell;\n\
      It shall consume the earth with her increase,\nAnd set on fire the foundations\
      \ of the mountains. \n"
    23: "²³ ‘I will heap disasters on them;\nI will spend My arrows on them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ They shall be wasted with hunger,\nDevoured by pestilence and bitter destruction;\n\
      I will also send against them the teeth of beasts,\nWith the poison of serpents\
      \ of the dust.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The sword shall destroy outside;\nThere shall be terror within\nFor the\
      \ young man and virgin,\nThe nursing child with the man of gray hairs.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I would have said, “I will dash them in pieces,\nI will make the memory\
      \ of them to cease from among men,”\n"
    27: "²⁷ Had I not feared the wrath of the enemy,\nLest their adversaries should\
      \ misunderstand,\nLest they should say, “Our hand is high;\nAnd it is not the\
      \ Lord who has done all this.” ’ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “For they are a nation void of counsel,\nNor is there any understanding\
      \ in them.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this,\nThat they would consider\
      \ their latter end!\n"
    30: "³⁰ How could one chase a thousand,\nAnd two put ten thousand to flight,\n\
      Unless their Rock had sold them,\nAnd the Lord had surrendered them?\n"
    31: "³¹ For their rock is not like our Rock,\nEven our enemies themselves being\
      \ judges.\n"
    32: "³² For their vine is of the vine of Sodom\nAnd of the fields of Gomorrah;\n\
      Their grapes are grapes of gall,\nTheir clusters are bitter.\n"
    33: "³³ Their wine is the poison of serpents,\nAnd the cruel venom of cobras.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ ‘Is this not laid up in store with Me,\nSealed up among My treasures?\n"
    35: "³⁵ Vengeance is Mine, and recompense;\nTheir foot shall slip in due time;\n\
      For the day of their calamity is at hand,\nAnd the things to come hasten upon\
      \ them.’ \n"
    36: "³⁶ “For the Lord will judge His people\nAnd have compassion on His servants,\n\
      When He sees that their power is gone,\nAnd there is no one remaining, bond\
      \ or free.\n"
    37: "³⁷ He will say: ‘Where are their gods,\nThe rock in which they sought refuge?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Who ate the fat of their sacrifices,\nAnd drank the wine of their drink\
      \ offering?\nLet them rise and help you,\nAnd be your refuge. \n"
    39: "³⁹ ‘Now see that I, even I, am He,\nAnd there is no God besides Me;\nI kill\
      \ and I make alive;\nI wound and I heal;\nNor is there any who can deliver from\
      \ My hand.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ For I raise My hand to heaven,\nAnd say, “As I live forever,\n"
    41: "⁴¹ If I whet My glittering sword,\nAnd My hand takes hold on judgment,\n\
      I will render vengeance to My enemies,\nAnd repay those who hate Me.\n"
    42: "⁴² I will make My arrows drunk with blood,\nAnd My sword shall devour flesh,\n\
      With the blood of the slain and the captives,\nFrom the heads of the leaders\
      \ of the enemy.” ’ \n"
    43: "⁴³ “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people;\nFor He will avenge the blood of\
      \ His servants,\nAnd render vengeance to His adversaries;\nHe will provide atonement\
      \ for His land and His people.” \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ So Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this
      song in the hearing of the people. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel, '
    46: '⁴⁶ and he said to them: “Set your hearts on all the words which I testify
      among you today, which you shall command your children to be careful to observe—all
      the words of this law. '
    47: "⁴⁷ For it is not a futile thing for you, because it is your life, and by\
      \ this word you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the\
      \ Jordan to possess.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then the Lord spoke to Moses that very same day, saying: '
    49: '⁴⁹ “Go up this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of
      Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I give to the children
      of Israel as a possession; '
    50: '⁵⁰ and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people,
      just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people; '
    51: '⁵¹ because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the
      waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, because you did not hallow
      Me in the midst of the children of Israel. '
    52: ⁵² Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into
      the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.”
  33:
    1: '¹ Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children
      of Israel before his death. '
    2: "² And he said:\n“The Lord came from Sinai,\nAnd dawned on them from Seir;\n\
      He shone forth from Mount Paran,\nAnd He came with ten thousands of saints;\n\
      From His right hand\nCame a fiery law for them.\n"
    3: "³ Yes, He loves the people;\nAll His saints are in Your hand;\nThey sit down\
      \ at Your feet;\nEveryone receives Your words.\n"
    4: "⁴ Moses commanded a law for us,\nA heritage of the congregation of Jacob.\n"
    5: "⁵ And He was King in Jeshurun,\nWhen the leaders of the people were gathered,\n\
      All the tribes of Israel together. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Let Reuben live, and not die,\nNor let his men be few.” \n"
    7: "⁷ And this he said of Judah:\n“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah,\nAnd bring\
      \ him to his people;\nLet his hands be sufficient for him,\nAnd may You be a\
      \ help against his enemies.” \n"
    8: "⁸ And of Levi he said:\n“Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your holy\
      \ one,\nWhom You tested at Massah,\nAnd with whom You contended at the waters\
      \ of Meribah,\n"
    9: "⁹ Who says of his father and mother,\n‘I have not seen them’;\nNor did he\
      \ acknowledge his brothers,\nOr know his own children;\nFor they have observed\
      \ Your word\nAnd kept Your covenant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They shall teach Jacob Your judgments,\nAnd Israel Your law.\nThey shall\
      \ put incense before You,\nAnd a whole burnt sacrifice on Your altar.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Bless his substance, Lord,\nAnd accept the work of his hands;\nStrike\
      \ the loins of those who rise against him,\nAnd of those who hate him, that\
      \ they rise not again.” \n"
    12: "¹² Of Benjamin he said:\n“The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by\
      \ Him,\nWho shelters him all the day long;\nAnd he shall dwell between His shoulders.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And of Joseph he said:\n“Blessed of the Lord is his land,\nWith the precious\
      \ things of heaven, with the dew,\nAnd the deep lying beneath,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With the precious fruits of the sun,\nWith the precious produce of the\
      \ months,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ With the best things of the ancient mountains,\nWith the precious things\
      \ of the everlasting hills,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ With the precious things of the earth and its fullness,\nAnd the favor\
      \ of Him who dwelt in the bush.\nLet the blessing come ‘on the head of Joseph,\n\
      And on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.’\n"
    17: "¹⁷ His glory is like a firstborn bull,\nAnd his horns like the horns of the\
      \ wild ox;\nTogether with them\nHe shall push the peoples\nTo the ends of the\
      \ earth;\nThey are the ten thousands of Ephraim,\nAnd they are the thousands\
      \ of Manasseh.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And of Zebulun he said:\n“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,\nAnd Issachar\
      \ in your tents!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They shall call the peoples to the mountain;\nThere they shall offer sacrifices\
      \ of righteousness;\nFor they shall partake of the abundance of the seas\nAnd\
      \ of treasures hidden in the sand.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ And of Gad he said:\n“Blessed is he who enlarges Gad;\nHe dwells as a\
      \ lion,\nAnd tears the arm and the crown of his head.\n"
    21: "²¹ He provided the first part for himself,\nBecause a lawgiver’s portion\
      \ was reserved there.\nHe came with the heads of the people;\nHe administered\
      \ the justice of the Lord,\nAnd His judgments with Israel.” \n"
    22: "²² And of Dan he said:\n“Dan is a lion’s whelp;\nHe shall leap from Bashan.”\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And of Naphtali he said:\n“O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,\nAnd full\
      \ of the blessing of the Lord,\nPossess the west and the south.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ And of Asher he said:\n“Asher is most blessed of sons;\nLet him be favored\
      \ by his brothers,\nAnd let him dip his foot in oil.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your sandals shall be iron and bronze;\nAs your days, so shall your strength\
      \ be. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “There is no one like the God of Jeshurun,\nWho rides the heavens to help\
      \ you,\nAnd in His excellency on the clouds.\n"
    27: "²⁷ The eternal God is your refuge,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms;\n\
      He will thrust out the enemy from before you,\nAnd will say, ‘Destroy!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ Then Israel shall dwell in safety,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone,\nIn a\

  34:
    1: '¹ Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of
      Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land of
      Gilead as far as Dan, '
    2: '² all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah
      as far as the Western Sea, '

    4: "⁴ Then the Lord said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to give Abraham,\

    6: '⁶ And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but
      no one knows his grave to this day. '
    7: '⁷ Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not
      dim nor his natural vigor diminished. '
    8: "⁸ And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days.\
      \ So the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had\

    10: '¹⁰ But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom
