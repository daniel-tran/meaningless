Daniel:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. '
    2: "² And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the\
      \ articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to\
      \ the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house\
      \ of his god. \n"
    3: '³ Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some
      of the children of Israel and some of the king’s descendants and some of the
      nobles, '
    4: '⁴ young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all
      wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve
      in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature
      of the Chaldeans. '
    5: '⁵ And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king’s delicacies
      and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that
      at the end of that time they might serve before the king. '
    6: '⁶ Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
      and Azariah. '
    7: "⁷ To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar;\
      \ to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego. \n"
    8: '⁸ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the
      portion of the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore
      he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. '
    9: '⁹ Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the
      eunuchs. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king,\
      \ who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking\
      \ worse than the young men who are your age? Then you would endanger my head\
      \ before the king.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over
      Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, '
    12: '¹² “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables
      to eat and water to drink. '
    13: '¹³ Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of
      the young men who eat the portion of the king’s delicacies; and as you see fit,
      so deal with your servants.” '
    14: "¹⁴ So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in
      flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies. '
    16: "¹⁶ Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that\
      \ they were to drink, and gave them vegetables. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all\
      \ literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be
      brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like
      Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king. '
    20: '²⁰ And in all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined
      them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers
      who were in all his realm. '
    21: ²¹ Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.
  2:
    1: '¹ Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams;
      and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him. '
    2: '² Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the
      sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood
      before the king. '
    3: "³ And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious\
      \ to know the dream.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever!\
      \ Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.” \n"
    5: '⁵ The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you
      do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut
      in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. '
    6: "⁶ However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive\
      \ from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its\
      \ interpretation.” \n"
    7: "⁷ They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream,\
      \ and we will give its interpretation.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time,
      because you see that my decision is firm: '
    9: "⁹ if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you!\
      \ For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time\
      \ has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give\
      \ me its interpretation.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth
      who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked
      such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. '
    11: "¹¹ It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other\
      \ who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command
      to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. '
    13: "¹³ So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise men; and they\
      \ sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the
      king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon; '
    15: "¹⁵ he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree\
      \ from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell
      the king the interpretation. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah,
      Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, '
    18: '¹⁸ that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret,
      so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise
      men of Babylon. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed\
      \ the God of heaven. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Daniel answered and said:\n“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,\n\
      For wisdom and might are His.\n"
    21: "²¹ And He changes the times and the seasons;\nHe removes kings and raises\
      \ up kings;\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\nAnd knowledge to those who have understanding.\n"
    22: "²² He reveals deep and secret things;\nHe knows what is in the darkness,\n\
      And light dwells with Him. \n"
    23: "²³ “I thank You and praise You,\nO God of my fathers;\nYou have given me\
      \ wisdom and might,\nAnd have now made known to me what we asked of You,\nFor\
      \ You have made known to us the king’s demand.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy\
      \ the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the\
      \ wise men of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the\
      \ interpretation.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him,\
      \ “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king\
      \ the interpretation.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are\
      \ you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which
      the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the
      soothsayers cannot declare to the king. '
    28: '²⁸ But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known
      to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the
      visions of your head upon your bed, were these: '
    29: '²⁹ As for you, O king, thoughts came to your mind while on your bed, about
      what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known
      to you what will be. '
    30: "³⁰ But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have\
      \ more wisdom than anyone living, but for our sakes who make known the interpretation\
      \ to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart. \n"
    31: '³¹ “You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image,
      whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome. '
    32: '³² This image’s head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its
      belly and thighs of bronze, '
    33: '³³ its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. '
    34: '³⁴ You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the
      image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. '
    35: "³⁵ Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed\
      \ together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind\
      \ carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck\
      \ the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the
      king. '
    37: '³⁷ You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you
      a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; '
    38: '³⁸ and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and
      the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you
      ruler over them all—you are this head of gold. '
    39: '³⁹ But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another,
      a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. '
    40: '⁴⁰ And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks
      in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom
      will break in pieces and crush all the others. '
    41: '⁴¹ Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly
      of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be
      in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. '
    42: '⁴² And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so
      the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. '
    43: '⁴³ As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed
      of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with
      clay. '
    44: '⁴⁴ And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
      which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people;
      it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
      forever. '
    45: "⁴⁵ Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without\
      \ hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver,\
      \ and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass\
      \ after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.” \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and
      commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The king answered Daniel, and said, “Truly your God is the God of gods,
      the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.” '
    48: '⁴⁸ Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made
      him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all
      the wise men of Babylon. '
    49: ⁴⁹ Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego
      over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of the
      king.
  3:
    1: '¹ Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits
      and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province
      of Babylon. '
    2: '² And King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps, the administrators,
      the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates,
      and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image
      which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. '
    3: '³ So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers,
      the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered
      together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up;
      and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. '
    4: '⁴ Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations,
      and languages, '
    5: '⁵ that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and
      psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship
      the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; '
    6: "⁶ and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into\
      \ the midst of a burning fiery furnace.” \n"
    7: "⁷ So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute,\
      \ harp, and lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations,\
      \ and languages fell down and worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ had set up. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews. '
    9: '⁹ They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever! '
    10: '¹⁰ You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the
      horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music,
      shall fall down and worship the gold image; '
    11: '¹¹ and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst
      of a burning fiery furnace. '
    12: "¹² There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province\
      \ of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not\
      \ paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image\
      \ which you have set up.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach,
      Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king. '
    14: '¹⁴ Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach,
      and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which
      I have set up? '
    15: "¹⁵ Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute,\
      \ harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall\
      \ down and worship the image which I have made, good! But if you do not worship,\
      \ you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And\
      \ who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar,
      we have no need to answer you in this matter. '
    17: '¹⁷ If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
      the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. '
    18: "¹⁸ But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your\
      \ gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed
      toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat
      the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. '
    20: '²⁰ And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind
      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace. '
    21: '²¹ Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans,
      and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery
      furnace. '
    22: '²² Therefore, because the king’s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly
      hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
      Abed-Nego. '
    23: "²³ And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound\
      \ into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste and spoke,\
      \ saying to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the midst\
      \ of the fire?”\nThey answered and said to the king, “True, O king.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the\
      \ fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of\
      \ God.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and
      spoke, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of the Most High
      God, come out, and come here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from
      the midst of the fire. '
    27: "²⁷ And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king’s counselors\
      \ gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no\
      \ power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected,\
      \ and the smell of fire was not on them. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
      and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in
      Him, and they have frustrated the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that
      they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God! '
    29: "²⁹ Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks\
      \ anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego shall be\
      \ cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap; because there is\
      \ no other God who can deliver like this.” \n"
    30: ³⁰ Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego in the province
      of Babylon.
  4:
    1: "¹ Nebuchadnezzar the king, \nTo all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell\
      \ in all the earth: \nPeace be multiplied to you. \n"
    2: "² I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God\
      \ has worked for me. \n"
    3: "³ How great are His signs,\nAnd how mighty His wonders!\nHis kingdom is an\
      \ everlasting kingdom,\nAnd His dominion is from generation to generation. \n"
    4: '⁴ I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. '
    5: '⁵ I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions
      of my head troubled me. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before
      me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. '
    7: '⁷ Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers
      came in, and I told them the dream; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. '
    8: '⁸ But at last Daniel came before me (his name is Belteshazzar, according to
      the name of my god; in him is the Spirit of the Holy God), and I told the dream
      before him, saying: '
    9: "⁹ “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of\
      \ the Holy God is in you, and no secret troubles you, explain to me the visions\
      \ of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “These were the visions of my head while on my bed: \nI was looking, and\
      \ behold,\nA tree in the midst of the earth,\nAnd its height was great.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The tree grew and became strong;\nIts height reached to the heavens,\n\
      And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth.\n"
    12: "¹² Its leaves were lovely,\nIts fruit abundant,\nAnd in it was food for all.\n\
      The beasts of the field found shade under it,\nThe birds of the heavens dwelt\
      \ in its branches,\nAnd all flesh was fed from it. \n"
    13: '¹³ “I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed, and there was a watcher,
      a holy one, coming down from heaven. '
    14: "¹⁴ He cried aloud and said thus: \n‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches,\n\
      Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.\nLet the beasts get out from under\
      \ it,\nAnd the birds from its branches.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Nevertheless leave the stump and roots in the earth,\nBound with a band\
      \ of iron and bronze,\nIn the tender grass of the field.\nLet it be wet with\
      \ the dew of heaven,\nAnd let him graze with the beasts\nOn the grass of the\
      \ earth.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Let his heart be changed from that of a man,\nLet him be given the heart\
      \ of a beast,\nAnd let seven times pass over him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘This decision is by the decree of the watchers,\nAnd the sentence by\
      \ the word of the holy ones,\nIn order that the living may know\nThat the Most\
      \ High rules in the kingdom of men,\nGives it to whomever He will,\nAnd sets\
      \ over it the lowest of men.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar,\
      \ declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able\
      \ to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the Spirit of\
      \ the Holy God is in you.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for a time, and\
      \ his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke, and said, “Belteshazzar, do\
      \ not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.”\nBelteshazzar answered\
      \ and said, “My lord, may the dream concern those who hate you, and its interpretation\
      \ concern your enemies! \n"
    20: '²⁰ “The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached
      to the heavens and which could be seen by all the earth, '
    21: '²¹ whose leaves were lovely and its fruit abundant, in which was food for
      all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds
      of the heaven had their home— '
    22: "²² it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong; for your greatness\
      \ has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the end of the\
      \ earth. \n"
    23: '²³ “And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from
      heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its stump and
      roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze in the tender grass
      of the field; let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let him graze with the
      beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him’; '
    24: '²⁴ this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most
      High, which has come upon my lord the king: '
    25: "²⁵ They shall drive you from men, your dwelling shall be with the beasts\
      \ of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen. They shall wet\
      \ you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you\
      \ know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever\
      \ He chooses. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “And inasmuch as they gave the command to leave the stump and roots of
      the tree, your kingdom shall be assured to you, after you come to know that
      Heaven rules. '
    27: "²⁷ Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you; break off your\
      \ sins by being righteous, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.\
      \ Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. '
    29: '²⁹ At the end of the twelve months he was walking about the royal palace
      of Babylon. '
    30: "³⁰ The king spoke, saying, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built\
      \ for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?”\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice fell from heaven:
      “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: the kingdom has departed from you! '
    32: "³² And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the\
      \ beasts of the field. They shall make you eat grass like oxen; and seven times\
      \ shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom\
      \ of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses.” \n"
    33: "³³ That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was\
      \ driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of\
      \ heaven till his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’\
      \ claws. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And at the end of the time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven,\
      \ and my understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and praised\
      \ and honored Him who lives forever: \nFor His dominion is an everlasting dominion,\n\
      And His kingdom is from generation to generation.\n"
    35: "³⁵ All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;\nHe does according\
      \ to His will in the army of heaven\nAnd among the inhabitants of the earth.\n\
      No one can restrain His hand\nOr say to Him, “What have You done?” \n"
    36: '³⁶ At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom,
      my honor and splendor returned to me. My counselors and nobles resorted to me,
      I was restored to my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me. '
    37: ³⁷ Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all
      of whose works are truth, and His ways justice. And those who walk in pride
      He is able to put down.
  5:
    1: '¹ Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and
      drank wine in the presence of the thousand. '
    2: '² While he tasted the wine, Belshazzar gave the command to bring the gold
      and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple
      which had been in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his
      concubines might drink from them. '
    3: '³ Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of
      the house of God which had been in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his
      wives, and his concubines drank from them. '
    4: "⁴ They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron,\
      \ wood and stone. \n"
    5: '⁵ In the same hour the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite
      the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king
      saw the part of the hand that wrote. '
    6: '⁶ Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that
      the joints of his hips were loosened and his knees knocked against each other. '
    7: '⁷ The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the
      soothsayers. The king spoke, saying to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads
      this writing, and tells me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple
      and have a chain of gold around his neck; and he shall be the third ruler in
      the kingdom.” '
    8: '⁸ Now all the king’s wise men came, but they could not read the writing, or
      make known to the king its interpretation. '
    9: "⁹ Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, his countenance was changed,\
      \ and his lords were astonished. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came to the
      banquet hall. The queen spoke, saying, “O king, live forever! Do not let your
      thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance change. '
    11: '¹¹ There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God.
      And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the
      wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your
      father the king—made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and
      soothsayers. '
    12: "¹² Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting\
      \ dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel,\
      \ whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give\
      \ the interpretation.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke, and said to
      Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives from Judah, whom my
      father the king brought from Judah? '
    14: '¹⁴ I have heard of you, that the Spirit of God is in you, and that light
      and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that
      they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they
      could not give the interpretation of the thing. '
    16: "¹⁶ And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and explain\
      \ enigmas. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation,\
      \ you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck,\
      \ and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Daniel answered, and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for
      yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the
      king, and make known to him the interpretation. '
    18: '¹⁸ O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and
      majesty, glory and honor. '
    19: '¹⁹ And because of the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and
      languages trembled and feared before him. Whomever he wished, he executed; whomever
      he wished, he kept alive; whomever he wished, he set up; and whomever he wished,
      he put down. '
    20: '²⁰ But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened in pride,
      he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. '
    21: "²¹ Then he was driven from the sons of men, his heart was made like the beasts,\
      \ and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. They fed him with grass like oxen,\
      \ and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the Most High\
      \ God rules in the kingdom of men, and appoints over it whomever He chooses.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² “But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, although you
      knew all this. '
    23: '²³ And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven. They have
      brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives
      and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods
      of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which do not see or hear
      or know; and the God who holds your breath in His hand and owns all your ways,
      you have not glorified. '
    24: "²⁴ Then the fingers of the hand were sent from Him, and this writing was\
      \ written. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “And this is the inscription that was written:\nMENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ This is the interpretation of each word. MENE: God has numbered your kingdom,
      and finished it; '
    27: '²⁷ TEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting; '
    28: '²⁸ PERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” '
    29: "²⁹ Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with purple\
      \ and put a chain of gold around his neck, and made a proclamation concerning\
      \ him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. \n"
    30: '³⁰ That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain. '
    31: ³¹ And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
  6:
    1: '¹ It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps,
      to be over the whole kingdom; '
    2: '² and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps
      might give account to them, so that the king would suffer no loss. '
    3: '³ Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps,
      because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave thought to setting
      him over the whole realm. '
    4: '⁴ So the governors and satraps sought to find some charge against Daniel concerning
      the kingdom; but they could find no charge or fault, because he was faithful;
      nor was there any error or fault found in him. '
    5: "⁵ Then these men said, “We shall not find any charge against this Daniel unless\
      \ we find it against him concerning the law of his God.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So these governors and satraps thronged before the king, and said thus to
      him: “King Darius, live forever! '
    7: '⁷ All the governors of the kingdom, the administrators and satraps, the counselors
      and advisors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make
      a firm decree, that whoever petitions any god or man for thirty days, except
      you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. '
    8: '⁸ Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, so that it cannot
      be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.” '
    9: "⁹ Therefore King Darius signed the written decree. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in\
      \ his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his\
      \ knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as\
      \ was his custom since early days. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication
      before his God. '
    12: "¹² And they went before the king, and spoke concerning the king’s decree:\
      \ “Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man\
      \ within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”\n\
      The king answered and said, “The thing is true, according to the law of the\
      \ Medes and Persians, which does not alter.” \n"
    13: "¹³ So they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is one of\
      \ the captives from Judah, does not show due regard for you, O king, or for\
      \ the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself,
      and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down
      of the sun to deliver him. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king,\
      \ that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which\
      \ the king establishes may be changed.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast him into
      the den of lions. But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you
      serve continually, He will deliver you.” '
    17: "¹⁷ Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king\
      \ sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that\
      \ the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians
      were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the
      den of lions. '
    20: "²⁰ And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel.\
      \ The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has\
      \ your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! '
    22: "²² My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not\
      \ hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have\
      \ done no wrong before you.” \n"
    23: "²³ Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should\
      \ take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and\
      \ no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the king gave the command, and they brought those men who had accused\
      \ Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and\
      \ their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in\
      \ pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then King Darius wrote:\nTo all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell\
      \ in all the earth: \nPeace be multiplied to you. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men must tremble\
      \ and fear before the God of Daniel. \nFor He is the living God,\nAnd steadfast\
      \ forever;\nHis kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed,\nAnd His dominion\
      \ shall endure to the end.\n"
    27: "²⁷ He delivers and rescues,\nAnd He works signs and wonders\nIn heaven and\
      \ on earth,\nWho has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. \n"
    28: ²⁸ So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus
      the Persian.
  7:
    1: "¹ In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and\
      \ visions of his head while on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling\
      \ the main facts. \n"
    2: '² Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four
      winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. '
    3: '³ And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other. '
    4: "⁴ The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings\
      \ were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on\
      \ two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. \n"
    5: "⁵ “And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on\
      \ one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said\
      \ thus to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on\
      \ its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion\
      \ was given to it. \n"
    7: '⁷ “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful
      and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring,
      breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different
      from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. '
    8: "⁸ I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming\
      \ up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the\
      \ roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth\
      \ speaking pompous words. \n"
    9: "⁹ “I watched till thrones were put in place,\nAnd the Ancient of Days was\
      \ seated;\nHis garment was white as snow,\nAnd the hair of His head was like\
      \ pure wool.\nHis throne was a fiery flame,\nIts wheels a burning fire;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A fiery stream issued\nAnd came forth from before Him.\nA thousand thousands\
      \ ministered to Him;\nTen thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.\nThe\
      \ court was seated,\nAnd the books were opened. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn
      was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and
      given to the burning flame. '
    12: "¹² As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet\
      \ their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. \n"
    13: "¹³ “I was watching in the night visions,\nAnd behold, One like the Son of\
      \ Man,\nComing with the clouds of heaven!\nHe came to the Ancient of Days,\n\
      And they brought Him near before Him.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,\nThat all peoples,\
      \ nations, and languages should serve Him.\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion,\n\
      Which shall not pass away,\nAnd His kingdom the one\nWhich shall not be destroyed.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within my body, and the visions of
      my head troubled me. '
    16: '¹⁶ I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all
      this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of
      the earth. '
    18: "¹⁸ But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess\
      \ the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different
      from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its nails
      of bronze, which devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its
      feet; '
    20: "²⁰ and the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came\
      \ up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth\
      \ which spoke pompous words, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ “I was watching; and the same horn was making war against the saints,
      and prevailing against them, '
    22: "²² until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made in favor of the\
      \ saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ “Thus he said:\n‘The fourth beast shall be\nA fourth kingdom on earth,\n\
      Which shall be different from all other kingdoms,\nAnd shall devour the whole\
      \ earth,\nTrample it and break it in pieces.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The ten horns are ten kings\nWho shall arise from this kingdom.\nAnd another\
      \ shall rise after them;\nHe shall be different from the first ones,\nAnd shall\
      \ subdue three kings.\n"
    25: "²⁵ He shall speak pompous words against the Most High,\nShall persecute the\
      \ saints of the Most High,\nAnd shall intend to change times and law.\nThen\
      \ the saints shall be given into his hand\nFor a time and times and half a time.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ ‘But the court shall be seated,\nAnd they shall take away his dominion,\n\
      To consume and destroy it forever.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Then the kingdom and dominion,\nAnd the greatness of the kingdoms under\
      \ the whole heaven,\nShall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.\n\
      His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,\nAnd all dominions shall serve and obey\
      \ Him.’ \n"
    28: ²⁸ “This is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly
      troubled me, and my countenance changed; but I kept the matter in my heart.”
  8:
    1: '¹ In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me—to
      me, Daniel—after the one that appeared to me the first time. '
    2: '² I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I was
      in Shushan, the citadel, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the
      vision that I was by the River Ulai. '
    3: '³ Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was
      a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high; but one was higher than
      the other, and the higher one came up last. '
    4: "⁴ I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal\
      \ could withstand him; nor was there any that could deliver from his hand, but\
      \ he did according to his will and became great. \n"
    5: '⁵ And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across
      the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had
      a notable horn between his eyes. '
    6: '⁶ Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside
      the river, and ran at him with furious power. '
    7: "⁷ And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked\
      \ the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand\
      \ him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no\
      \ one that could deliver the ram from his hand. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the
      large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the
      four winds of heaven. '
    9: '⁹ And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward
      the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious Land. '
    10: '¹⁰ And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host
      and some of the stars to the ground, and trampled them. '
    11: '¹¹ He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host; and by him
      the daily sacrifices were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast
      down. '
    12: "¹² Because of transgression, an army was given over to the horn to oppose\
      \ the daily sacrifices; and he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this\
      \ and prospered. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain\
      \ one who was speaking, “How long will the vision be, concerning the daily sacrifices\
      \ and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and\
      \ the host to be trampled underfoot?” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary\
      \ shall be cleansed.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking
      the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of
      a man. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, who called, and
      said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” '
    17: "¹⁷ So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell\
      \ on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision refers\
      \ to the time of the end.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to
      the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright. '
    19: '¹⁹ And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the
      latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be. '
    20: '²⁰ The ram which you saw, having the two horns—they are the kings of Media
      and Persia. '
    21: '²¹ And the male goat is the kingdom of Greece. The large horn that is between
      its eyes is the first king. '
    22: "²² As for the broken horn and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms\
      \ shall arise out of that nation, but not with its power. \n"
    23: "²³ “And in the latter time of their kingdom,\nWhen the transgressors have\
      \ reached their fullness,\nA king shall arise,\nHaving fierce features,\nWho\
      \ understands sinister schemes.\n"
    24: "²⁴ His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power;\nHe shall destroy\
      \ fearfully,\nAnd shall prosper and thrive;\nHe shall destroy the mighty, and\
      \ also the holy people. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Through his cunning\nHe shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule;\n\
      And he shall exalt himself in his heart.\nHe shall destroy many in their prosperity.\n\
      He shall even rise against the Prince of princes;\nBut he shall be broken without\
      \ human means. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “And the vision of the evenings and mornings\nWhich was told is true;\n\
      Therefore seal up the vision,\nFor it refers to many days in the future.” \n"
    27: ²⁷ And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went
      about the king’s business. I was astonished by the vision, but no one understood
      it.
  9:
    1: '¹ In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the lineage of the
      Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans— '
    2: "² in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number\
      \ of the years specified by the word of the Lord through Jeremiah the prophet,\
      \ that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. \n"
    3: '³ Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications,
      with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. '
    4: '⁴ And I prayed to the Lord my God, and made confession, and said, “O Lord,
      great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love
      Him, and with those who keep His commandments, '
    5: '⁵ we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled,
      even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments. '
    6: '⁶ Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name
      to our kings and our princes, to our fathers and all the people of the land. '
    7: "⁷ O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us shame of face, as it is\
      \ this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel,\
      \ those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven\
      \ them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, our princes, and our
      fathers, because we have sinned against You. '
    9: '⁹ To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled
      against Him. '
    10: '¹⁰ We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws,
      which He set before us by His servants the prophets. '
    11: '¹¹ Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not
      to obey Your voice; therefore the curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses
      the servant of God have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against
      Him. '
    12: "¹² And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against\
      \ our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under\
      \ the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ “As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon
      us; yet we have not made our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn
      from our iniquities and understand Your truth. '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore the Lord has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon
      us; for the Lord our God is righteous in all the works which He does, though
      we have not obeyed His voice. '
    15: "¹⁵ And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt\
      \ with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, as it is this day—we have sinned,\
      \ we have done wickedly! \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and
      Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; because
      for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people
      are a reproach to all those around us. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications,
      and for the Lord’s sake cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary, which is
      desolate. '
    18: '¹⁸ O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations,
      and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications
      before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great mercies. '
    19: "¹⁹ O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for\
      \ Your own sake, my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of
      my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for
      the holy mountain of my God, '
    21: '²¹ yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen
      in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about
      the time of the evening offering. '
    22: '²² And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, “O Daniel, I have now
      come forth to give you skill to understand. '
    23: "²³ At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have\
      \ come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter,\
      \ and understand the vision: \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Seventy weeks are determined\nFor your people and for your holy city,\n\
      To finish the transgression,\nTo make an end of sins,\nTo make reconciliation\
      \ for iniquity,\nTo bring in everlasting righteousness,\nTo seal up vision and\
      \ prophecy,\nAnd to anoint the Most Holy. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Know therefore and understand,\nThat from the going forth of the command\n\
      To restore and build Jerusalem\nUntil Messiah the Prince,\nThere shall be seven\
      \ weeks and sixty-two weeks;\nThe street shall be built again, and the wall,\n\
      Even in troublesome times. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “And after the sixty-two weeks\nMessiah shall be cut off, but not for\
      \ Himself;\nAnd the people of the prince who is to come\nShall destroy the city\
      \ and the sanctuary.\nThe end of it shall be with a flood,\nAnd till the end\
      \ of the war desolations are determined.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week;\nBut in the middle\
      \ of the week\nHe shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.\nAnd on the\
      \ wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,\nEven until the consummation,\
      \ which is determined,\nIs poured out on the desolate.”"
  10:
    1: '¹ In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel,
      whose name was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, but the appointed
      time was long; and he understood the message, and had understanding of the vision. '
    2: '² In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. '
    3: "³ I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint\
      \ myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of
      the great river, that is, the Tigris, '
    5: '⁵ I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen,
      whose waist was girded with gold of Uphaz! '
    6: "⁶ His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his\
      \ eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color,\
      \ and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude. \n"
    7: '⁷ And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not
      see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide
      themselves. '
    8: '⁸ Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength
      remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty in me, and I retained no
      strength. '
    9: "⁹ Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words\
      \ I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and on
      the palms of my hands. '
    11: "¹¹ And he said to me, “O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words\
      \ that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.”\
      \ While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling. \n"
    12: '¹² Then he said to me, “Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that
      you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your
      words were heard; and I have come because of your words. '
    13: '¹³ But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days;
      and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been
      left alone there with the kings of Persia. '
    14: "¹⁴ Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people\
      \ in the latter days, for the vision refers to many days yet to come.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face toward the ground
      and became speechless. '
    16: '¹⁶ And suddenly, one having the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips;
      then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, “My lord,
      because of the vision my sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have retained no
      strength. '
    17: "¹⁷ For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me,\
      \ no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then again, the one having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened
      me. '
    19: "¹⁹ And he said, “O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace be to you; be strong,\
      \ yes, be strong!”\nSo when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let\
      \ my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return
      to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed the prince
      of Greece will come. '
    21: ²¹ But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds
      me against these, except Michael your prince.
  11:
    1: '¹ “Also in the first year of Darius the Mede, I, even I, stood up to confirm
      and strengthen him.) '
    2: '² And now I will tell you the truth: Behold, three more kings will arise in
      Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than them all; by his strength, through
      his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. '
    3: '³ Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion, and
      do according to his will. '
    4: "⁴ And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken up and divided toward\
      \ the four winds of heaven, but not among his posterity nor according to his\
      \ dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be uprooted, even for\
      \ others besides these. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Also the king of the South shall become strong, as well as one of his princes;
      and he shall gain power over him and have dominion. His dominion shall be a
      great dominion. '
    6: '⁶ And at the end of some years they shall join forces, for the daughter of
      the king of the South shall go to the king of the North to make an agreement;
      but she shall not retain the power of her authority, and neither he nor his
      authority shall stand; but she shall be given up, with those who brought her,
      and with him who begot her, and with him who strengthened her in those times. '
    7: '⁷ But from a branch of her roots one shall arise in his place, who shall come
      with an army, enter the fortress of the king of the North, and deal with them
      and prevail. '
    8: "⁸ And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt, with their princes\
      \ and their precious articles of silver and gold; and he shall continue more\
      \ years than the king of the North. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Also the king of the North shall come to the kingdom of the king of the
      South, but shall return to his own land. '
    10: "¹⁰ However his sons shall stir up strife, and assemble a multitude of great\
      \ forces; and one shall certainly come and overwhelm and pass through; then\
      \ he shall return to his fortress and stir up strife. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “And the king of the South shall be moved with rage, and go out and fight
      with him, with the king of the North, who shall muster a great multitude; but
      the multitude shall be given into the hand of his enemy. '
    12: '¹² When he has taken away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up; and
      he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail. '
    13: "¹³ For the king of the North will return and muster a multitude greater than\
      \ the former, and shall certainly come at the end of some years with a great\
      \ army and much equipment. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Now in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South.
      Also, violent men of your people shall exalt themselves in fulfillment of the
      vision, but they shall fall. '
    15: '¹⁵ So the king of the North shall come and build a siege mound, and take
      a fortified city; and the forces of the South shall not withstand him. Even
      his choice troops shall have no strength to resist. '
    16: "¹⁶ But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and no\
      \ one shall stand against him. He shall stand in the Glorious Land with destruction\
      \ in his power. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom,
      and upright ones with him; thus shall he do. And he shall give him the daughter
      of women to destroy it; but she shall not stand with him, or be for him. '
    18: '¹⁸ After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many.
      But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end; and with the reproach
      removed, he shall turn back on him. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land; but he\
      \ shall stumble and fall, and not be found. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes on the glorious
      kingdom; but within a few days he shall be destroyed, but not in anger or in
      battle. '
    21: '²¹ And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they will not give
      the honor of royalty; but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom
      by intrigue. '
    22: '²² With the force of a flood they shall be swept away from before him and
      be broken, and also the prince of the covenant. '
    23: '²³ And after the league is made with him he shall act deceitfully, for he
      shall come up and become strong with a small number of people. '
    24: "²⁴ He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province;\
      \ and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers: he shall\
      \ disperse among them the plunder, spoil, and riches; and he shall devise his\
      \ plans against the strongholds, but only for a time. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South
      with a great army. And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with
      a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise
      plans against him. '
    26: '²⁶ Yes, those who eat of the portion of his delicacies shall destroy him;
      his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. '
    27: '²⁷ Both these kings’ hearts shall be bent on evil, and they shall speak lies
      at the same table; but it shall not prosper, for the end will still be at the
      appointed time. '
    28: "²⁸ While returning to his land with great riches, his heart shall be moved\
      \ against the holy covenant; so he shall do damage and return to his own land.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ “At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south; but it
      shall not be like the former or the latter. '
    30: "³⁰ For ships from Cyprus shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved,\
      \ and return in rage against the holy covenant, and do damage.\n“So he shall\
      \ return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. "
    31: '³¹ And forces shall be mustered by him, and they shall defile the sanctuary
      fortress; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices, and place there the
      abomination of desolation. '
    32: '³² Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery;
      but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits. '
    33: '³³ And those of the people who understand shall instruct many; yet for many
      days they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plundering. '
    34: '³⁴ Now when they fall, they shall be aided with a little help; but many shall
      join with them by intrigue. '
    35: "³⁵ And some of those of understanding shall fall, to refine them, purify\
      \ them, and make them white, until the time of the end; because it is still\
      \ for the appointed time. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Then the king shall do according to his own will: he shall exalt and
      magnify himself above every god, shall speak blasphemies against the God of
      gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been
      determined shall be done. '
    37: '³⁷ He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women,
      nor regard any god; for he shall exalt himself above them all. '
    38: '³⁸ But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which
      his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious
      stones and pleasant things. '
    39: "³⁹ Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses with a foreign god,\
      \ which he shall acknowledge, and advance its glory; and he shall cause them\
      \ to rule over many, and divide the land for gain. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “At the time of the end the king of the South shall attack him; and the
      king of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, horsemen,
      and with many ships; and he shall enter the countries, overwhelm them, and pass
      through. '
    41: '⁴¹ He shall also enter the Glorious Land, and many countries shall be overthrown;
      but these shall escape from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the prominent people of
      Ammon. '
    42: '⁴² He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt
      shall not escape. '
    43: '⁴³ He shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all
      the precious things of Egypt; also the Libyans and Ethiopians shall follow at
      his heels. '
    44: '⁴⁴ But news from the east and the north shall trouble him; therefore he shall
      go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many. '
    45: ⁴⁵ And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the glorious
      holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and no one will help him.
  12:
    1: "¹ “At that time Michael shall stand up,\nThe great prince who stands watch\
      \ over the sons of your people;\nAnd there shall be a time of trouble,\nSuch\
      \ as never was since there was a nation,\nEven to that time.\nAnd at that time\
      \ your people shall be delivered,\nEvery one who is found written in the book.\n"
    2: "² And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,\nSome\
      \ to everlasting life,\nSome to shame and everlasting contempt.\n"
    3: "³ Those who are wise shall shine\nLike the brightness of the firmament,\n\

    5: '⁵ Then I, Daniel, looked; and there stood two others, one on this riverbank
      and the other on that riverbank. '
    6: "⁶ And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the\
      \ river, “How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders be?” \n"
    7: "⁷ Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river,\

    8: "⁸ Although I heard, I did not understand. Then I said, “My lord, what shall\
      \ be the end of these things?” \n"
    9: '⁹ And he said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed
      till the time of the end. '
    10: "¹⁰ Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall\
      \ do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.\

    11: '¹¹ “And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination
