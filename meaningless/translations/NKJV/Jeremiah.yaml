Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth
      in the land of Benjamin, '
    2: '² to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon,
      king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. '
    3: "³ It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,\
      \ until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of\
      \ Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you;\nBefore you were born I sanctified\
      \ you;\nI ordained you a prophet to the nations.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then said I:\n“Ah, Lord God!\nBehold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ But the Lord said to me:\n“Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’\nFor you shall go\
      \ to all to whom I send you,\nAnd whatever I command you, you shall speak.\n"
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid of their faces,\nFor I am with you to deliver you,” says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the Lord said\
      \ to me:\n“Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms,\n\
      To root out and to pull down,\nTo destroy and to throw down,\nTo build and to\
      \ plant.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you\
      \ see?”\nAnd I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well, for I am ready to perform\
      \ My word.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying, “What do\
      \ you see?”\nAnd I said, “I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the\
      \ north.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then the Lord said to me:\n“Out of the north calamity shall break forth\n\
      On all the inhabitants of the land.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For behold, I am calling\nAll the families of the kingdoms of the north,”\
      \ says the Lord;\n“They shall come and each one set his throne\nAt the entrance\
      \ of the gates of Jerusalem,\nAgainst all its walls all around,\nAnd against\
      \ all the cities of Judah.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I will utter My judgments\nAgainst them concerning all their wickedness,\n\
      Because they have forsaken Me,\nBurned incense to other gods,\nAnd worshiped\
      \ the works of their own hands. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore prepare yourself and arise,\nAnd speak to them all that I command\
      \ you.\nDo not be dismayed before their faces,\nLest I dismay you before them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For behold, I have made you this day\nA fortified city and an iron pillar,\n\
      And bronze walls against the whole land—\nAgainst the kings of Judah,\nAgainst\
      \ its princes,\nAgainst its priests,\nAnd against the people of the land.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They will fight against you,\nBut they shall not prevail against you.\n\
      For I am with you,” says the Lord, “to deliver you.”"
  2:
    1: '¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Go and cry in the hearing of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord:\n\
      “I remember you,\nThe kindness of your youth,\nThe love of your betrothal,\n\
      When you went after Me in the wilderness,\nIn a land not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holiness to the Lord,\nThe firstfruits of His increase.\nAll\
      \ that devour him will offend;\nDisaster will come upon them,” says the Lord.’\
      \ ” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob and all the families of the
      house of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord:\n“What injustice have your fathers found in Me,\nThat\
      \ they have gone far from Me,\nHave followed idols,\nAnd have become idolaters?\n"
    6: "⁶ Neither did they say, ‘Where is the Lord,\nWho brought us up out of the\
      \ land of Egypt,\nWho led us through the wilderness,\nThrough a land of deserts\
      \ and pits,\nThrough a land of drought and the shadow of death,\nThrough a land\
      \ that no one crossed\nAnd where no one dwelt?’\n"
    7: "⁷ I brought you into a bountiful country,\nTo eat its fruit and its goodness.\n\
      But when you entered, you defiled My land\nAnd made My heritage an abomination.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’\nAnd those who handle the\
      \ law did not know Me;\nThe rulers also transgressed against Me;\nThe prophets\
      \ prophesied by Baal,\nAnd walked after things that do not profit. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I will yet bring charges against you,” says the Lord,\n“And against\
      \ your children’s children I will bring charges.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For pass beyond the coasts of Cyprus and see,\nSend to Kedar and consider\
      \ diligently,\nAnd see if there has been such a thing.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation changed its gods,\nWhich are not gods?\nBut My people have\
      \ changed their Glory\nFor what does not profit.\n"
    12: "¹² Be astonished, O heavens, at this,\nAnd be horribly afraid;\nBe very desolate,”\
      \ says the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ “For My people have committed two evils:\nThey have forsaken Me, the fountain\
      \ of living waters,\nAnd hewn themselves cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold\
      \ no water. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Is Israel a servant?\nIs he a homeborn slave?\nWhy is he plundered?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The young lions roared at him, and growled;\nThey made his land waste;\n\
      His cities are burned, without inhabitant.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Also the people of Noph and Tahpanhes\nHave broken the crown of your head.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Have you not brought this on yourself,\nIn that you have forsaken the\
      \ Lord your God\nWhen He led you in the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And now why take the road to Egypt,\nTo drink the waters of Sihor?\nOr\
      \ why take the road to Assyria,\nTo drink the waters of the River?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your own wickedness will correct you,\nAnd your backslidings will rebuke\
      \ you.\nKnow therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing\nThat you\
      \ have forsaken the Lord your God,\nAnd the fear of Me is not in you,”\nSays\
      \ the Lord God of hosts. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “For of old I have broken your yoke and burst your bonds;\nAnd you said,\
      \ ‘I will not transgress,’\nWhen on every high hill and under every green tree\n\
      You lay down, playing the harlot.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I had planted you a noble vine, a seed of highest quality.\nHow then\
      \ have you turned before Me\nInto the degenerate plant of an alien vine?\n"
    22: "²² For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,\nYet your iniquity\
      \ is marked before Me,” says the Lord God. \n"
    23: "²³ “How can you say, ‘I am not polluted,\nI have not gone after the Baals’?\n\
      See your way in the valley;\nKnow what you have done:\nYou are a swift dromedary\
      \ breaking loose in her ways,\n"
    24: "²⁴ A wild donkey used to the wilderness,\nThat sniffs at the wind in her\
      \ desire;\nIn her time of mating, who can turn her away?\nAll those who seek\
      \ her will not weary themselves;\nIn her month they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst.\nBut\
      \ you said, ‘There is no hope.\nNo! For I have loved aliens, and after them\
      \ I will go.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “As the thief is ashamed when he is found out,\nSo is the house of Israel\
      \ ashamed;\nThey and their kings and their princes, and their priests and their\
      \ prophets,\n"
    27: "²⁷ Saying to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\nAnd to a stone, ‘You gave birth\
      \ to me.’\nFor they have turned their back to Me, and not their face.\nBut in\
      \ the time of their trouble\nThey will say, ‘Arise and save us.’\n"
    28: "²⁸ But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?\nLet them arise,\n\
      If they can save you in the time of your trouble;\nFor according to the number\
      \ of your cities\nAre your gods, O Judah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Why will you plead with Me?\nYou all have transgressed against Me,” says\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ “In vain I have chastened your children;\nThey received no correction.\n\
      Your sword has devoured your prophets\nLike a destroying lion. \n"
    31: "³¹ “O generation, see the word of the Lord!\nHave I been a wilderness to\
      \ Israel,\nOr a land of darkness?\nWhy do My people say, ‘We are lords;\nWe\
      \ will come no more to You’?\n"
    32: "³² Can a virgin forget her ornaments,\nOr a bride her attire?\nYet My people\
      \ have forgotten Me days without number. \n"
    33: "³³ “Why do you beautify your way to seek love?\nTherefore you have also taught\n\
      The wicked women your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Also on your skirts is found\nThe blood of the lives of the poor innocents.\n\
      I have not found it by secret search,\nBut plainly on all these things.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Yet you say, ‘Because I am innocent,\nSurely His anger shall turn from\
      \ me.’\nBehold, I will plead My case against you,\nBecause you say, ‘I have\
      \ not sinned.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Why do you gad about so much to change your way?\nAlso you shall be ashamed\
      \ of Egypt as you were ashamed of Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ Indeed you will go forth from him\nWith your hands on your head;\nFor\
      \ the Lord has rejected your trusted allies,\nAnd you will not prosper by them."
  3:
    1: "¹ “They say, ‘If a man divorces his wife,\nAnd she goes from him\nAnd becomes\
      \ another man’s,\nMay he return to her again?’\nWould not that land be greatly\
      \ polluted?\nBut you have played the harlot with many lovers;\nYet return to\
      \ Me,” says the Lord. \n"
    2: "² “Lift up your eyes to the desolate heights and see:\nWhere have you not\
      \ lain with men?\nBy the road you have sat for them\nLike an Arabian in the\
      \ wilderness;\nAnd you have polluted the land\nWith your harlotries and your\
      \ wickedness.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withheld,\nAnd there has been no latter\
      \ rain.\nYou have had a harlot’s forehead;\nYou refuse to be ashamed.\n"
    4: "⁴ Will you not from this time cry to Me,\n‘My Father, You are the guide of\
      \ my youth?\n"
    5: "⁵ Will He remain angry forever?\nWill He keep it to the end?’\nBehold, you\
      \ have spoken and done evil things,\nAs you were able.” \n"
    6: '⁶ The Lord said also to me in the days of Josiah the king: “Have you seen
      what backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and
      under every green tree, and there played the harlot. '
    7: '⁷ And I said, after she had done all these things, ‘Return to Me.’ But she
      did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ Then I saw that for all the causes for which backsliding Israel had committed
      adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce; yet her
      treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also. '
    9: '⁹ So it came to pass, through her casual harlotry, that she defiled the land
      and committed adultery with stones and trees. '
    10: "¹⁰ And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me\
      \ with her whole heart, but in pretense,” says the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous
      than treacherous Judah. '
    12: "¹² Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say:\n‘Return, backsliding\
      \ Israel,’ says the Lord;\n‘I will not cause My anger to fall on you.\nFor I\
      \ am merciful,’ says the Lord;\n‘I will not remain angry forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your iniquity,\nThat you have transgressed against the\
      \ Lord your God,\nAnd have scattered your charms\nTo alien deities under every\
      \ green tree,\nAnd you have not obeyed My voice,’ says the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Return, O backsliding children,” says the Lord; “for I am married to
      you. I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring
      you to Zion. '
    15: "¹⁵ And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who will feed you\
      \ with knowledge and understanding. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Then it shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in\
      \ the land in those days,” says the Lord, “that they will say no more, ‘The\
      \ ark of the covenant of the Lord.’ It shall not come to mind, nor shall they\
      \ remember it, nor shall they visit it, nor shall it be made anymore. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “At that time Jerusalem shall be called The Throne of the Lord, and all\
      \ the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem.\
      \ No more shall they follow the dictates of their evil hearts. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel,\
      \ and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that\
      \ I have given as an inheritance to your fathers. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “But I said:\n‘How can I put you among the children\nAnd give you a pleasant\
      \ land,\nA beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations?’\n“And I said:\n‘You\
      \ shall call Me, “My Father,”\nAnd not turn away from Me.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Surely, as a wife treacherously departs from her husband,\nSo have you\
      \ dealt treacherously with Me,\nO house of Israel,” says the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ A voice was heard on the desolate heights,\nWeeping and supplications\
      \ of the children of Israel.\nFor they have perverted their way;\nThey have\
      \ forgotten the Lord their God. \n"
    22: "²² “Return, you backsliding children,\nAnd I will heal your backslidings.”\
      \ \n“Indeed we do come to You,\nFor You are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Truly, in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills,\nAnd from the multitude\
      \ of mountains;\nTruly, in the Lord our God\nIs the salvation of Israel.\n"
    24: "²⁴ For shame has devoured\nThe labor of our fathers from our youth—\nTheir\
      \ flocks and their herds,\nTheir sons and their daughters.\n"
    25: "²⁵ We lie down in our shame,\nAnd our reproach covers us.\nFor we have sinned\
      \ against the Lord our God,\nWe and our fathers,\nFrom our youth even to this\
      \ day,\nAnd have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ “If you will return, O Israel,” says the Lord,\n“Return to Me;\nAnd if you\
      \ will put away your abominations out of My sight,\nThen you shall not be moved.\n"
    2: "² And you shall swear, ‘The Lord lives,’\nIn truth, in judgment, and in righteousness;\n\
      The nations shall bless themselves in Him,\nAnd in Him they shall glory.” \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:\n“Break up your\
      \ fallow ground,\nAnd do not sow among thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,\nAnd take away the foreskins of your\
      \ hearts,\nYou men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nLest My fury come\
      \ forth like fire,\nAnd burn so that no one can quench it,\nBecause of the evil\
      \ of your doings.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say:\n“Blow the trumpet\
      \ in the land;\nCry, ‘Gather together,’\nAnd say, ‘Assemble yourselves,\nAnd\
      \ let us go into the fortified cities.’\n"
    6: "⁶ Set up the standard toward Zion.\nTake refuge! Do not delay!\nFor I will\
      \ bring disaster from the north,\nAnd great destruction.” \n"
    7: "⁷ The lion has come up from his thicket,\nAnd the destroyer of nations is\
      \ on his way.\nHe has gone forth from his place\nTo make your land desolate.\n\
      Your cities will be laid waste,\nWithout inhabitant.\n"
    8: "⁸ For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth,\nLament and wail.\nFor the fierce\
      \ anger of the Lord\nHas not turned back from us. \n"
    9: "⁹ “And it shall come to pass in that day,” says the Lord,\n“That the heart\
      \ of the king shall perish,\nAnd the heart of the princes;\nThe priests shall\
      \ be astonished,\nAnd the prophets shall wonder.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God!\nSurely You have greatly deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem,\nSaying, ‘You shall have peace,’\nWhereas the sword reaches\
      \ to the heart.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ At that time it will be said\nTo this people and to Jerusalem,\n“A dry\
      \ wind of the desolate heights blows in the wilderness\nToward the daughter\
      \ of My people—\nNot to fan or to cleanse—\n"
    12: "¹² A wind too strong for these will come for Me;\nNow I will also speak judgment\
      \ against them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, he shall come up like clouds,\nAnd his chariots like a whirlwind.\n\
      His horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us, for we are plundered!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness,\nThat you may be saved.\n\
      How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For a voice declares from Dan\nAnd proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim:\n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Make mention to the nations,\nYes, proclaim against Jerusalem,\nThat\
      \ watchers come from a far country\nAnd raise their voice against the cities\
      \ of Judah.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Like keepers of a field they are against her all around,\nBecause she\
      \ has been rebellious against Me,” says the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Your ways and your doings\nHave procured these things for you.\nThis\
      \ is your wickedness,\nBecause it is bitter,\nBecause it reaches to your heart.”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ O my soul, my soul!\nI am pained in my very heart!\nMy heart makes a noise\
      \ in me;\nI cannot hold my peace,\nBecause you have heard, O my soul,\nThe sound\
      \ of the trumpet,\nThe alarm of war.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Destruction upon destruction is cried,\nFor the whole land is plundered.\n\
      Suddenly my tents are plundered,\nAnd my curtains in a moment.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long will I see the standard,\nAnd hear the sound of the trumpet?\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “For My people are foolish,\nThey have not known Me.\nThey are silly children,\n\
      And they have no understanding.\nThey are wise to do evil,\nBut to do good they\
      \ have no knowledge.” \n"
    23: "²³ I beheld the earth, and indeed it was without form, and void;\nAnd the\
      \ heavens, they had no light.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I beheld the mountains, and indeed they trembled,\nAnd all the hills moved\
      \ back and forth.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I beheld, and indeed there was no man,\nAnd all the birds of the heavens\
      \ had fled.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I beheld, and indeed the fruitful land was a wilderness,\nAnd all its\
      \ cities were broken down\nAt the presence of the Lord,\nBy His fierce anger.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ For thus says the Lord:\n“The whole land shall be desolate;\nYet I will\
      \ not make a full end.\n"
    28: "²⁸ For this shall the earth mourn,\nAnd the heavens above be black,\nBecause\
      \ I have spoken.\nI have purposed and will not relent,\nNor will I turn back\
      \ from it.\n"
    29: "²⁹ The whole city shall flee from the noise of the horsemen and bowmen.\n\
      They shall go into thickets and climb up on the rocks.\nEvery city shall be\
      \ forsaken,\nAnd not a man shall dwell in it. \n"
    30: "³⁰ “And when you are plundered,\nWhat will you do?\nThough you clothe yourself\
      \ with crimson,\nThough you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold,\nThough you\
      \ enlarge your eyes with paint,\nIn vain you will make yourself fair;\nYour\
      \ lovers will despise you;\nThey will seek your life. \n"
    31: "³¹ “For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor,\nThe anguish as of her\
      \ who brings forth her first child,\nThe voice of the daughter of Zion bewailing\
      \ herself;\nShe spreads her hands, saying,\n‘Woe is me now, for my soul is weary\n\
      Because of murderers!’"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem;\nSee now and know;\nAnd\
      \ seek in her open places\nIf you can find a man,\nIf there is anyone who executes\
      \ judgment,\nWho seeks the truth,\nAnd I will pardon her.\n"
    2: "² Though they say, ‘As the Lord lives,’\nSurely they swear falsely.” \n"
    3: "³ O Lord, are not Your eyes on the truth?\nYou have stricken them,\nBut they\
      \ have not grieved;\nYou have consumed them,\nBut they have refused to receive\
      \ correction.\nThey have made their faces harder than rock;\nThey have refused\
      \ to return. \n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore I said, “Surely these are poor.\nThey are foolish;\nFor they do\
      \ not know the way of the Lord,\nThe judgment of their God.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will go to the great men and speak to them,\nFor they have known the way\
      \ of the Lord,\nThe judgment of their God.” \nBut these have altogether broken\
      \ the yoke\nAnd burst the bonds.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion from the forest shall slay them,\nA wolf of the deserts\
      \ shall destroy them;\nA leopard will watch over their cities.\nEveryone who\
      \ goes out from there shall be torn in pieces,\nBecause their transgressions\
      \ are many;\nTheir backslidings have increased. \n"
    7: "⁷ “How shall I pardon you for this?\nYour children have forsaken Me\nAnd sworn\
      \ by those that are not gods.\nWhen I had fed them to the full,\nThen they committed\
      \ adultery\nAnd assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.\n"
    8: "⁸ They were like well-fed lusty stallions;\nEvery one neighed after his neighbor’s\
      \ wife.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things?” says the Lord.\n“And shall I\
      \ not avenge Myself on such a nation as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go up on her walls and destroy,\nBut do not make a complete end.\nTake\
      \ away her branches,\nFor they are not the Lord’s.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the house of Israel and the house of Judah\nHave dealt very treacherously\
      \ with Me,” says the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² They have lied about the Lord,\nAnd said, “It is not He.\nNeither will\
      \ evil come upon us,\nNor shall we see sword or famine.\n"
    13: "¹³ And the prophets become wind,\nFor the word is not in them.\nThus shall\
      \ it be done to them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts:\n“Because you speak this word,\n\
      Behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire,\nAnd this people wood,\nAnd\
      \ it shall devour them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, I will bring a nation against you from afar,\nO house of Israel,”\

    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the

    4: '⁴ which I commanded your fathers in the day I brought them out of the land
      of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and do according to

    6: '⁶ Then the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: ‘Hear the words of this covenant and
      do them. '
    7: '⁷ For I earnestly exhorted your fathers in the day I brought them up out of

    8: "⁸ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone followed the dictates\

    9: '⁹ And the Lord said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah

    10: "¹⁰ They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused\

    14: "¹⁴ “So do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them;\

    4: "⁴ How long will the land mourn,\nAnd the herbs of every field wither?\nThe\

    6: "⁶ For even your brothers, the house of your father,\nEven they have dealt\

    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the Lord: “Against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance

    5: "⁵ So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now it came to pass after many days that the Lord said to me, “Arise, go

    16: "¹⁶ Your words were found, and I ate them,\nAnd Your word was to me the joy\
      \ and rejoicing of my heart;\nFor I am called by Your name,\nO Lord God of hosts.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers,\nNor did I rejoice;\nI sat\
      \ alone because of Your hand,\nFor You have filled me with indignation.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why is my pain perpetual\nAnd my wound incurable,\nWhich refuses to be\
      \ healed?\nWill You surely be to me like an unreliable stream,\nAs waters that\
      \ fail? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Therefore thus says the Lord:\n“If you return,\nThen I will bring you\
      \ back;\nYou shall stand before Me;\nIf you take out the precious from the vile,\n\
      You shall be as My mouth.\nLet them return to you,\nBut you must not return\
      \ to them.\n"
    20: "²⁰ And I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall;\nAnd they\
      \ will fight against you,\nBut they shall not prevail against you;\nFor I am\
      \ with you to save you\nAnd deliver you,” says the Lord.\n"
    21: "²¹ “I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked,\nAnd I will redeem you\
      \ from the grip of the terrible.”"
  16:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord also came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this
      place.” '
    3: '³ For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in
      this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them and their fathers who
      begot them in this land: '
    4: "⁴ “They shall die gruesome deaths; they shall not be lamented nor shall they\
      \ be buried, but they shall be like refuse on the face of the earth. They shall\
      \ be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be meat for\
      \ the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth.” \n"
    5: '⁵ For thus says the Lord: “Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament
      or bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people,” says the Lord,
      “lovingkindness and mercies. '
    6: '⁶ Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried;
      neither shall men lament for them, cut themselves, nor make themselves bald
      for them. '
    7: '⁷ Nor shall men break bread in mourning for them, to comfort them for the
      dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father
      or their mother. '
    8: "⁸ Also you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat\
      \ and drink.” \n"
    9: "⁹ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will cause\
      \ to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of\
      \ mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice\
      \ of the bride. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “And it shall be, when you show this people all these words, and they
      say to you, ‘Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us?
      Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against the
      Lord our God?’ '
    11: '¹¹ then you shall say to them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken Me,’ says
      the Lord; ‘they have walked after other gods and have served them and worshiped
      them, and have forsaken Me and not kept My law. '
    12: '¹² And you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, each one follows
      the dictates of his own evil heart, so that no one listens to Me. '
    13: "¹³ Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not\
      \ know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day\
      \ and night, where I will not show you favor.’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “that it shall
      no more be said, ‘The Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from
      the land of Egypt,’ '
    15: "¹⁵ but, ‘The Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land\
      \ of the north and from all the lands where He had driven them.’ For I will\
      \ bring them back into their land which I gave to their fathers. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says the Lord, “and they shall
      fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them
      from every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. '
    17: '¹⁷ For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor
      is their iniquity hidden from My eyes. '
    18: "¹⁸ And first I will repay double for their iniquity and their sin, because\
      \ they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses\
      \ of their detestable and abominable idols.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ O Lord, my strength and my fortress,\nMy refuge in the day of affliction,\n\
      The Gentiles shall come to You\nFrom the ends of the earth and say,\n“Surely\
      \ our fathers have inherited lies,\nWorthlessness and unprofitable things.”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Will a man make gods for himself,\nWhich are not gods? \n"
    21: "²¹ “Therefore behold, I will this once cause them to know,\nI will cause\
      \ them to know\nMy hand and My might;\nAnd they shall know that My name is the\
      \ Lord."
  17:
    1: "¹ “The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron;\nWith the point of a diamond\

    2: "² While their children remember\nTheir altars and their wooden images\nBy\

    3: "³ O My mountain in the field,\nI will give as plunder your wealth, all your\

    4: "⁴ And you, even yourself,\nShall let go of your heritage which I gave you;\n\
      And I will cause you to serve your enemies\nIn the land which you do not know;\n\

    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord:\n“Cursed is the man who trusts in man\nAnd makes flesh\

    7: "⁷ “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,\nAnd whose hope is the Lord.\n"
    8: "⁸ For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters,\nWhich spreads out its\

      \ from yielding fruit. \n"
    9: "⁹ “The heart is deceitful above all things,\nAnd desperately wicked;\nWho\
      \ can know it?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I, the Lord, search the heart,\nI test the mind,\nEven to give every man\

    11: "¹¹ “As a partridge that broods but does not hatch,\nSo is he who gets riches,\

    12: "¹² A glorious high throne from the beginning\nIs the place of our sanctuary.\n"
    13: "¹³ O Lord, the hope of Israel,\nAll who forsake You shall be ashamed. \n\

    15: "¹⁵ Indeed they say to me,\n“Where is the word of the Lord?\nLet it come now!”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You,\n\

    19: '¹⁹ Thus the Lord said to me: “Go and stand in the gate of the children of

    22: '²² nor carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work,
      but hallow the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. '
    23: "²³ But they did not obey nor incline their ear, but made their neck stiff,\

    24: '²⁴ “And it shall be, if you heed Me carefully,” says the Lord, “to bring
      no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but hallow the

    27: ²⁷ “But if you will not heed Me to hallow the Sabbath day, such as not carrying
      a burden when entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will

  18:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying: '
    2: '² “Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to

    3: '³ Then I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something
      at the wheel. '
    4: "⁴ And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter;\

      up, to pull down, and to destroy it, '
    8: '⁸ if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent

    10: "¹⁰ if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice, then I\

  19:
    1: '¹ Thus says the Lord: “Go and get a potter’s earthen flask, and take some
      of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests. '

    5: '⁵ (they have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire
      for burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or speak, nor did it come
      into My mind), '
    6: '⁶ therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “that this place
      shall no more be called Tophet or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley
      of Slaughter. '
    7: '⁷ And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and
      I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands
      of those who seek their lives; their corpses I will give as meat for the birds
      of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. '
    8: '⁸ I will make this city desolate and a hissing; everyone who passes by it
      will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. '
    9: "⁹ And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their\

    12: '¹² Thus I will do to this place,” says the Lord, “and to its inhabitants,

    4: '⁴ For thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and

    5: '⁵ Moreover I will deliver all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and
      all its precious things; all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give

    7: "⁷ O Lord, You induced me, and I was persuaded;\nYou are stronger than I, and\
      \ have prevailed.\nI am in derision daily;\nEveryone mocks me.\n"
    8: "⁸ For when I spoke, I cried out;\nI shouted, “Violence and plunder!”\nBecause\
      \ the word of the Lord was made to me\nA reproach and a derision daily.\n"
    9: "⁹ Then I said, “I will not make mention of Him,\nNor speak anymore in His\
      \ name.”\nBut His word was in my heart like a burning fire\nShut up in my bones;\n\
      I was weary of holding it back,\nAnd I could not.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For I heard many mocking:\n“Fear on every side!”\n“Report,” they say,\
      \ “and we will report it!”\nAll my acquaintances watched for my stumbling, saying,\n\
      “Perhaps he can be induced;\nThen we will prevail against him,\nAnd we will\
      \ take our revenge on him.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Lord is with me as a mighty, awesome One.\nTherefore my persecutors\
      \ will stumble, and will not prevail.\nThey will be greatly ashamed, for they\
      \ will not prosper.\nTheir everlasting confusion will never be forgotten.\n"
    12: "¹² But, O Lord of hosts,\nYou who test the righteous,\nAnd see the mind and\

      \ You. \n"
    13: "¹³ Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord!\nFor He has delivered the life of the\

      \ not relent;\nLet him hear the cry in the morning\nAnd the shouting at noon,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Because he did not kill me from the womb,\nThat my mother might have been\
      \ my grave,\nAnd her womb always enlarged with me.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow,\nThat my days\

  21:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to

      \ Lord;\n“I will kindle a fire in its forest,\nAnd it shall devour all things\
      \ around it.” ’ ”"
  22:
    1: '¹ Thus says the Lord: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there
      speak this word, '
    2: '² and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, you who sit on the
      throne of David, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates! '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord: “Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver the
      plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong and do no violence to
      the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this
      place. '
    4: '⁴ For if you indeed do this thing, then shall enter the gates of this house,
      riding on horses and in chariots, accompanied by servants and people, kings
      who sit on the throne of David. '
    5: "⁵ But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself,” says the Lord,\
      \ “that this house shall become a desolation.” ’ ” \n"
    6: "⁶ For thus says the Lord to the house of the king of Judah:\n“You are Gilead\
      \ to Me,\nThe head of Lebanon;\nYet I surely will make you a wilderness,\nCities\
      \ which are not inhabited.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will prepare destroyers against you,\nEveryone with his weapons;\nThey\
      \ shall cut down your choice cedars\nAnd cast them into the fire. \n"
    8: '⁸ And many nations will pass by this city; and everyone will say to his neighbor,
      ‘Why has the Lord done so to this great city?’ '
    9: "⁹ Then they will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord\
      \ their God, and worshiped other gods and served them.’ ” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Weep not for the dead, nor bemoan him;\nWeep bitterly for him who goes\
      \ away,\nFor he shall return no more,\nNor see his native country. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went from this place: “He shall
      not return here anymore, '
    12: "¹² but he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall\
      \ see this land no more. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness\nAnd his chambers\
      \ by injustice,\nWho uses his neighbor’s service without wages\nAnd gives him\
      \ nothing for his work,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house with spacious chambers,\n\
      And cut out windows for it,\nPaneling it with cedar\nAnd painting it with vermilion.’\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Shall you reign because you enclose yourself in cedar?\nDid not your\
      \ father eat and drink,\nAnd do justice and righteousness?\nThen it was well\
      \ with him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He judged the cause of the poor and needy;\nThen it was well.\nWas not\
      \ this knowing Me?” says the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Yet your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your covetousness,\n\
      For shedding innocent blood,\nAnd practicing oppression and violence.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king\
      \ of Judah:\n“They shall not lament for him,\nSaying, ‘Alas, my brother!’ or\
      \ ‘Alas, my sister!’\nThey shall not lament for him,\nSaying, ‘Alas, master!’\
      \ or ‘Alas, his glory!’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey,\nDragged and cast out\
      \ beyond the gates of Jerusalem. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,\nAnd lift up your voice in Bashan;\nCry\
      \ from Abarim,\nFor all your lovers are destroyed.\n"
    21: "²¹ I spoke to you in your prosperity,\nBut you said, ‘I will not hear.’\n\
      This has been your manner from your youth,\nThat you did not obey My voice.\n"
    22: "²² The wind shall eat up all your rulers,\nAnd your lovers shall go into\
      \ captivity;\nSurely then you will be ashamed and humiliated\nFor all your wickedness.\n"
    23: "²³ O inhabitant of Lebanon,\nMaking your nest in the cedars,\nHow gracious\
      \ will you be when pangs come upon you,\nLike the pain of a woman in labor?\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ “As I live,” says the Lord, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king
      of Judah, were the signet on My right hand, yet I would pluck you off; '
    25: '²⁵ and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into
      the hand of those whose face you fear—the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
      and the hand of the Chaldeans. '
    26: '²⁶ So I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country
      where you were not born; and there you shall die. '
    27: "²⁷ But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “Is this man Coniah a despised, broken idol—\nA vessel in which is no\
      \ pleasure?\nWhy are they cast out, he and his descendants,\nAnd cast into a\
      \ land which they do not know?\n"
    29: "²⁹ O earth, earth, earth,\nHear the word of the Lord!\n"
    30: "³⁰ Thus says the Lord:\n‘Write this man down as childless,\nA man who shall\

  23:
    1: '¹ “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!”
      says the Lord. '
    2: '² Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel against the shepherds who feed
      My people: “You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and not attended
      to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings,” says the
      Lord. '
    3: '³ “But I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries where I
      have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful
      and increase. '
    4: "⁴ I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they shall fear\
      \ no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall they be lacking,” says the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord,\n“That I will raise to David\
      \ a Branch of righteousness;\nA King shall reign and prosper,\nAnd execute judgment\
      \ and righteousness in the earth.\n"
    6: "⁶ In His days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Israel will dwell safely;\nNow this\
      \ is His name by which He will be called:\nTHE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “that they shall
      no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from
      the land of Egypt,’ '
    8: "⁸ but, ‘As the Lord lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house\
      \ of Israel from the north country and from all the countries where I had driven\
      \ them.’ And they shall dwell in their own land.” \n"
    9: "⁹ My heart within me is broken\nBecause of the prophets;\nAll my bones shake.\n\
      I am like a drunken man,\nAnd like a man whom wine has overcome,\nBecause of\
      \ the Lord,\nAnd because of His holy words.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the land is full of adulterers;\nFor because of a curse the land mourns.\n\
      The pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up.\nTheir course of life is\
      \ evil,\nAnd their might is not right. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “For both prophet and priest are profane;\nYes, in My house I have found\
      \ their wickedness,” says the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore their way shall be to them\nLike slippery ways;\nIn the darkness\

      The year of their punishment,” says the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ “And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria:\nThey prophesied by\
      \ Baal\nAnd caused My people Israel to err.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Also I have seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem:\nThey\
      \ commit adultery and walk in lies;\nThey also strengthen the hands of evildoers,\n\
      So that no one turns back from his wickedness.\nAll of them are like Sodom to\
      \ Me,\nAnd her inhabitants like Gomorrah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets:\n‘Behold,\

      For from the prophets of Jerusalem\nProfaneness has gone out into all the land.’\
      \ ” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n“Do not listen to the words of the prophets\

    18: "¹⁸ For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord,\nAnd has perceived and heard\

    21: "²¹ “I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran.\nI have not spoken to them,\

    22: "²² But if they had stood in My counsel,\nAnd had caused My people to hear\
      \ My words,\nThen they would have turned them from their evil way\nAnd from\
      \ the evil of their doings. \n"
    23: "²³ “Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord,\n“And not a God afar off?\n"

      \ the Lord;\n“Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name,
      saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ '
    26: '²⁶ How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies?
      Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart, '
    27: "²⁷ who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone\
      \ tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream;\nAnd he who has My\
      \ word, let him speak My word faithfully.\nWhat is the chaff to the wheat?”\
      \ says the Lord.\n"
    29: "²⁹ “Is not My word like a fire?” says the Lord,\n“And like a hammer that\
      \ breaks the rock in pieces? \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says the Lord, “who steal
      My words every one from his neighbor. '
    31: '³¹ Behold, I am against the prophets,” says the Lord, “who use their tongues
      and say, ‘He says.’ '
    32: "³² Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” says the Lord,\
      \ “and tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies and by their recklessness.\
      \ Yet I did not send them or command them; therefore they shall not profit this\
      \ people at all,” says the Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ “So when these people or the prophet or the priest ask you, saying, ‘What
      is the oracle of the Lord?’ you shall then say to them, ‘What oracle?’ I will
      even forsake you,” says the Lord. '
    34: '³⁴ “And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, ‘The oracle
      of the Lord!’ I will even punish that man and his house. '
    35: '³⁵ Thus every one of you shall say to his neighbor, and every one to his
      brother, ‘What has the Lord answered?’ and, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    36: '³⁶ And the oracle of the Lord you shall mention no more. For every man’s
      word will be his oracle, for you have perverted the words of the living God,
      the Lord of hosts, our God. '
    37: '³⁷ Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the Lord answered you?’ and,
      ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    38: '³⁸ But since you say, ‘The oracle of the Lord!’ therefore thus says the Lord:
      ‘Because you say this word, “The oracle of the Lord!” and I have sent to you,
      saying, “Do not say, ‘The oracle of the Lord!’ ” '
    39: '³⁹ therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you and forsake you,
      and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame,
      which shall not be forgotten.’ ”
  24:
    1: '¹ The Lord showed me, and there were two baskets of figs set before the temple

      the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen
      and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. '
    2: '² One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; and the
      other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten, they were so bad. '
    3: "³ Then the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”\nAnd I said, “Figs,\
      \ the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, they\

    4: '⁴ Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Like these good figs, so will I

      out of this place for their own good, into the land of the Chaldeans. '
    6: '⁶ For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this
      land; I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not
      pluck them up. '
    7: "⁷ Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord; and they shall\
      \ be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their\
      \ whole heart. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘And as the bad figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad’—surely thus
      says the Lord—‘so will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the
      residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land
      of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ I will deliver them to trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth, for their
      harm, to be a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all places where
      I shall drive them. '
    10: ¹⁰ And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till
      they are consumed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’ ”
  25:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the
      fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first
      year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), '
    2: '² which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: '
    3: '³ “From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even
      to this day, this is the twenty-third year in which the word of the Lord has
      come to me; and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have
      not listened. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early
      and sending them, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear. '
    5: '⁵ They said, ‘Repent now everyone of his evil way and his evil doings, and
      dwell in the land that the Lord has given to you and your fathers forever and
      ever. '
    6: '⁶ Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke
      Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.’ '
    7: "⁷ Yet you have not listened to Me,” says the Lord, “that you might provoke\
      \ Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘Because you have not heard My words, '
    9: '⁹ behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ says the Lord,
      ‘and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against
      this land, against its inhabitants, and against these nations all around, and
      will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual
      desolations. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
      the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones
      and the light of the lamp. '
    11: "¹¹ And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment, and these\

    12: '¹² ‘Then it will come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will

      iniquity,’ says the Lord; ‘and I will make it a perpetual desolation. '
    13: '¹³ So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against
      it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning
      all the nations. '
    14: "¹⁴ (For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also; and I\

    17: '¹⁷ Then I took the cup from the Lord’s hand, and made all the nations drink,

    33: "³³ And at that day the slain of the Lord shall be from one end of the earth\

    13: '¹³ Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of
      the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent concerning the doom that He has
      pronounced against you. '
    14: '¹⁴ As for me, here I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and proper
      to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring\
      \ innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly\
      \ the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets,\
      \ “This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of\
      \ the Lord our God.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly
      of the people, saying: '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,\
      \ and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n\
      “Zion shall be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem shall become heaps of ruins,\n\
      And the mountain of the temple\nLike the bare hills of the forest.” ’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death? Did he\
      \ not fear the Lord and seek the Lord’s favor? And the Lord relented concerning\
      \ the doom which He had pronounced against them. But we are doing great evil\
      \ against ourselves.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah
      the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and
      against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. '
    21: '²¹ And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes,
      heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard
      it, he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor,
      and other men who went with him to Egypt. '
    23: "²³ And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king,\
      \ who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the\
      \ common people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so
      that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord to me: ‘Make for yourselves bonds and yokes, and put
      them on your neck, '
    3: '³ and send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites,
      the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come
      to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ And command them to say to their masters, “Thus says the Lord of hosts,
      the God of Israel—thus you shall say to your masters: '
    5: '⁵ ‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are on the ground, by
      My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed
      proper to Me. '
    6: '⁶ And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the
      king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field I have also given him
      to serve him. '
    7: '⁷ So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son’s son, until the
      time of his land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him
      serve them. '
    8: '⁸ And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar
      the king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king
      of Babylon, that nation I will punish,’ says the Lord, ‘with the sword, the
      famine, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers,
      your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not
      serve the king of Babylon.” '
    10: '¹⁰ For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and
      I will drive you out, and you will perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon\
      \ and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,’ says the Lord, ‘and\
      \ they shall till it and dwell in it.’ ” ’ ” \n"
    12: '¹² I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying,
      “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his
      people, and live! '
    13: '¹³ Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and
      by the pestilence, as the Lord has spoken against the nation that will not serve
      the king of Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you,
      saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to
      you; '
    15: "¹⁵ for I have not sent them,” says the Lord, “yet they prophesy a lie in\
      \ My name, that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you and the prophets\
      \ who prophesy to you.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says
      the Lord: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you,
      saying, “Behold, the vessels of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought
      back from Babylon”; for they prophesy a lie to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should
      this city be laid waste? '
    18: "¹⁸ But if they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, let\
      \ them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are\
      \ left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem,\
      \ do not go to Babylon.’ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the
      Sea, concerning the carts, and concerning the remainder of the vessels that
      remain in this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away
      captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon,
      and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— '
    21: '²¹ yes, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels
      that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah
      and of Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² ‘They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day
      that I visit them,’ says the Lord. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them
      to this place.’ ”
  28:
    1: '¹ And it happened in the same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah
      king of Judah, in the fourth year and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the
      son of Azur the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the
      Lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ‘I have broken
      the yoke of the king of Babylon. '
    3: '³ Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of
      the Lord’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place
      and carried to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king\
      \ of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,’ says the Lord,\
      \ ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence
      of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house
      of the Lord, '
    6: '⁶ and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! The Lord do so; the Lord perform your
      words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Lord’s house
      and all who were carried away captive, from Babylon to this place. '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the
      hearing of all the people: '
    8: '⁸ The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against
      many countries and great kingdoms—of war and disaster and pestilence. '
    9: "⁹ As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet\
      \ comes to pass, the prophet will be known as one whom the Lord has truly sent.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck
      and broke it. '
    11: "¹¹ And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says\
      \ the Lord: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\
      \ from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.’ ” And the\
      \ prophet Jeremiah went his way. \n"
    12: '¹² Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet
      had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Go and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “You have broken the
      yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.” '
    14: "¹⁴ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “I have put a yoke\
      \ of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. I have given him the beasts of\
      \ the field also.” ’ ” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Hear now, Hananiah,
      the Lord has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will cast you from the face of\
      \ the earth. This year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against\
      \ the Lord.’ ” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
  29:
    1: '¹ Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from
      Jerusalem to the remainder of the elders who were carried away captive—to the
      priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away
      captive from Jerusalem to Babylon. '
    2: '² (This happened after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the
      princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from
      Jerusalem.) '
    3: "³ The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah\
      \ the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon, saying, \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who were carried\
      \ away captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit. '
    6: '⁶ Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and
      give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters—that
      you may be increased there, and not diminished. '
    7: '⁷ And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away
      captive, and pray to the Lord for it; for in its peace you will have peace. '
    8: '⁸ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets
      and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams
      which you cause to be dreamed. '
    9: "⁹ For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For thus says the Lord: After seventy years are completed at Babylon,
      I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to return
      to this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts
      of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. '
    12: '¹² Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to
      you. '
    13: '¹³ And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your
      heart. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back from\
      \ your captivity; I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places\
      \ where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you to the place\
      \ from which I cause you to be carried away captive. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Because you have said, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon”— '
    16: '¹⁶ therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne
      of David, concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your
      brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity— '
    17: '¹⁷ thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the
      famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that cannot
      be eaten, they are so bad. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence;
      and I will deliver them to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth—to be
      a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where
      I have driven them, '
    19: '¹⁹ because they have not heeded My words, says the Lord, which I sent to
      them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; neither
      would you heed, says the Lord. '
    20: "²⁰ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all you of the captivity, whom I\
      \ have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon. \n"
    21: '²¹ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son
      of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My
      name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      and he shall slay them before your eyes. '
    22: '²² And because of them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of
      Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab,
      whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire”; '
    23: "²³ because they have done disgraceful things in Israel, have committed adultery\
      \ with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which\
      \ I have not commanded them. Indeed I know, and am a witness, says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You have sent
      letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, to Zephaniah the
      son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that
      there should be officers in the house of the Lord over every man who is demented
      and considers himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison and in the
      stocks. '
    27: '²⁷ Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes
      himself a prophet to you? '
    28: "²⁸ For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘This captivity is long; build\
      \ houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’ ” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the
      prophet. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: '
    31: '³¹ Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the Lord concerning
      Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have
      not sent him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie— '
    32: '³² therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite
      and his family: he shall not have anyone to dwell among this people, nor shall
      he see the good that I will do for My people, says the Lord, because he has
      taught rebellion against the Lord.'
  30:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel, saying: ‘Write in a book for yourself
      all the words that I have spoken to you. '
    3: "³ For behold, the days are coming,’ says the Lord, ‘that I will bring back\
      \ from captivity My people Israel and Judah,’ says the Lord. ‘And I will cause\
      \ them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess\
      \ it.’ ” \n"
    4: "⁴ Now these are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ “For thus says the Lord:\n‘We have heard a voice of trembling,\nOf fear,\
      \ and not of peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask now, and see,\nWhether a man is ever in labor with child?\nSo why do\
      \ I see every man with his hands on his loins\nLike a woman in labor,\nAnd all\
      \ faces turned pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ Alas! For that day is great,\nSo that none is like it;\nAnd it is the time\
      \ of Jacob’s trouble,\nBut he shall be saved out of it. \n"
    8: "⁸ ‘For it shall come to pass in that day,’\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n‘That\
      \ I will break his yoke from your neck,\nAnd will burst your bonds;\nForeigners\
      \ shall no more enslave them.\n"
    9: "⁹ But they shall serve the Lord their God,\nAnd David their king,\nWhom I\
      \ will raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ ‘Therefore do not fear, O My servant Jacob,’ says the Lord,\n‘Nor be dismayed,\
      \ O Israel;\nFor behold, I will save you from afar,\nAnd your seed from the\
      \ land of their captivity.\nJacob shall return, have rest and be quiet,\nAnd\
      \ no one shall make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you,’ says the Lord, ‘to save you;\nThough I make a full\
      \ end of all nations where I have scattered you,\nYet I will not make a complete\
      \ end of you.\nBut I will correct you in justice,\nAnd will not let you go altogether\
      \ unpunished.’ \n"
    12: "¹² “For thus says the Lord:\n‘Your affliction is incurable,\nYour wound is\
      \ severe.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is no one to plead your cause,\nThat you may be bound up;\nYou have\
      \ no healing medicines.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers have forgotten you;\nThey do not seek you;\nFor I have\
      \ wounded you with the wound of an enemy,\nWith the chastisement of a cruel\
      \ one,\nFor the multitude of your iniquities,\nBecause your sins have increased.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry about your affliction?\nYour sorrow is incurable.\nBecause\
      \ of the multitude of your iniquities,\nBecause your sins have increased,\n\
      I have done these things to you. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured;\nAnd all your adversaries,\
      \ every one of them, shall go into captivity;\nThose who plunder you shall become\
      \ plunder,\nAnd all who prey upon you I will make a prey.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore health to you\nAnd heal you of your wounds,’ says the\
      \ Lord,\n‘Because they called you an outcast saying:\n“This is Zion;\nNo one\
      \ seeks her.” ’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Thus says the Lord:\n‘Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob’s\
      \ tents,\nAnd have mercy on his dwelling places;\nThe city shall be built upon\
      \ its own mound,\nAnd the palace shall remain according to its own plan.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then out of them shall proceed thanksgiving\nAnd the voice of those who\
      \ make merry;\nI will multiply them, and they shall not diminish;\nI will also\
      \ glorify them, and they shall not be small.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children also shall be as before,\nAnd their congregation shall\
      \ be established before Me;\nAnd I will punish all who oppress them.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their nobles shall be from among them,\nAnd their governor shall come\
      \ from their midst;\nThen I will cause him to draw near,\nAnd he shall approach\
      \ Me;\nFor who is this who pledged his heart to approach Me?’ says the Lord.\n"
    22: "²² ‘You shall be My people,\nAnd I will be your God.’ ” \n"
    23: "²³ Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord\nGoes forth with fury,\nA continuing\
      \ whirlwind;\nIt will fall violently on the head of the wicked.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The fierce anger of the Lord will not return until He has done it,\nAnd\
      \ until He has performed the intents of His heart. \nIn the latter days you\
      \ will consider it."
  31:
    1: "¹ “At the same time,” says the Lord, “I will be the God of all the families\
      \ of Israel, and they shall be My people.” \n"
    2: "² Thus says the Lord:\n“The people who survived the sword\nFound grace in\
      \ the wilderness—\nIsrael, when I went to give him rest.” \n"
    3: "³ The Lord has appeared of old to me, saying:\n“Yes, I have loved you with\
      \ an everlasting love;\nTherefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.\n"
    4: "⁴ Again I will build you, and you shall be rebuilt,\nO virgin of Israel!\n\
      You shall again be adorned with your tambourines,\nAnd shall go forth in the\
      \ dances of those who rejoice.\n"
    5: "⁵ You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria;\nThe planters shall\
      \ plant and eat them as ordinary food.\n"
    6: "⁶ For there shall be a day\nWhen the watchmen will cry on Mount Ephraim,\n\
      ‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion,\nTo the Lord our God.’ ” \n"
    7: "⁷ For thus says the Lord:\n“Sing with gladness for Jacob,\nAnd shout among\
      \ the chief of the nations;\nProclaim, give praise, and say,\n‘O Lord, save\
      \ Your people,\nThe remnant of Israel!’\n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will bring them from the north country,\nAnd gather them from\
      \ the ends of the earth,\nAmong them the blind and the lame,\nThe woman with\
      \ child\nAnd the one who labors with child, together;\nA great throng shall\
      \ return there.\n"
    9: "⁹ They shall come with weeping,\nAnd with supplications I will lead them.\n\
      I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters,\nIn a straight way in which\
      \ they shall not stumble;\nFor I am a Father to Israel,\nAnd Ephraim is My firstborn.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,\nAnd declare it in the isles afar\

    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has redeemed Jacob,\nAnd ransomed him from the hand of one\
      \ stronger than he.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,\nStreaming to\
      \ the goodness of the Lord—\nFor wheat and new wine and oil,\nFor the young\
      \ of the flock and the herd;\nTheir souls shall be like a well-watered garden,\n\
      And they shall sorrow no more at all. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance,\nAnd the young men and the\
      \ old, together;\nFor I will turn their mourning to joy,\nWill comfort them,\n\
      And make them rejoice rather than sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will satiate the soul of the priests with abundance,\nAnd My people\
      \ shall be satisfied with My goodness, says the Lord.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thus says the Lord:\n“A voice was heard in Ramah,\nLamentation and bitter\

      \ children,\nBecause they are no more.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus says the Lord:\n“Refrain your voice from weeping,\nAnd your eyes\

      \ come back from the land of the enemy.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There is hope in your future, says the Lord,\nThat your children shall\
      \ come back to their own border. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself:\n‘You have chastised me,\
      \ and I was chastised,\nLike an untrained bull;\nRestore me, and I will return,\n\
      For You are the Lord my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Surely, after my turning, I repented;\nAnd after I was instructed, I struck\
      \ myself on the thigh;\nI was ashamed, yes, even humiliated,\nBecause I bore\
      \ the reproach of my youth.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim My dear son?\nIs he a pleasant child?\nFor though I spoke against\
      \ him,\nI earnestly remember him still;\nTherefore My heart yearns for him;\n\
      I will surely have mercy on him, says the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ “Set up signposts,\nMake landmarks;\nSet your heart toward the highway,\n\
      The way in which you went.\nTurn back, O virgin of Israel,\nTurn back to these\
      \ your cities.\n"
    22: "²² How long will you gad about,\nO you backsliding daughter?\nFor the Lord\
      \ has created a new thing in the earth—\nA woman shall encompass a man.” \n"
    23: '²³ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “They shall again use
      this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I bring back their
      captivity: ‘The Lord bless you, O home of justice, and mountain of holiness!’ '
    24: '²⁴ And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all its cities together,
      farmers and those going out with flocks. '
    25: "²⁵ For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful\
      \ soul.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ After this I awoke and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, that I will sow the house
      of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. '
    28: '²⁸ And it shall come to pass, that as I have watched over them to pluck up,
      to break down, to throw down, to destroy, and to afflict, so I will watch over
      them to build and to plant, says the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ In those days they shall say no more:\n‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,\n\
      And the children’s teeth are set on edge.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man who eats the sour\
      \ grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant
      with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah— '
    32: '³² not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
      that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant
      which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the Lord. '
    33: '³³ But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
      those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on
      their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. '
    34: "³⁴ No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother,\
      \ saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they all shall know Me, from the least of them\
      \ to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity,\
      \ and their sin I will remember no more.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ Thus says the Lord,\nWho gives the sun for a light by day,\nThe ordinances\
      \ of the moon and the stars for a light by night,\nWho disturbs the sea,\nAnd\
      \ its waves roar\n(The Lord of hosts is His name): \n"
    36: "³⁶ “If those ordinances depart\nFrom before Me, says the Lord,\nThen the\
      \ seed of Israel shall also cease\nFrom being a nation before Me forever.” \n"
    37: "³⁷ Thus says the Lord:\n“If heaven above can be measured,\nAnd the foundations\
      \ of the earth searched out beneath,\nI will also cast off all the seed of Israel\n\
      For all that they have done, says the Lord. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, that the city shall be built
      for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. '
    39: '³⁹ The surveyor’s line shall again extend straight forward over the hill
      Gareb; then it shall turn toward Goath. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields
      as far as the Brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east,
      shall be holy to the Lord. It shall not be plucked up or thrown down anymore
      forever.”
  32:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah
      king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: '² For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the
      prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah’s
      house. '
    3: '³ For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy
      and say, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of
      the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; '
    4: '⁴ and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans,
      but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall
      speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye; '
    5: "⁵ then he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit\
      \ him,” says the Lord; “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed”\
      \ ’?” \n"
    6: '⁶ And Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    7: '⁷ ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying,
      “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to
      buy it.” ’ '
    8: '⁸ Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according
      to the word of the Lord, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth,
      which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours,
      and the redemption yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the
      word of the Lord. '
    9: '⁹ So I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle who was in Anathoth,
      and weighed out to him the money—seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I signed the deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed the money
      on the scales. '
    11: '¹¹ So I took the purchase deed, both that which was sealed according to the
      law and custom, and that which was open; '
    12: "¹² and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah,\
      \ in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses\
      \ who signed the purchase deed, before all the Jews who sat in the court of\
      \ the prison. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Then I charged Baruch before them, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Take these deeds, both
      this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them
      in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.” '
    15: "¹⁵ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields\
      \ and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.” ’ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah,
      I prayed to the Lord, saying: '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Ah, Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your
      great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You. '
    18: '¹⁸ You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers
      into the bosom of their children after them—the Great, the Mighty God, whose
      name is the Lord of hosts. '
    19: '¹⁹ You are great in counsel and mighty in work, for Your eyes are open to
      all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and
      according to the fruit of his doings. '
    20: '²⁰ You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, to this day, and
      in Israel and among other men; and You have made Yourself a name, as it is this
      day. '
    21: '²¹ You have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs
      and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror; '
    22: '²² You have given them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to
      give them—“a land flowing with milk and honey.” '
    23: "²³ And they came in and took possession of it, but they have not obeyed Your\
      \ voice or walked in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded\
      \ them to do; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ ‘Look, the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it; and the
      city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because
      of the sword and famine and pestilence. What You have spoken has happened; there
      You see it! '
    25: "²⁵ And You have said to me, O Lord God, “Buy the field for money, and take\
      \ witnesses”!—yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard
      for Me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will give this city into the
      hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
      he shall take it. '
    29: '²⁹ And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire
      to this city and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense
      to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger; '
    30: '³⁰ because the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only
      evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have provoked Me
      only to anger with the work of their hands,’ says the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ ‘For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My fury from
      the day that they built it, even to this day; so I will remove it from before
      My face '
    32: '³² because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of
      Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their
      princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ And they have turned to Me the back, and not the face; though I taught
      them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive
      instruction. '
    34: '³⁴ But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name,
      to defile it. '
    35: "³⁵ And they built the high places of Baal which are in the Valley of the\
      \ Son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the\
      \ fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind\
      \ that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.’ \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Now therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this
      city of which you say, ‘It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon
      by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: '
    37: '³⁷ Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them
      in My anger, in My fury, and in great wrath; I will bring them back to this
      place, and I will cause them to dwell safely. '
    38: '³⁸ They shall be My people, and I will be their God; '
    39: '³⁹ then I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever,
      for the good of them and their children after them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
      away from doing them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts so that they
      will not depart from Me. '
    41: "⁴¹ Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will assuredly plant\
      \ them in this land, with all My heart and with all My soul.’ \n"
    42: '⁴² “For thus says the Lord: ‘Just as I have brought all this great calamity
      on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them. '
    43: '⁴³ And fields will be bought in this land of which you say, “It is desolate,
      without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” '
    44: ⁴⁴ Men will buy fields for money, sign deeds and seal them, and take witnesses,
      in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah,
      in the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities
      of the South; for I will cause their captives to return,’ says the Lord.”
  33:
    1: '¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was
      still shut up in the court of the prison, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord who made it, the Lord who formed it to establish it
      (the Lord is His name): '
    3: "³ ‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things,\
      \ which you do not know.’ \n"
    4: '⁴ “For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this
      city and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been pulled down to fortify
      against the siege mounds and the sword: '
    5: '⁵ ‘They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but only to fill their places with
      the dead bodies of men whom I will slay in My anger and My fury, all for whose
      wickedness I have hidden My face from this city. '
    6: '⁶ Behold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal
      to them the abundance of peace and truth. '
    7: '⁷ And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return,
      and will rebuild those places as at the first. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against
      Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned and by
      which they have transgressed against Me. '
    9: "⁹ Then it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all\
      \ nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them; they\
      \ shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and all the prosperity that I\
      \ provide for it.’ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus says the Lord: ‘Again there shall be heard in this place—of which
      you say, “It is desolate, without man and without beast”—in the cities of Judah,
      in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant
      and without beast, '
    11: "¹¹ the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom\
      \ and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who will say:\n“Praise the\
      \ Lord of hosts,\nFor the Lord is good,\nFor His mercy endures forever”—\nand\
      \ of those who will bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord.\
      \ For I will cause the captives of the land to return as at the first,’ says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘In this place which is desolate, without
      man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall again be a dwelling
      place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. '
    13: "¹³ In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities\
      \ of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and\
      \ in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the hands of him\
      \ who counts them,’ says the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ ‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the Lord, ‘that I will perform that\
      \ good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of\
      \ Judah: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ ‘In those days and at that time\nI will cause to grow up to David\nA Branch\
      \ of righteousness;\nHe shall execute judgment and righteousness in the earth.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ In those days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Jerusalem will dwell safely.\n\
      And this is the name by which she will be called:\nTHE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.’\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “For thus says the Lord: ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne
      of the house of Israel; '
    18: "¹⁸ nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man to offer burnt offerings\
      \ before Me, to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.’ ” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “Thus says the Lord: ‘If you can break My covenant with the day and My
      covenant with the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season, '
    21: '²¹ then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant, so that he
      shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests,
      My ministers. '
    22: "²² As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured,\
      \ so will I multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who\
      \ minister to Me.’ ” \n"
    23: '²³ Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    24: "²⁴ “Have you not considered what these people have spoken, saying, ‘The two\
      \ families which the Lord has chosen, He has also cast them off’? Thus they\
      \ have despised My people, as if they should no more be a nation before them.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Thus says the Lord: ‘If My covenant is not with day and night, and if
      I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, '
    26: ²⁶ then I will cast away the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, so
      that I will not take any of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants
      of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captives to return, and
      will have mercy on them.’ ”
  34:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon and all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion,
      and all the people, fought against Jerusalem and all its cities, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of
      Judah and tell him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will give this city into
      the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. '
    3: '³ And you shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be taken and delivered
      into his hand; your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, he shall
      speak with you face to face, and you shall go to Babylon.’ ” ’ '
    4: '⁴ Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the Lord
      concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. '
    5: "⁵ You shall die in peace; as in the ceremonies of your fathers, the former\
      \ kings who were before you, so they shall burn incense for you and lament for\
      \ you, saying, “Alas, lord!” For I have pronounced the word, says the Lord.’\
      \ ” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah
      in Jerusalem, '
    7: "⁷ when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem and all the cities\
      \ of Judah that were left, against Lachish and Azekah; for only these fortified\
      \ cities remained of the cities of Judah. \n"
    8: '⁸ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah
      had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty
      to them: '
    9: '⁹ that every man should set free his male and female slave—a Hebrew man or
      woman—that no one should keep a Jewish brother in bondage. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now when all the princes and all the people, who had entered into the
      covenant, heard that everyone should set free his male and female slaves, that
      no one should keep them in bondage anymore, they obeyed and let them go. '
    11: "¹¹ But afterward they changed their minds and made the male and female slaves\
      \ return, whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as male and\
      \ female slaves. \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers
      in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
      bondage, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ “At the end of seven years let every man set free his Hebrew brother,
      who has been sold to him; and when he has served you six years, you shall let
      him go free from you.” But your fathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then you recently turned and did what was right in My sight—every man
      proclaiming liberty to his neighbor; and you made a covenant before Me in the
      house which is called by My name. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then you turned around and profaned My name, and every one of you brought\
      \ back his male and female slaves, whom you had set at liberty, at their pleasure,\
      \ and brought them back into subjection, to be your male and female slaves.’\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming
      liberty, every one to his brother and every one to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim
      liberty to you,’ says the Lord—‘to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine!
      And I will deliver you to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not
      performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut
      the calf in two and passed between the parts of it— '
    19: '¹⁹ the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests,
      and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— '
    20: '²⁰ I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those
      who seek their life. Their dead bodies shall be for meat for the birds of the
      heaven and the beasts of the earth. '
    21: '²¹ And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hand of
      their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand
      of the king of Babylon’s army which has gone back from you. '
    22: ²² Behold, I will command,’ says the Lord, ‘and cause them to return to this
      city. They will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will
      make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’ ”
  35:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the
      son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, '
    2: "² “Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into the\
      \ house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, his brothers
      and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, '
    4: '⁴ and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons
      of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the
      princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the
      door. '
    5: "⁵ Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of\
      \ wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.” \n"
    6: '⁶ But they said, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our
      father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons, forever. '
    7: '⁷ You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, nor have any of
      these; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days
      in the land where you are sojourners.’ '
    8: '⁸ Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father,
      in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our
      sons, or our daughters, '
    9: '⁹ nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; nor do we have vineyard, field,
      or seed. '
    10: '¹⁰ But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all
      that Jonadab our father commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into\
      \ the land, that we said, ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army\
      \ of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.’ So we dwell at\
      \ Jerusalem.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and tell the men
      of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction
      to obey My words?” says the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons,
      not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, and obey
      their father’s commandment. But although I have spoken to you, rising early
      and speaking, you did not obey Me. '
    15: '¹⁵ I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early
      and sending them, saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way, amend your doings,
      and do not go after other gods to serve them; then you will dwell in the land
      which I have given you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear,
      nor obeyed Me. '
    16: "¹⁶ Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment\
      \ of their father, which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.”\
      \ ’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold,\
      \ I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom\
      \ that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them but they\
      \ have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’ ” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab
      your father, and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded
      you, '
    19: '¹⁹ therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Jonadab the
      son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.” ’ ”'
  36:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king
      of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying: '
    2: '² “Take a scroll of a book and write on it all the words that I have spoken
      to you against Israel, against Judah, and against all the nations, from the
      day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah even to this day. '
    3: "³ It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the adversities which I\
      \ purpose to bring upon them, that everyone may turn from his evil way, that\
      \ I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote on a scroll
      of a book, at the instruction of Jeremiah, all the words of the Lord which He
      had spoken to him. '
    5: '⁵ And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am confined, I cannot go into
      the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ You go, therefore, and read from the scroll which you have written at my
      instruction, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of the people in the Lord’s
      house on the day of fasting. And you shall also read them in the hearing of
      all Judah who come from their cities. '
    7: '⁷ It may be that they will present their supplication before the Lord, and
      everyone will turn from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that
      the Lord has pronounced against this people.” '
    8: "⁸ And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet\
      \ commanded him, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord’s house.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king
      of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to
      all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities
      of Judah to Jerusalem. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the\
      \ Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper\
      \ court at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord’s house, in the hearing of\
      \ all the people. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words
      of the Lord from the book, '
    12: '¹² he then went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and
      there all the princes were sitting—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,
      Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of
      Hananiah, and all the princes. '
    13: '¹³ Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch
      read the book in the hearing of the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of
      Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll
      from which you have read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch
      the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ And they said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch\
      \ read it in their hearing. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, that they looked in
      fear from one to another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king
      of all these words.” '
    17: "¹⁷ And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these\
      \ words—at his instruction?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ So Baruch answered them, “He proclaimed with his mouth all these words\
      \ to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah; and let\
      \ no one know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ And they went to the king, into the court; but they stored the scroll
      in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing
      of the king. '
    21: '²¹ So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll, and he took it from Elishama
      the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the
      hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. '
    22: '²² Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with
      a fire burning on the hearth before him. '
    23: '²³ And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that the
      king cut it with the scribe’s knife and cast it into the fire that was on the
      hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. '
    24: '²⁴ Yet they were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments, the king nor
      any of his servants who heard all these words. '
    25: '²⁵ Nevertheless Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah implored the king not to
      burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel,\
      \ and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the\
      \ prophet, but the Lord hid them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch had
      written at the instruction of Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah,
      saying: '
    28: '²⁸ “Take yet another scroll, and write on it all the former words that were
      in the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. '
    29: '²⁹ And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘Thus says the Lord: “You
      have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it that the king of
      Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and cause man and beast to
      cease from here?’ ” '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He shall
      have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out
      to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. '
    31: "³¹ I will punish him, his family, and his servants for their iniquity; and\
      \ I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah\
      \ all the doom that I have pronounced against them; but they did not heed.”\
      \ ’ ” \n"
    32: ³² Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the
      son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the instruction of Jeremiah all the words
      of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And besides,
      there were added to them many similar words.
  37:
    1: '¹ Now King Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of
      Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. '
    2: "² But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to\
      \ the words of the Lord which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. \n"
    3: '³ And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the
      son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to the
      Lord our God for us.” '
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not yet
      put him in prison. '
    5: "⁵ Then Pharaoh’s army came up from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were\
      \ besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, '
    7: '⁷ “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Thus you shall say to the king
      of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which
      has come up to help you will return to Egypt, to their own land. '
    8: '⁸ And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and take
      it and burn it with fire.” ’ '
    9: '⁹ Thus says the Lord: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will
      surely depart from us,” for they will not depart. '
    10: "¹⁰ For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight\
      \ against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise\
      \ up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire.’ ” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left the siege of Jerusalem
      for fear of Pharaoh’s army, '
    12: '¹² that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to
      claim his property there among the people. '
    13: "¹³ And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there\
      \ whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Jeremiah said, “False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But\
      \ he did not listen to him.\nSo Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the\
      \ princes. "
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him and\
      \ put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that\
      \ the prison. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When Jeremiah entered the dungeon and the cells, and Jeremiah had remained
      there many days, '
    17: "¹⁷ then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. The king asked him secretly\
      \ in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the Lord?”\nAnd Jeremiah said,\
      \ “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king\
      \ of Babylon!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What offense have I committed
      against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put
      me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of
      Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? '
    20: "²⁰ Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition\
      \ be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan\
      \ the scribe, lest I die there.” \n"
    21: ²¹ Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah to the
      court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from
      the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah
      remained in the court of the prison.
  38:
    1: '¹ Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the
      son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah
      had spoken to all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord: ‘He who remains in this city shall die by the sword,
      by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes over to the Chaldeans shall live;
      his life shall be as a prize to him, and he shall live.’ '
    3: "³ Thus says the Lord: ‘This city shall surely be given into the hand of the\
      \ king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.’ ” \n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore the princes said to the king, “Please, let this man be put to\
      \ death, for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this\
      \ city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For\
      \ this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand. For the king can
      do nothing against you.” '
    6: "⁶ So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s\
      \ son, which was in the court of the prison, and they let Jeremiah down with\
      \ ropes. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sank in\
      \ the mire. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs, who was in the king’s
      house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting
      at the Gate of Benjamin, '
    8: '⁸ Ebed-Melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying: '
    9: '⁹ “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to
      Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely
      to die from hunger in the place where he is. For there is no more bread in the
      city.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from
      here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before
      he dies.” '
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king
      under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them
      down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah. '
    12: '¹² Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Please put these old
      clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so. '
    13: "¹³ So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon.\
      \ And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him\
      \ at the third entrance of the house of the Lord. And the king said to Jeremiah,\
      \ “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely\
      \ put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the Lord\
      \ lives, who made our very souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give\
      \ you into the hand of these men who seek your life.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts,
      the God of Israel: ‘If you surely surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes,
      then your soul shall live; this city shall not be burned with fire, and you
      and your house shall live. '
    18: "¹⁸ But if you do not surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this\
      \ city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with\
      \ fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.’ ” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have\
      \ defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they\
      \ abuse me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ But Jeremiah said, “They shall not deliver you. Please, obey the voice
      of the Lord which I speak to you. So it shall be well with you, and your soul
      shall live. '
    21: '²¹ But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the Lord has shown
      me: '
    22: "²² ‘Now behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house shall\
      \ be surrendered to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say:\n\
      “Your close friends have set upon you\nAnd prevailed against you;\nYour feet\
      \ have sunk in the mire,\nAnd they have turned away again.” \n"
    23: "²³ ‘So they shall surrender all your wives and children to the Chaldeans.\
      \ You shall not escape from their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the\
      \ king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.’ ”\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you
      shall not die. '
    25: '²⁵ But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to
      you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also
      what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to
      death,’ '
    26: "²⁶ then you shall say to them, ‘I presented my request before the king, that\
      \ he would not make me return to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them
      according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking
      with him, for the conversation had not been heard. '
    28: ²⁸ Now Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem
      was taken. And he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
  39:
    1: '¹ In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. '
    2: "² In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day\
      \ of the month, the city was penetrated. \n"
    3: "³ Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle\
      \ Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rabmag,\
      \ with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. \n"
    4: '⁴ So it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them,
      that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king’s garden,
      by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the plain. '
    5: '⁵ But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of
      Jericho. And when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment
      on him. '
    6: '⁶ Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in
      Riblah; the king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: '⁷ Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with bronze fetters to
      carry him off to Babylon. '
    8: '⁸ And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with
      fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon
      the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who defected to
      him, with the rest of the people who remained. '
    10: "¹⁰ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the\
      \ poor people, who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same\
      \ time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to
      Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Take him and look after him, and do him no harm; but do to him just as
      he says to you.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer,
      Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s chief officers; '
    14: "¹⁴ then they sent someone to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison,\
      \ and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that\
      \ he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Meanwhile the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was shut
      up in the court of the prison, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for
      adversity and not for good, and they shall be performed in that day before you. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will deliver you in that day,” says the Lord, “and you shall not
      be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. '
    18: ¹⁸ For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but
      your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me,”
      says the Lord.’ ”
  40:
    1: "¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain\
      \ of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains\
      \ among all who were carried away captive from Jerusalem and Judah, who were\
      \ carried away captive to Babylon. \n"
    2: '² And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him: “The Lord your
      God has pronounced this doom on this place. '
    3: '³ Now the Lord has brought it, and has done just as He said. Because you people
      have sinned against the Lord, and not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing
      has come upon you. '
    4: "⁴ And now look, I free you this day from the chains that were on your hand.\
      \ If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look\
      \ after you. But if it seems wrong for you to come with me to Babylon, remain\
      \ here. See, all the land is before you; wherever it seems good and convenient\
      \ for you to go, go there.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Now while Jeremiah had not yet gone back, Nebuzaradan said, “Go back to
      Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has
      made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people.
      Or go wherever it seems convenient for you to go.” So the captain of the guard
      gave him rations and a gift and let him go. '
    6: "⁶ Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt with\
      \ him among the people who were left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ And when all the captains of the armies who were in the fields, they and
      their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
      governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and the
      poorest of the land who had not been carried away captive to Babylon, '
    8: '⁸ then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan
      and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai
      the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. '
    9: '⁹ And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath before
      them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell
      in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for me, I will indeed dwell at Mizpah and serve the Chaldeans who come
      to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, put them in your vessels,
      and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” '
    11: '¹¹ Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in
      Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had
      left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
      the son of Shaphan, '
    12: "¹² then all the Jews returned out of all places where they had been driven,\
      \ and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and\
      \ summer fruit in abundance. \n"
    13: '¹³ Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces
      that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, '
    14: "¹⁴ and said to him, “Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites\
      \ has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to murder you?” But Gedaliah the son\
      \ of Ahikam did not believe them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying,\
      \ “Let me go, please, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one\
      \ will know it. Why should he murder you, so that all the Jews who are gathered\
      \ to you would be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You
      shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
      the son of Elishama, of the royal family and of the officers of the king, came
      with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. And there they ate bread
      together in Mizpah. '
    2: '² Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose
      and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and
      killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is, with Gedaliah\
      \ at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war. \n"
    4: '⁴ And it happened, on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when as
      yet no one knew it, '
    5: '⁵ that certain men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty
      men with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, having cut themselves,
      with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the
      Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping
      as he went along; and it happened as he met them that he said to them, “Come
      to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” '
    7: '⁷ So it was, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son
      of Nethaniah killed them and cast them into the midst of a pit, he and the men
      who were with him. '
    8: '⁸ But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us,
      for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.” So he
      desisted and did not kill them among their brethren. '
    9: '⁹ Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom
      he had slain, because of Gedaliah, was the same one Asa the king had made for
      fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the
      slain. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were\
      \ in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah,\
      \ whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son\
      \ of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and\
      \ departed to go over to the Ammonites. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces
      that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had
      done, '
    12: '¹² they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah;
      and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ So it was, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son
      of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, that they were
      glad. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah
      turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. '
    15: "¹⁵ But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and\
      \ went to the Ammonites. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that
      were with him, took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered
      from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had murdered Gedaliah the son of
      Ahikam—the mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs,
      whom he had brought back from Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is near
      Bethlehem, as they went on their way to Egypt, '
    18: ¹⁸ because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
      the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king
      of Babylon had made governor in the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Now all the captains of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah
      the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, came
      near '
    2: '² and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please, let our petition be acceptable
      to you, and pray for us to the Lord your God, for all this remnant (since we
      are left but a few of many, as you can see), '
    3: "³ that the Lord your God may show us the way in which we should walk and the\
      \ thing we should do.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Indeed, I will pray\
      \ to the Lord your God according to your words, and it shall be, that whatever\
      \ the Lord answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from\
      \ you.” \n"
    5: '⁵ So they said to Jeremiah, “Let the Lord be a true and faithful witness between
      us, if we do not do according to everything which the Lord your God sends us
      by you. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is pleasing or displeasing, we will obey the voice of the Lord\
      \ our God to whom we send you, that it may be well with us when we obey the\
      \ voice of the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ And it happened after ten days that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces
      which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, '
    9: '⁹ and said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent
      me to present your petition before Him: '
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and not
      pull you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up. For I relent concerning
      the disaster that I have brought upon you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not
      be afraid of him,’ says the Lord, ‘for I am with you, to save you and deliver
      you from his hand. '
    12: "¹² And I will show you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and cause you\
      \ to return to your own land.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “But if you say, ‘We will not dwell in this land,’ disobeying the voice
      of the Lord your God, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall see no
      war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there we
      will dwell’— '
    15: '¹⁵ Then hear now the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah! Thus says the
      Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you wholly set your faces to enter Egypt,
      and go to dwell there, '
    16: '¹⁶ then it shall be that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there
      in the land of Egypt; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close
      after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die. '
    17: "¹⁷ So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to\
      \ dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And\
      \ none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon\
      \ them.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘As My anger and\
      \ My fury have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury\
      \ be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you shall be an oath, an astonishment,\
      \ a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.’ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “The Lord has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt!’
      Know certainly that I have admonished you this day. '
    20: '²⁰ For you were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the Lord your
      God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God, and according to all that the
      Lord your God says, so declare to us and we will do it.’ '
    21: '²¹ And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice
      of the Lord your God, or anything which He has sent you by me. '
    22: ²² Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by famine,
      and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to dwell.”
  43:
    1: '¹ Now it happened, when Jeremiah had stopped speaking to all the people all
      the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to
      them, all these words, '
    2: '² that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the
      proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely! The Lord our God has
      not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to dwell there.’ '
    3: '³ But Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into
      the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive
      to Babylon.” '
    4: '⁴ So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the
      people would not obey the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all
      the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all
      nations where they had been driven— '
    6: '⁶ men, women, children, the king’s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan
      the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of
      Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. '
    7: "⁷ So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the\
      \ Lord. And they went as far as Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the sight of the men of
      Judah, in the clay in the brick courtyard which is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s
      house in Tahpanhes; '
    10: '¹⁰ and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold,
      I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will
      set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread his
      royal pavilion over them. '
    11: '¹¹ When he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt and deliver to death
      those appointed for death, and to captivity those appointed for captivity, and
      to the sword those appointed for the sword. '
    12: '¹² I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall
      burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall array himself with the land
      of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, and he shall go out from there
      in peace. '
    13: ¹³ He shall also break the sacred pillars of Beth Shemesh that are in the
      land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians he shall burn with
      fire.” ’ ”
  44:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the
      land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the country
      of Pathros, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You have seen all the
      calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah; and
      behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them, '
    3: '³ because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger,
      in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they did not
      know, they nor you nor your fathers. '
    4: '⁴ However I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and
      sending them, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!” '
    5: '⁵ But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness,
      to burn no incense to other gods. '
    6: "⁶ So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah\
      \ and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is\
      \ this day.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Now therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel:
      ‘Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man
      and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none to remain, '
    8: '⁸ in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense
      to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell, that you may
      cut yourselves off and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the
      earth? '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the
      kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the
      wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the
      streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ They have not been humbled, to this day, nor have they feared; they have\
      \ not walked in My law or in My statutes that I set before you and your fathers.’\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I
      will set My face against you for catastrophe and for cutting off all Judah. '
    12: '¹² And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into
      the land of Egypt to dwell there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in
      the land of Egypt. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine. They shall
      die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine; and they shall
      be an oath, an astonishment, a curse and a reproach! '
    13: '¹³ For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished
      Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, '
    14: "¹⁴ so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt\
      \ to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah,\
      \ to which they desire to return and dwell. For none shall return except those\
      \ who escape.’ ” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other
      gods, with all the women who stood by, a great multitude, and all the people
      who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we
      will not listen to you! '
    17: '¹⁷ But we will certainly do whatever has gone out of our own mouth, to burn
      incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we have
      done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, were well-off,
      and saw no trouble. '
    18: "¹⁸ But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring\
      \ out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed\
      \ by the sword and by famine.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The women also said, “And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven\
      \ and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes for her, to worship\
      \ her, and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands’ permission?”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—the men, the women, and all the
      people who had given him that answer—saying: '
    21: '²¹ “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets
      of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people
      of the land, did not the Lord remember them, and did it not come into His mind? '
    22: '²² So the Lord could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings
      and because of the abominations which you committed. Therefore your land is
      a desolation, an astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as it is
      this day. '
    23: "²³ Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the\
      \ Lord, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord or walked in His law, in His\
      \ statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this calamity has happened to you,\
      \ as at this day.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the
      word of the Lord, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ‘You and your
      wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, saying, “We
      will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the queen of
      heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” You will surely keep your vows
      and perform your vows!’ '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all Judah who dwell in the land of
      Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that My name
      shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt,
      saying, “The Lord God lives.” '
    27: '²⁷ Behold, I will watch over them for adversity and not for good. And all
      the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword
      and by famine, until there is an end to them. '
    28: '²⁸ Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of
      Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone to the
      land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose words will stand, Mine or theirs. '
    29: "²⁹ And this shall be a sign to you,’ says the Lord, ‘that I will punish you\
      \ in this place, that you may know that My words will surely stand against you\
      \ for adversity.’ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt
      into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as
      I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      his enemy who sought his life.’ ”'
  45:
    1: '¹ The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when
      he had written these words in a book at the instruction of Jeremiah, in the
      fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: '
    3: "³ ‘You said, “Woe is me now! For the Lord has added grief to my sorrow. I\
      \ fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.” ’ \n"

    5: ⁵ And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold,

    29: "²⁹ “Call together the archers against Babylon.\nAll you who bend the bow,\
      \ encamp against it all around;\nLet none of them escape.\nRepay her according\
      \ to her work;\nAccording to all she has done, do to her;\nFor she has been\
      \ proud against the Lord,\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets,\nAnd all her men of\
      \ war shall be cut off in that day,” says the Lord.\n"
    31: "³¹ “Behold, I am against you,\nO most haughty one!” says the Lord God of\
      \ hosts;\n“For your day has come,\nThe time that I will punish you.\n"
    32: "³² The most proud shall stumble and fall,\nAnd no one will raise him up;\n\
      I will kindle a fire in his cities,\nAnd it will devour all around him.” \n"
    33: "³³ Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n“The children of Israel were oppressed,\n\
      Along with the children of Judah;\nAll who took them captive have held them\
      \ fast;\nThey have refused to let them go.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Their Redeemer is strong;\nThe Lord of hosts is His name.\nHe will thoroughly\
      \ plead their case,\nThat He may give rest to the land,\nAnd disquiet the inhabitants\
      \ of Babylon. \n"
    35: "³⁵ “A sword is against the Chaldeans,” says the Lord,\n“Against the inhabitants\
      \ of Babylon,\nAnd against her princes and her wise men.\n"
    36: "³⁶ A sword is against the soothsayers, and they will be fools.\nA sword is\
      \ against her mighty men, and they will be dismayed.\n"
    37: "³⁷ A sword is against their horses,\nAgainst their chariots,\nAnd against\
      \ all the mixed peoples who are in her midst;\nAnd they will become like women.\n\
      A sword is against her treasures, and they will be robbed.\n"
    38: "³⁸ A drought is against her waters, and they will be dried up.\nFor it is\
      \ the land of carved images,\nAnd they are insane with their idols. \n"
    39: "³⁹ “Therefore the wild desert beasts shall dwell there with the jackals,\n\
      And the ostriches shall dwell in it.\nIt shall be inhabited no more forever,\n\
      Nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah\nAnd their neighbors,” says the Lord,\n\
      “So no one shall reside there,\nNor son of man dwell in it. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Behold, a people shall come from the north,\nAnd a great nation and many\
      \ kings\nShall be raised up from the ends of the earth.\n"
    42: "⁴² They shall hold the bow and the lance;\nThey are cruel and shall not show\

      \ \n"
    43: "⁴³ “The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,\nAnd his hands grow\

    44: "⁴⁴ “Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the floodplain of the Jordan\n\

      \ away from her.\nAnd who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her?\nFor\
      \ who is like Me?\nWho will arraign Me?\nAnd who is that shepherd\nWho will\
      \ withstand Me?” \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord that He has taken against Babylon,\n\

  51:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,\nAgainst\

    5: "⁵ For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah,\nBy his God, the Lord of hosts,\n\

    6: "⁶ Flee from the midst of Babylon,\nAnd every one save his life!\nDo not be\

    7: "⁷ Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord’s hand,\nThat made all the earth drunk.\n\
      The nations drank her wine;\nTherefore the nations are deranged.\n"
    8: "⁸ Babylon has suddenly fallen and been destroyed.\nWail for her!\nTake balm\

    9: "⁹ We would have healed Babylon,\nBut she is not healed.\nForsake her, and\

    10: "¹⁰ The Lord has revealed our righteousness.\nCome and let us declare in Zion\
      \ the work of the Lord our God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Make the arrows bright!\nGather the shields!\nThe Lord has raised up the\

      \ it,\nBecause it is the vengeance of the Lord,\nThe vengeance for His temple.\n"
    12: "¹² Set up the standard on the walls of Babylon;\nMake the guard strong,\n\
      Set up the watchmen,\nPrepare the ambushes.\nFor the Lord has both devised and\

    29: "²⁹ And the land will tremble and sorrow;\nFor every purpose of the Lord shall\
      \ be performed against Babylon,\nTo make the land of Babylon a desolation without\
      \ inhabitant.\n"
    30: "³⁰ The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting,\nThey have remained in\
      \ their strongholds;\nTheir might has failed,\nThey became like women;\nThey\
      \ have burned her dwelling places,\nThe bars of her gate are broken.\n"
    31: "³¹ One runner will run to meet another,\nAnd one messenger to meet another,\n\
      To show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on all sides;\n"
    32: "³² The passages are blocked,\nThe reeds they have burned with fire,\nAnd\
      \ the men of war are terrified. \n"
    33: "³³ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:\n“The daughter of\

    34: "³⁴ “Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon\nHas devoured me, he has crushed me;\n\
      He has made me an empty vessel,\nHe has swallowed me up like a monster;\nHe\
      \ has filled his stomach with my delicacies,\nHe has spit me out.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon,”\nThe inhabitant\
      \ of Zion will say;\n“And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!”\nJerusalem\
      \ will say. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord:\n“Behold, I will plead your case and take\

      \ Lord.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ “I will bring them down\nLike lambs to the slaughter,\nLike rams with\

    42: "⁴² The sea has come up over Babylon;\nShe is covered with the multitude of\

    45: "⁴⁵ “My people, go out of the midst of her!\nAnd let everyone deliver himself\
      \ from the fierce anger of the Lord.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ And lest your heart faint,\nAnd you fear for the rumor that will be heard\
      \ in the land\n(A rumor will come one year,\nAnd after that, in another year\n\
      A rumor will come,\nAnd violence in the land,\nRuler against ruler),\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Therefore behold, the days are coming\nThat I will bring judgment on the\
      \ carved images of Babylon;\nHer whole land shall be ashamed,\nAnd all her slain\
      \ shall fall in her midst.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then the heavens and the earth and all that is in them\nShall sing joyously\
      \ over Babylon;\nFor the plunderers shall come to her from the north,” says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,\nSo at Babylon the\
      \ slain of all the earth shall fall.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ You who have escaped the sword,\nGet away! Do not stand still!\nRemember\

    53: "⁵³ Though Babylon were to mount up to heaven,\nAnd though she were to fortify\
      \ the height of her strength,\nYet from Me plunderers would come to her,” says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ The sound of a cry comes from Babylon,\nAnd great destruction from the\
      \ land of the Chaldeans,\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ Because the Lord is plundering Babylon\nAnd silencing her loud voice,\n\
      Though her waves roar like great waters,\nAnd the noise of their voice is uttered,\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Because the plunderer comes against her, against Babylon,\nAnd her mighty\
      \ men are taken.\nEvery one of their bows is broken;\nFor the Lord is the God\
      \ of recompense,\nHe will surely repay. \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ “And I will make drunk\nHer princes and wise men,\nHer governors, her\
      \ deputies, and her mighty men.\nAnd they shall sleep a perpetual sleep\nAnd\
      \ not awake,” says the King,\nWhose name is the Lord of hosts. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n“The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly\
      \ broken,\nAnd her high gates shall be burned with fire;\nThe people will labor\
      \ in vain,\nAnd the nations, because of the fire;\nAnd they shall be weary.”\
      \ \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah,
      the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon
      in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was the quartermaster. '
    60: '⁶⁰ So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon,
      all these words that are written against Babylon. '
    61: '⁶¹ And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon and see it,
      and read all these words, '
    62: '⁶² then you shall say, ‘O Lord, You have spoken against this place to cut
      it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but it shall
      be desolate forever.’ '
    63: '⁶³ Now it shall be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall
      tie a stone to it and throw it out into the Euphrates. '
    64: "⁶⁴ Then you shall say, ‘Thus Babylon shall sink and not rise from the catastrophe\
      \ that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary.’ ”\nThus far are the\
      \ words of Jeremiah."
  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of
      Libnah. '
    2: '² He also did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim
      had done. '
    3: "³ For because of the anger of the Lord this happened in Jerusalem and Judah,\
      \ till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against\
      \ the king of Babylon. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
      on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his
      army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege
      wall against it all around. '
    5: '⁵ So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. '
    6: '⁶ By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become
      so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. '
    7: "⁷ Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went\
      \ out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was\
      \ by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were near the city all around.\
      \ And they went by way of the plain. \n"
    8: '⁸ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah
      in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. '
    9: '⁹ So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah
      in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes.
      And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. '
    11: "¹¹ He also put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him\
      \ in bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day\
      \ of his death. \n"
    12: '¹² Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month (which was the nineteenth
      year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the
      guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ He burned the house of the Lord and the king’s house; all the houses of
      Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard
      broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of
      the poor people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors
      who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the\
      \ land as vinedressers and farmers. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the carts and
      the bronze Sea that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces,
      and carried all their bronze to Babylon. '
    18: '¹⁸ They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the bowls, the
      spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered. '
    19: '¹⁹ The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons,
      and the cups, whatever was solid gold and whatever was solid silver, the captain
      of the guard took away. '
    20: '²⁰ The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under it,
      and the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord—the bronze
      of all these articles was beyond measure. '
    21: '²¹ Now concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits,
      a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness
      was four fingers; it was hollow. '
    22: '²² A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of one capital was five
      cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around the capital, all of bronze.
      The second pillar, with pomegranates was the same. '
    23: "²³ There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates,\
      \ all around on the network, were one hundred. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the
      second priest, and the three doorkeepers. '
    25: '²⁵ He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war,
      seven men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the principal
      scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the
      people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. '
    26: '²⁶ And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to
      the king of Babylon at Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in\
      \ the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the
      seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews; '
    29: '²⁹ in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from
      Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; '
    30: "³⁰ in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of\
      \ the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons.\
      \ All the persons were four thousand six hundred. \n"
    31: '³¹ Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin
      king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that
      Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the
      head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. '
    32: '³² And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those
      of the kings who were with him in Babylon. '
    33: '³³ So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly
      before the king all the days of his life. '
    34: ³⁴ And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the
      king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the
      days of his life.
