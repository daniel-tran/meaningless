2 Corinthians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,\n\
      To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all\
      \ Achaia: \n"
    2: "² Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: '³ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies
      and God of all comfort, '
    4: '⁴ who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those
      who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
      by God. '
    5: '⁵ For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds
      through Christ. '
    6: '⁶ Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which
      is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we
      are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. '
    7: "⁷ And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers\
      \ of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation. \n"
    8: '⁸ For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came
      to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that
      we despaired even of life. '
    9: '⁹ Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust
      in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, '
    10: '¹⁰ who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we
      trust that He will still deliver us, '
    11: "¹¹ you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by\
      \ many persons on our behalf for the gift granted to us through many. \n"
    12: '¹² For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted
      ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom
      but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. '
    13: '¹³ For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand.
      Now I trust you will understand, even to the end '
    14: "¹⁴ (as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you\
      \ also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might
      have a second benefit— '
    16: '¹⁶ to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you,
      and be helped by you on my way to Judea. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things
      I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes,
      Yes, and No, No? '
    18: '¹⁸ But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No. '
    19: '¹⁹ For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by
      me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. '
    20: '²⁰ For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory
      of God through us. '
    21: '²¹ Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God, '
    22: "²² who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came
      no more to Corinth. '
    24: ²⁴ Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your
      joy; for by faith you stand.
  2:
    1: '¹ But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you
      in sorrow. '
    2: "² For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one\
      \ who is made sorrowful by me? \n"
    3: '³ And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow
      over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that
      my joy is the joy of you all. '
    4: "⁴ For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many\
      \ tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which\
      \ I have so abundantly for you. \n"
    5: '⁵ But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to
      some extent—not to be too severe. '
    6: '⁶ This punishment which was inflicted by the majority is sufficient for such
      a man, '
    7: '⁷ so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest
      perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. '
    8: '⁸ Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him. '
    9: '⁹ For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether
      you are obedient in all things. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven
      anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, '
    11: "¹¹ lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his\
      \ devices. \n"
    12: '¹² Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door
      was opened to me by the Lord, '
    13: "¹³ I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but\
      \ taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through
      us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. '
    15: '¹⁵ For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved
      and among those who are perishing. '
    16: '¹⁶ To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other
      the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things? '
    17: ¹⁷ For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity,
      but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.
  3:
    1: '¹ Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some others, epistles
      of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you? '
    2: '² You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men; '
    3: "³ clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with\
      \ ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets\
      \ of flesh, that is, of the heart. \n"
    4: '⁴ And we have such trust through Christ toward God. '
    5: '⁵ Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from
      ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, '
    6: "⁶ who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the\
      \ letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious,
      so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses
      because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, '
    8: '⁸ how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? '
    9: '⁹ For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness
      exceeds much more in glory. '
    10: '¹⁰ For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because
      of the glory that excels. '
    11: "¹¹ For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech— '
    13: '¹³ unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel
      could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away. '
    14: '¹⁴ But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains
      unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away
      in Christ. '
    15: '¹⁵ But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. '
    16: '¹⁶ Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
      is liberty. '
    18: ¹⁸ But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the
      Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as
      by the Spirit of the Lord.
  4:
    1: '¹ Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do
      not lose heart. '
    2: '² But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness
      nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth
      commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. '
    3: '³ But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, '
    4: '⁴ whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the
      light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should
      shine on them. '
    5: '⁵ For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves
      your bondservants for Jesus’ sake. '
    6: "⁶ For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has\
      \ shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God\
      \ in the face of Jesus Christ. \n"
    7: '⁷ But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the
      power may be of God and not of us. '
    8: '⁸ We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but
      not in despair; '
    9: '⁹ persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— '
    10: '¹⁰ always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the
      life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. '
    11: '¹¹ For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the
      life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. '
    12: "¹² So then death is working in us, but life in you. \n"
    13: '¹³ And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written,
      “I believed and therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak, '
    14: '¹⁴ knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with
      Jesus, and will present us with you. '
    15: "¹⁵ For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the\
      \ many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing,
      yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. '
    17: '¹⁷ For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us
      a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, '
    18: ¹⁸ while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which
      are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which
      are not seen are eternal.
  5:
    1: '¹ For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have
      a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. '
    2: '² For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation
      which is from heaven, '
    3: '³ if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. '
    4: '⁴ For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to
      be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. '
    5: "⁵ Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given\
      \ us the Spirit as a guarantee. \n"
    6: '⁶ So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body
      we are absent from the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ For we walk by faith, not by sight. '
    8: "⁸ We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and\
      \ to be present with the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing
      to Him. '
    10: '¹⁰ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one
      may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether
      good or bad. '
    11: "¹¹ Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are\
      \ well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences. \n"
    12: '¹² For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity
      to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance
      and not in heart. '
    13: '¹³ For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind,
      it is for you. '
    14: '¹⁴ For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One
      died for all, then all died; '
    15: "¹⁵ and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves,\
      \ but for Him who died for them and rose again. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even
      though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus
      no longer. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have
      passed away; behold, all things have become new. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus
      Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, '
    19: "¹⁹ that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not\
      \ imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through
      us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God. '
    21: ²¹ For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become
      the righteousness of God in Him.
  6:
    1: '¹ We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive
      the grace of God in vain. '
    2: "² For He says:\n“In an acceptable time I have heard you,\nAnd in the day of\
      \ salvation I have helped you.”\nBehold, now is the accepted time; behold, now\
      \ is the day of salvation. \n"
    3: '³ We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. '
    4: '⁴ But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience,
      in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, '
    5: '⁵ in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in
      fastings; '
    6: '⁶ by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit,
      by sincere love, '
    7: '⁷ by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness
      on the right hand and on the left, '
    8: '⁸ by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and
      yet true; '
    9: '⁹ as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened,
      and yet not killed; '
    10: "¹⁰ as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as\
      \ having nothing, and yet possessing all things. \n"
    11: '¹¹ O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open. '
    12: '¹² You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections. '
    13: "¹³ Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship
      has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? '
    15: '¹⁵ And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with
      an unbeliever? '
    16: "¹⁶ And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple\
      \ of the living God. As God has said:\n“I will dwell in them\nAnd walk among\
      \ them.\nI will be their God,\nAnd they shall be My people.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore\n“Come out from among them\nAnd be separate, says the Lord.\n\
      Do not touch what is unclean,\nAnd I will receive you.”\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I will be a Father to you,\nAnd you shall be My sons and daughters,\n\
      Says the Lord Almighty.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from\
      \ all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of\
      \ God. \n"
    2: '² Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one,
      we have cheated no one. '
    3: '³ I do not say this to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our
      hearts, to die together and to live together. '
    4: "⁴ Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my boasting on your\
      \ behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were
      troubled on every side. Outside were conflicts, inside were fears. '
    6: '⁶ Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming
      of Titus, '
    7: "⁷ and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was\
      \ comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your\
      \ zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more. \n"
    8: '⁸ For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though
      I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though
      only for a while. '
    9: '⁹ Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to
      repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer
      loss from us in nothing. '
    10: '¹⁰ For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted;
      but the sorrow of the world produces death. '
    11: '¹¹ For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What
      diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation,
      what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things
      you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter. '
    12: "¹² Therefore, although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the sake of him\
      \ who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that\
      \ our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you. \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly
      more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. '
    14: '¹⁴ For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed.
      But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was
      found true. '
    15: '¹⁵ And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of
      you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. '
    16: ¹⁶ Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.
  8:
    1: '¹ Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the
      churches of Macedonia: '
    2: '² that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their
      deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. '
    3: '³ For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their
      ability, they were freely willing, '
    4: '⁴ imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship
      of the ministering to the saints. '
    5: '⁵ And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord,
      and then to us by the will of God. '
    6: '⁶ So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this
      grace in you as well. '
    7: "⁷ But as you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all\
      \ diligence, and in your love for us—see that you abound in this grace also.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love
      by the diligence of others. '
    9: "⁹ For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich,\
      \ yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become\
      \ rich. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing
      what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; '
    11: '¹¹ but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was a readiness
      to desire it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have. '
    12: "¹² For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what\
      \ one has, and not according to what he does not have. \n"
    13: '¹³ For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened; '
    14: '¹⁴ but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their
      lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack—that there may be equality. '
    15: "¹⁵ As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he\
      \ who gathered little had no lack.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart
      of Titus. '
    17: '¹⁷ For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he
      went to you of his own accord. '
    18: '¹⁸ And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout
      all the churches, '
    19: '¹⁹ and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with
      us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself
      and to show your ready mind, '
    20: '²⁰ avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is
      administered by us— '
    21: "²¹ providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also\
      \ in the sight of men. \n"
    22: '²² And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent
      in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence
      which we have in you. '
    23: '²³ If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker concerning
      you. Or if our brethren are inquired about, they are messengers of the churches,
      the glory of Christ. '
    24: ²⁴ Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love
      and of our boasting on your behalf.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to
      write to you; '
    2: '² for I know your willingness, about which I boast of you to the Macedonians,
      that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority. '
    3: '³ Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain
      in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready; '
    4: '⁴ lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to
      mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting. '
    5: "⁵ Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead\
      \ of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which you had previously\
      \ promised, that it may be ready as a matter of generosity and not as a grudging\
      \ obligation. \n"
    6: '⁶ But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who
      sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. '
    7: '⁷ So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;
      for God loves a cheerful giver. '
    8: '⁸ And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having
      all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. '
    9: "⁹ As it is written:\n“He has dispersed abroad,\nHe has given to the poor;\n\
      His righteousness endures forever.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply
      and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, '
    11: '¹¹ while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes
      thanksgiving through us to God. '
    12: '¹² For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of
      the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God, '
    13: '¹³ while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience
      of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with
      them and all men, '
    14: '¹⁴ and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding
      grace of God in you. '
    15: ¹⁵ Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
  10:
    1: '¹ Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness
      of Christ—who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward
      you. '
    2: '² But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence
      by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according
      to the flesh. '
    3: '³ For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. '
    4: '⁴ For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling
      down strongholds, '
    5: '⁵ casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the
      knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of
      Christ, '
    6: "⁶ and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is
      convinced in himself that he is Christ’s, let him again consider this in himself,
      that just as he is Christ’s, even so we are Christ’s. '
    8: '⁸ For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the
      Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed— '
    9: '⁹ lest I seem to terrify you by letters. '
    10: '¹⁰ “For his letters,” they say, “are weighty and powerful, but his bodily
      presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.” '
    11: "¹¹ Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when\
      \ we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present. \n"
    12: '¹² For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend
      themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
      among themselves, are not wise. '
    13: '¹³ We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the
      sphere which God appointed us—a sphere which especially includes you. '
    14: '¹⁴ For we are not overextending ourselves (as though our authority did not
      extend to you), for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ; '
    15: '¹⁵ not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other men’s labors,
      but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged
      by you in our sphere, '
    16: "¹⁶ to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another\
      \ man’s sphere of accomplishment. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ But “he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.” '
    18: ¹⁸ For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
  11:
    1: '¹ Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly—and indeed you do bear
      with me. '
    2: '² For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to
      one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. '
    3: '³ But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness,
      so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. '
    4: "⁴ For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or\
      \ if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different\
      \ gospel which you have not accepted—you may well put up with it! \n"
    5: '⁵ For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles. '
    6: "⁶ Even though I am untrained in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. But we\
      \ have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things. \n"
    7: '⁷ Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I
      preached the gospel of God to you free of charge? '
    8: '⁸ I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you. '
    9: '⁹ And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one,
      for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything
      I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself. '
    10: '¹⁰ As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this boasting
      in the regions of Achaia. '
    11: "¹¹ Why? Because I do not love you? God knows! \n"
    12: '¹² But what I do, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity
      from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things
      of which they boast. '
    13: '¹³ For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves
      into apostles of Christ. '
    14: '¹⁴ And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. '
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves\
      \ into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive
      me as a fool, that I also may boast a little. '
    17: '¹⁷ What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly,
      in this confidence of boasting. '
    18: '¹⁸ Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast. '
    19: '¹⁹ For you put up with fools gladly, since you yourselves are wise! '
    20: '²⁰ For you put up with it if one brings you into bondage, if one devours
      you, if one takes from you, if one exalts himself, if one strikes you on the
      face. '
    21: "²¹ To our shame I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone\
      \ is bold—I speak foolishly—I am bold also. \n"
    22: '²² Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the
      seed of Abraham? So am I. '
    23: '²³ Are they ministers of Christ?—I speak as a fool—I am more: in labors more
      abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. '
    24: '²⁴ From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. '
    25: '²⁵ Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was
      shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; '
    26: '²⁶ in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils
      of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils
      in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; '
    27: '²⁷ in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in
      fastings often, in cold and nakedness— '
    28: '²⁸ besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for
      all the churches. '
    29: "²⁹ Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn\
      \ with indignation? \n"
    30: '³⁰ If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity. '
    31: '³¹ The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows
      that I am not lying. '
    32: '³² In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city
      of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me; '
    33: ³³ but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped
      from his hands.
  12:
    1: '¹ It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and
      revelations of the Lord: '
    2: '² I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not
      know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a one was caught
      up to the third heaven. '
    3: '³ And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know,
      God knows— '
    4: '⁴ how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which
      it is not lawful for a man to utter. '
    5: '⁵ Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my
      infirmities. '
    6: "⁶ For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak\
      \ the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees\
      \ me to be or hears from me. \n"
    7: '⁷ And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations,
      a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest
      I be exalted above measure. '
    8: '⁸ Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might
      depart from me. '
    9: '⁹ And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made
      perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities,
      that the power of Christ may rest upon me. '
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in\
      \ persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I\
      \ am strong. \n"
    11: '¹¹ I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to
      have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles,
      though I am nothing. '
    12: '¹² Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance,
      in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. '
    13: "¹³ For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that\
      \ I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong! \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome
      to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay
      up for the parents, but the parents for the children. '
    15: "¹⁵ And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more\
      \ abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty,
      I caught you by cunning! '
    17: '¹⁷ Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? '
    18: "¹⁸ I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage\
      \ of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God
      in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification. '
    20: '²⁰ For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and
      that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions,
      jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings,
      conceits, tumults; '
    21: ²¹ lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn
      for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication,
      and lewdness which they have practiced.
  13:
    1: '¹ This will be the third time I am coming to you. “By the mouth of two or
      three witnesses every word shall be established.” '
    2: '² I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time,
      and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the
      rest, that if I come again I will not spare— '
    3: '³ since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward
      you, but mighty in you. '
    4: "⁴ For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God.\
      \ For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God\
      \ toward you. \n"
    5: '⁵ Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves.
      Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are
      disqualified. '
    6: "⁶ But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved,
      but that you should do what is honorable, though we may seem disqualified. '
    8: '⁸ For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. '
    9: '⁹ For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray,
      that you may be made complete. '
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should\
      \ use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for\
      \ edification and not for destruction. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of\
      \ one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. \n"
    12: "¹² Greet one another with a holy kiss. \n"
    13: "¹³ All the saints greet you. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion
      of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
