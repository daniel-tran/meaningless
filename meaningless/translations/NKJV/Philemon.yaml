Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon\
      \ our beloved friend and fellow laborer, "
    2: "² to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in\
      \ your house: \n"
    3: "³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, '
    5: '⁵ hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and
      toward all the saints, '
    6: '⁶ that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment
      of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. '
    7: "⁷ For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of\
      \ the saints have been refreshed by you, brother. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is
      fitting, '
    9: '⁹ yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, the
      aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ— '
    10: '¹⁰ I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my
      chains, '
    11: "¹¹ who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to\
      \ me. \n"
    12: '¹² I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, '
    13: '¹³ whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to
      me in my chains for the gospel. '
    14: "¹⁴ But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might\
      \ not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive
      him forever, '
    16: "¹⁶ no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially\
      \ to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. '
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay—not to mention to you
      that you owe me even your own self besides. '
    20: "²⁰ Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    21: '²¹ Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you
      will do even more than I say. '
    22: "²² But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through\
      \ your prayers I shall be granted to you. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, '
    24: "²⁴ as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
