Obadiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom\n(We have\
      \ heard a report from the Lord,\nAnd a messenger has been sent among the nations,\
      \ saying,\n“Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle”): \n"
    2: "² “Behold, I will make you small among the nations;\nYou shall be greatly\
      \ despised.\n"
    3: "³ The pride of your heart has deceived you,\nYou who dwell in the clefts of\
      \ the rock,\nWhose habitation is high;\nYou who say in your heart, ‘Who will\
      \ bring me down to the ground?’\n"
    4: "⁴ Though you ascend as high as the eagle,\nAnd though you set your nest among\
      \ the stars,\nFrom there I will bring you down,” says the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “If thieves had come to you,\nIf robbers by night—\nOh, how you will be\
      \ cut off!—\nWould they not have stolen till they had enough?\nIf grape-gatherers\
      \ had come to you,\nWould they not have left some gleanings? \n"
    6: "⁶ “Oh, how Esau shall be searched out!\nHow his hidden treasures shall be\
      \ sought after!\n"
    7: "⁷ All the men in your confederacy\nShall force you to the border;\nThe men\
      \ at peace with you\nShall deceive you and prevail against you.\nThose who eat\
      \ your bread shall lay a trap for you.\nNo one is aware of it. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Will I not in that day,” says the Lord,\n“Even destroy the wise men from\
      \ Edom,\nAnd understanding from the mountains of Esau?\n"
    9: "⁹ Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,\nTo the end that everyone\
      \ from the mountains of Esau\nMay be cut off by slaughter. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “For violence against your brother Jacob,\nShame shall cover you,\nAnd\
      \ you shall be cut off forever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ In the day that you stood on the other side—\nIn the day that strangers\
      \ carried captive his forces,\nWhen foreigners entered his gates\nAnd cast lots\
      \ for Jerusalem—\nEven you were as one of them. \n"
    12: "¹² “But you should not have gazed on the day of your brother\nIn the day\
      \ of his captivity;\nNor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah\n\
      In the day of their destruction;\nNor should you have spoken proudly\nIn the\
      \ day of distress.\n"
    13: "¹³ You should not have entered the gate of My people\nIn the day of their\
      \ calamity.\nIndeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction\nIn the day\
      \ of their calamity,\nNor laid hands on their substance\nIn the day of their\
      \ calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You should not have stood at the crossroads\nTo cut off those among them\
      \ who escaped;\nNor should you have delivered up those among them who remained\n\
      In the day of distress. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “For the day of the Lord upon all the nations is near;\nAs you have done,\
      \ it shall be done to you;\nYour reprisal shall return upon your own head.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For as you drank on My holy mountain,\nSo shall all the nations drink\
      \ continually;\nYes, they shall drink, and swallow,\nAnd they shall be as though\
      \ they had never been. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance,\nAnd there shall be holiness;\n\
      The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The house of Jacob shall be a fire,\nAnd the house of Joseph a flame;\n\
      But the house of Esau shall be stubble;\nThey shall kindle them and devour them,\n\
      And no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau,”\nFor the Lord has spoken.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The South shall possess the mountains of Esau,\nAnd the Lowland shall\
      \ possess Philistia.\nThey shall possess the fields of Ephraim\nAnd the fields\
      \ of Samaria.\nBenjamin shall possess Gilead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ And the captives of this host of the children of Israel\nShall possess\
      \ the land of the Canaanites\nAs far as Zarephath.\nThe captives of Jerusalem\
      \ who are in Sepharad\nShall possess the cities of the South.\n"
    21: "²¹ Then saviors shall come to Mount Zion\nTo judge the mountains of Esau,\n\
      And the kingdom shall be the Lord’s."
