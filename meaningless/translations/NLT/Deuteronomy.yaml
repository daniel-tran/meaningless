Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: "¹ These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they\
      \ were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were camped in the Jordan\
      \ Valley near Suph, between Paran on one side and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and\
      \ Di-zahab on the other. \n"
    2: '² Normally it takes only eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-barnea,
      going by way of Mount Seir. '
    3: '³ But forty years after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first day of the
      eleventh month, Moses addressed the people of Israel, telling them everything
      the Lord had commanded him to say. '
    4: "⁴ This took place after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled\
      \ in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated King Og of Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ While the Israelites were in the land of Moab east of the Jordan River,\
      \ Moses carefully explained the Lord’s instructions as follows. \n"
    6: '⁶ “When we were at Mount Sinai, the Lord our God said to us, ‘You have stayed
      at this mountain long enough. '
    7: '⁷ It is time to break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites
      and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the
      western foothills, the Negev, and the coastal plain. Go to the land of the Canaanites
      and to Lebanon, and all the way to the great Euphrates River. '
    8: "⁸ Look, I am giving all this land to you! Go in and occupy it, for it is the\
      \ land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and\
      \ to all their descendants.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ Moses continued, “At that time I told you, ‘You are too great a burden for
      me to carry all by myself. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord your God has increased your population, making you as numerous
      as the stars! '
    11: '¹¹ And may the Lord, the God of your ancestors, multiply you a thousand times
      more and bless you as he promised! '
    12: '¹² But you are such a heavy load to carry! How can I deal with all your problems
      and bickering? '
    13: "¹³ Choose some well-respected men from each tribe who are known for their\
      \ wisdom and understanding, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Then you responded, ‘Your plan is a good one.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes\
      \ and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you. Some were responsible\
      \ for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “At that time I instructed the judges, ‘You must hear the cases of your
      fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you. Be perfectly fair in
      your decisions '
    17: "¹⁷ and impartial in your judgments. Hear the cases of those who are poor\
      \ as well as those who are rich. Don’t be afraid of anyone’s anger, for the\
      \ decision you make is God’s decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult\
      \ for you, and I will handle them.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Then, just as the Lord our God commanded us, we left Mount Sinai and
      traveled through the great and terrifying wilderness, as you yourselves remember,
      and headed toward the hill country of the Amorites. When we arrived at Kadesh-barnea, '
    20: '²⁰ I said to you, ‘You have now reached the hill country of the Amorites
      that the Lord our God is giving us. '
    21: "²¹ Look! He has placed the land in front of you. Go and occupy it as the\
      \ Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you. Don’t be afraid! Don’t\
      \ be discouraged!’ \n"
    22: "²² “But you all came to me and said, ‘First, let’s send out scouts to explore\
      \ the land for us. They will advise us on the best route to take and which towns\
      \ we should enter.’ \n"
    23: '²³ “This seemed like a good idea to me, so I chose twelve scouts, one from
      each of your tribes. '
    24: '²⁴ They headed for the hill country and came to the valley of Eshcol and
      explored it. '
    25: "²⁵ They picked some of its fruit and brought it back to us. And they reported,\
      \ ‘The land the Lord our God has given us is indeed a good land.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God and refused
      to go in. '
    27: '²⁷ You complained in your tents and said, ‘The Lord must hate us. That’s
      why he has brought us here from Egypt—to hand us over to the Amorites to be
      slaughtered. '
    28: "²⁸ Where can we go? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report. They\
      \ tell us, “The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are,\
      \ and their towns are large, with walls rising high into the sky! We even saw\
      \ giants there—the descendants of Anak!”’ \n"
    29: '²⁹ “But I said to you, ‘Don’t be shocked or afraid of them! '
    30: '³⁰ The Lord your God is going ahead of you. He will fight for you, just as
      you saw him do in Egypt. '
    31: "³¹ And you saw how the Lord your God cared for you all along the way as you\
      \ traveled through the wilderness, just as a father cares for his child. Now\
      \ he has brought you to this place.’ \n"
    32: '³² “But even after all he did, you refused to trust the Lord your God, '
    33: "³³ who goes before you looking for the best places to camp, guiding you with\
      \ a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “When the Lord heard your complaining, he became very angry. So he solemnly
      swore, '
    35: '³⁵ ‘Not one of you from this wicked generation will live to see the good
      land I swore to give your ancestors, '
    36: "³⁶ except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see this land because he has followed\
      \ the Lord completely. I will give to him and his descendants some of the very\
      \ land he explored during his scouting mission.’ \n"
    37: '³⁷ “And the Lord was also angry with me because of you. He said to me, ‘Moses,
      not even you will enter the Promised Land! '
    38: '³⁸ Instead, your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will lead the people into
      the land. Encourage him, for he will lead Israel as they take possession of
      it. '
    39: '³⁹ I will give the land to your little ones—your innocent children. You were
      afraid they would be captured, but they will be the ones who occupy it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ As for you, turn around now and go on back through the wilderness toward\
      \ the Red Sea.’ \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Then you confessed, ‘We have sinned against the Lord! We will go into\
      \ the land and fight for it, as the Lord our God has commanded us.’ So your\
      \ men strapped on their weapons, thinking it would be easy to attack the hill\
      \ country. \n"
    42: "⁴² “But the Lord told me to tell you, ‘Do not attack, for I am not with you.\
      \ If you go ahead on your own, you will be crushed by your enemies.’ \n"
    43: '⁴³ “This is what I told you, but you would not listen. Instead, you again
      rebelled against the Lord’s command and arrogantly went into the hill country
      to fight. '
    44: '⁴⁴ But the Amorites who lived there came out against you like a swarm of
      bees. They chased and battered you all the way from Seir to Hormah. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Then you returned and wept before the Lord, but he refused to listen. '
    46: ⁴⁶ So you stayed there at Kadesh for a long time.
  2:
    1: "¹ “Then we turned around and headed back across the wilderness toward the\
      \ Red Sea, just as the Lord had instructed me, and we wandered around in the\
      \ region of Mount Seir for a long time. \n"
    2: '² “Then at last the Lord said to me, '
    3: '³ ‘You have been wandering around in this hill country long enough; turn to
      the north. '
    4: '⁴ Give these orders to the people: “You will pass through the country belonging
      to your relatives the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. The
      Edomites will feel threatened, so be careful. '
    5: '⁵ Do not bother them, for I have given them all the hill country around Mount
      Seir as their property, and I will not give you even one square foot of their
      land. '
    6: '⁶ If you need food to eat or water to drink, pay them for it. '
    7: "⁷ For the Lord your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He has\
      \ watched your every step through this great wilderness. During these forty\
      \ years, the Lord your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.”’\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “So we bypassed the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau,\
      \ who live in Seir. We avoided the road through the Arabah Valley that comes\
      \ up from Elath and Ezion-geber.\n“Then as we turned north along the desert\
      \ route through Moab, "
    9: "⁹ the Lord warned us, ‘Do not bother the Moabites, the descendants of Lot,\
      \ or start a war with them. I have given them Ar as their property, and I will\
      \ not give you any of their land.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ (A race of giants called the Emites had once lived in the area of Ar.
      They were as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites, another race of giants. '
    11: '¹¹ Both the Emites and the Anakites are also known as the Rephaites, though
      the Moabites call them Emites. '
    12: "¹² In earlier times the Horites had lived in Seir, but they were driven out\
      \ and displaced by the descendants of Esau, just as Israel drove out the people\
      \ of Canaan when the Lord gave Israel their land.) \n"
    13: "¹³ Moses continued, “Then the Lord said to us, ‘Get moving. Cross the Zered\
      \ Brook.’ So we crossed the brook. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Thirty-eight years passed from the time we first left Kadesh-barnea until
      we finally crossed the Zered Brook! By then, all the men old enough to fight
      in battle had died in the wilderness, as the Lord had vowed would happen. '
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord struck them down until they had all been eliminated from the\
      \ community. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “When all the men of fighting age had died, '
    17: '¹⁷ the Lord said to me, '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘Today you will cross the border of Moab at Ar '
    19: "¹⁹ and enter the land of the Ammonites, the descendants of Lot. But do not\
      \ bother them or start a war with them. I have given the land of Ammon to them\
      \ as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.’” \n"
    20: '²⁰ (That area was once considered the land of the Rephaites, who had lived
      there, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummites. '
    21: '²¹ They were also as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the
      Lord destroyed them so the Ammonites could occupy their land. '
    22: '²² He had done the same for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, for
      he destroyed the Horites so they could settle there in their place. The descendants
      of Esau live there to this day. '
    23: "²³ A similar thing happened when the Caphtorites from Crete invaded and destroyed\
      \ the Avvites, who had lived in villages in the area of Gaza.) \n"
    24: '²⁴ Moses continued, “Then the Lord said, ‘Now get moving! Cross the Arnon
      Gorge. Look, I will hand over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and
      I will give you his land. Attack him and begin to occupy the land. '
    25: "²⁵ Beginning today I will make people throughout the earth terrified because\
      \ of you. When they hear reports about you, they will tremble with dread and\
      \ fear.’” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Moses continued, “From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent ambassadors to\
      \ King Sihon of Heshbon with this proposal of peace: \n"
    27: '²⁷ ‘Let us travel through your land. We will stay on the main road and won’t
      turn off into the fields on either side. '
    28: '²⁸ Sell us food to eat and water to drink, and we will pay for it. All we
      want is permission to pass through your land. '
    29: "²⁹ The descendants of Esau who live in Seir allowed us to go through their\
      \ country, and so did the Moabites, who live in Ar. Let us pass through until\
      \ we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “But King Sihon of Heshbon refused to allow us to pass through, because\
      \ the Lord your God made Sihon stubborn and defiant so he could help you defeat\
      \ him, as he has now done. \n"
    31: "³¹ “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Look, I have begun to hand King Sihon and\
      \ his land over to you. Begin now to conquer and occupy his land.’ \n"
    32: '³² “Then King Sihon declared war on us and mobilized his forces at Jahaz. '
    33: '³³ But the Lord our God handed him over to us, and we crushed him, his sons,
      and all his people. '
    34: '³⁴ We conquered all his towns and completely destroyed everyone—men, women,
      and children. Not a single person was spared. '
    35: "³⁵ We took all the livestock as plunder for ourselves, along with anything\
      \ of value from the towns we ransacked. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “The Lord our God also helped us conquer Aroer on the edge of the Arnon
      Gorge, and the town in the gorge, and the whole area as far as Gilead. No town
      had walls too strong for us. '
    37: ³⁷ However, we avoided the land of the Ammonites all along the Jabbok River
      and the towns in the hill country—all the places the Lord our God had commanded
      us to leave alone.
  3:
    1: '¹ “Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan, where King Og and his
      entire army attacked us at Edrei. '
    2: "² But the Lord told me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I have given you victory\
      \ over Og and his entire army, and I will give you all his land. Treat him just\
      \ as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.’ \n"
    3: '³ “So the Lord our God handed King Og and all his people over to us, and we
      killed them all. Not a single person survived. '
    4: '⁴ We conquered all sixty of his towns—the entire Argob region in his kingdom
      of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest. '
    5: '⁵ These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also
      took many unwalled villages at the same time. '
    6: '⁶ We completely destroyed the kingdom of Bashan, just as we had destroyed
      King Sihon of Heshbon. We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered—men,
      women, and children alike. '
    7: "⁷ But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the\
      \ towns. \n"
    8: '⁸ “So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—all
      the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon. '
    9: '⁹ (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it
      Senir.) '
    10: '¹⁰ We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and
      Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og’s kingdom
      in Bashan. '
    11: "¹¹ (King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed\
      \ was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It\
      \ can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.) \n"
    12: '¹² “When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben
      and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill
      country of Gilead with its towns. '
    13: '¹³ Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan—Og’s former kingdom—to
      the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known
      as the land of the Rephaites. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region
      in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair
      renamed this region after himself, calling it the Towns of Jair, as it is still
      known today.) '
    15: '¹⁵ I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir. '
    16: '¹⁶ But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The area
      I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the
      Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier. '
    17: "¹⁷ They also received the Jordan Valley, all the way from the Sea of Galilee\
      \ down to the Dead Sea, with the Jordan River serving as the western boundary.\
      \ To the east were the slopes of Pisgah. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of
      the Jordan: ‘Although the Lord your God has given you this land as your property,
      all your fighting men must cross the Jordan ahead of your Israelite relatives,
      armed and ready to assist them. '
    19: '¹⁹ Your wives, children, and numerous livestock, however, may stay behind
      in the towns I have given you. '
    20: "²⁰ When the Lord has given security to the rest of the Israelites, as he\
      \ has to you, and when they occupy the land the Lord your God is giving them\
      \ across the Jordan River, then you may all return here to the land I have given\
      \ you.’ \n"
    21: '²¹ “At that time I gave Joshua this charge: ‘You have seen for yourself everything
      the Lord your God has done to these two kings. He will do the same to all the
      kingdoms on the west side of the Jordan. '
    22: "²² Do not be afraid of the nations there, for the Lord your God will fight\
      \ for you.’ \n"
    23: '²³ “At that time I pleaded with the Lord and said, '
    24: '²⁴ ‘O Sovereign Lord, you have only begun to show your greatness and the
      strength of your hand to me, your servant. Is there any god in heaven or on
      earth who can perform such great and mighty deeds as you do? '
    25: "²⁵ Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other\
      \ side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and he would not listen
      to me. ‘That’s enough!’ he declared. ‘Speak of it no more. '
    27: '²⁷ But go up to Pisgah Peak, and look over the land in every direction. Take
      a good look, but you may not cross the Jordan River. '
    28: '²⁸ Instead, commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will
      lead the people across the Jordan. He will give them all the land you now see
      before you as their possession.’ '
    29: ²⁹ So we stayed in the valley near Beth-peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ “And now, Israel, listen carefully to these decrees and regulations that
      I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you may live, so you may enter and
      occupy the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. '
    2: "² Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey\
      \ the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you. \n"
    3: '³ “You saw for yourself what the Lord did to you at Baal-peor. There the Lord
      your God destroyed everyone who had worshiped Baal, the god of Peor. '
    4: "⁴ But all of you who were faithful to the Lord your God are still alive today—every\
      \ one of you. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Look, I now teach you these decrees and regulations just as the Lord my
      God commanded me, so that you may obey them in the land you are about to enter
      and occupy. '
    6: '⁶ Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence
      among the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim,
      ‘How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!’ '
    7: '⁷ For what great nation has a god as near to them as the Lord our God is near
      to us whenever we call on him? '
    8: "⁸ And what great nation has decrees and regulations as righteous and fair\
      \ as this body of instructions that I am giving you today? \n"
    9: '⁹ “But watch out! Be careful never to forget what you yourself have seen.
      Do not let these memories escape from your mind as long as you live! And be
      sure to pass them on to your children and grandchildren. '
    10: "¹⁰ Never forget the day when you stood before the Lord your God at Mount\
      \ Sinai, where he told me, ‘Summon the people before me, and I will personally\
      \ instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live, and they\
      \ will teach their children to fear me also.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while flames from
      the mountain shot into the sky. The mountain was shrouded in black clouds and
      deep darkness. '
    12: '¹² And the Lord spoke to you from the heart of the fire. You heard the sound
      of his words but didn’t see his form; there was only a voice. '
    13: '¹³ He proclaimed his covenant—the Ten Commandments—which he commanded you
      to keep, and which he wrote on two stone tablets. '
    14: "¹⁴ It was at that time that the Lord commanded me to teach you his decrees\
      \ and regulations so you would obey them in the land you are about to enter\
      \ and occupy. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But be very careful! You did not see the Lord’s form on the day he spoke
      to you from the heart of the fire at Mount Sinai. '
    16: '¹⁶ So do not corrupt yourselves by making an idol in any form—whether of
      a man or a woman, '
    17: '¹⁷ an animal on the ground, a bird in the sky, '
    18: '¹⁸ a small animal that scurries along the ground, or a fish in the deepest
      sea. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when you look up into the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars—all
      the forces of heaven—don’t be seduced into worshiping them. The Lord your God
      gave them to all the peoples of the earth. '
    20: "²⁰ Remember that the Lord rescued you from the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt\
      \ in order to make you his very own people and his special possession, which\
      \ is what you are today. \n"
    21: '²¹ “But the Lord was angry with me because of you. He vowed that I would
      not cross the Jordan River into the good land the Lord your God is giving you
      as your special possession. '
    22: '²² You will cross the Jordan to occupy the land, but I will not. Instead,
      I will die here on the east side of the river. '
    23: '²³ So be careful not to break the covenant the Lord your God has made with
      you. Do not make idols of any shape or form, for the Lord your God has forbidden
      this. '
    24: "²⁴ The Lord your God is a devouring fire; he is a jealous God. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “In the future, when you have children and grandchildren and have lived\
      \ in the land a long time, do not corrupt yourselves by making idols of any\
      \ kind. This is evil in the sight of the Lord your God and will arouse his anger.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Today I call on heaven and earth as witnesses against you. If you break
      my covenant, you will quickly disappear from the land you are crossing the Jordan
      to occupy. You will live there only a short time; then you will be utterly destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ For the Lord will scatter you among the nations, where only a few of you
      will survive. '
    28: '²⁸ There, in a foreign land, you will worship idols made from wood and stone—gods
      that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. '
    29: "²⁹ But from there you will search again for the Lord your God. And if you\
      \ search for him with all your heart and soul, you will find him. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “In the distant future, when you are suffering all these things, you will
      finally return to the Lord your God and listen to what he tells you. '
    31: "³¹ For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon you or destroy\
      \ you or forget the solemn covenant he made with your ancestors. \n"
    32: '³² “Now search all of history, from the time God created people on the earth
      until now, and search from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything
      as great as this ever been seen or heard before? '
    33: '³³ Has any nation ever heard the voice of God speaking from fire—as you did—and
      survived? '
    34: "³⁴ Has any other god dared to take a nation for himself out of another nation\
      \ by means of trials, miraculous signs, wonders, war, a strong hand, a powerful\
      \ arm, and terrifying acts? Yet that is what the Lord your God did for you in\
      \ Egypt, right before your eyes. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “He showed you these things so you would know that the Lord is God and
      there is no other. '
    36: '³⁶ He let you hear his voice from heaven so he could instruct you. He let
      you see his great fire here on earth so he could speak to you from it. '
    37: '³⁷ Because he loved your ancestors, he chose to bless their descendants,
      and he personally brought you out of Egypt with a great display of power. '
    38: "³⁸ He drove out nations far greater than you, so he could bring you in and\
      \ give you their land as your special possession, as it is today. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “So remember this and keep it firmly in mind: The Lord is God both in
      heaven and on earth, and there is no other. '
    40: "⁴⁰ If you obey all the decrees and commands I am giving you today, all will\
      \ be well with you and your children. I am giving you these instructions so\
      \ you will enjoy a long life in the land the Lord your God is giving you for\
      \ all time.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set apart three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River. '
    42: '⁴² Anyone who killed another person unintentionally, without previous hostility,
      could flee there to live in safety. '
    43: "⁴³ These were the cities: Bezer on the wilderness plateau for the tribe of\
      \ Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad; Golan in Bashan for the tribe\
      \ of Manasseh. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ This is the body of instruction that Moses presented to the Israelites. '
    45: '⁴⁵ These are the laws, decrees, and regulations that Moses gave to the people
      of Israel when they left Egypt, '
    46: '⁴⁶ and as they camped in the valley near Beth-peor east of the Jordan River.
      (This land was formerly occupied by the Amorites under King Sihon, who ruled
      from Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites destroyed him and his people when
      they came up from Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Israel took possession of his land and that of King Og of Bashan—the two
      Amorite kings east of the Jordan. '
    48: '⁴⁸ So Israel conquered the entire area from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon
      Gorge all the way to Mount Sirion, also called Mount Hermon. '
    49: ⁴⁹ And they conquered the eastern bank of the Jordan River as far south as
      the Dead Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah.)
  5:
    1: "¹ Moses called all the people of Israel together and said, “Listen carefully,\
      \ Israel. Hear the decrees and regulations I am giving you today, so you may\
      \ learn them and obey them! \n"
    2: '² “The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Sinai. '
    3: '³ The Lord did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of
      us who are alive today. '
    4: '⁴ At the mountain the Lord spoke to you face to face from the heart of the
      fire. '
    5: "⁵ I stood as an intermediary between you and the Lord, for you were afraid\
      \ of the fire and did not want to approach the mountain. He spoke to me, and\
      \ I passed his words on to you. This is what he said: \n"
    6: "⁶ “I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place\
      \ of your slavery. \n"
    7: "⁷ “You must not have any other god but me. \n"
    8: '⁸ “You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image of anything
      in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. '
    9: '⁹ You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God,
      am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I
      lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even
      children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. '
    10: "¹⁰ But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love\
      \ me and obey my commands. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will not\
      \ let you go unpunished if you misuse his name. \n"
    12: '¹² “Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has
      commanded you. '
    13: '¹³ You have six days each week for your ordinary work, '
    14: '¹⁴ but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your
      God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you,
      your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys
      and other livestock, and any foreigners living among you. All your male and
      female servants must rest as you do. '
    15: "¹⁵ Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought\
      \ you out with his strong hand and powerful arm. That is why the Lord your God\
      \ has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Honor your father and mother, as the Lord your God commanded you. Then\
      \ you will live a long, full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “You must not murder. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “You must not commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “You must not steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “You must not testify falsely against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ “You must not covet your neighbor’s wife. You must not covet your neighbor’s\
      \ house or land, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that\
      \ belongs to your neighbor. \n"
    22: "²² “The Lord spoke these words to all of you assembled there at the foot\
      \ of the mountain. He spoke with a loud voice from the heart of the fire, surrounded\
      \ by clouds and deep darkness. This was all he said at that time, and he wrote\
      \ his words on two stone tablets and gave them to me. \n"
    23: '²³ “But when you heard the voice from the heart of the darkness, while the
      mountain was blazing with fire, all your tribal leaders and elders came to me. '
    24: '²⁴ They said, ‘Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness,
      and we have heard his voice from the heart of the fire. Today we have seen that
      God can speak to us humans, and yet we live! '
    25: '²⁵ But now, why should we risk death again? If the Lord our God speaks to
      us again, we will certainly die and be consumed by this awesome fire. '
    26: '²⁶ Can any living thing hear the voice of the living God from the heart of
      the fire as we did and yet survive? '
    27: "²⁷ Go yourself and listen to what the Lord our God says. Then come and tell\
      \ us everything he tells you, and we will listen and obey.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “The Lord heard the request you made to me. And he said, ‘I have heard
      what the people said to you, and they are right. '
    29: '²⁹ Oh, that they would always have hearts like this, that they might fear
      me and obey all my commands! If they did, they and their descendants would prosper
      forever. '
    30: '³⁰ Go and tell them, “Return to your tents.” '
    31: "³¹ But you stand here with me so I can give you all my commands, decrees,\
      \ and regulations. You must teach them to the people so they can obey them in\
      \ the land I am giving them as their possession.’” \n"
    32: '³² So Moses told the people, “You must be careful to obey all the commands
      of the Lord your God, following his instructions in every detail. '
    33: ³³ Stay on the path that the Lord your God has commanded you to follow. Then
      you will live long and prosperous lives in the land you are about to enter and
      occupy.
  6:
    1: '¹ “These are the commands, decrees, and regulations that the Lord your God
      commanded me to teach you. You must obey them in the land you are about to enter
      and occupy, '
    2: '² and you and your children and grandchildren must fear the Lord your God
      as long as you live. If you obey all his decrees and commands, you will enjoy
      a long life. '
    3: "³ Listen closely, Israel, and be careful to obey. Then all will go well with\
      \ you, and you will have many children in the land flowing with milk and honey,\
      \ just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Listen, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. '
    5: '⁵ And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul,
      and all your strength. '
    6: '⁶ And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am
      giving you today. '
    7: '⁷ Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are
      at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you
      are getting up. '
    8: '⁸ Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. '
    9: "⁹ Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “The Lord your God will soon bring you into the land he swore to give
      you when he made a vow to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is a
      land with large, prosperous cities that you did not build. '
    11: '¹¹ The houses will be richly stocked with goods you did not produce. You
      will draw water from cisterns you did not dig, and you will eat from vineyards
      and olive trees you did not plant. When you have eaten your fill in this land, '
    12: '¹² be careful not to forget the Lord, who rescued you from slavery in the
      land of Egypt. '
    13: "¹³ You must fear the Lord your God and serve him. When you take an oath,\
      \ you must use only his name. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “You must not worship any of the gods of neighboring nations, '
    15: '¹⁵ for the Lord your God, who lives among you, is a jealous God. His anger
      will flare up against you, and he will wipe you from the face of the earth. '
    16: '¹⁶ You must not test the Lord your God as you did when you complained at
      Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ You must diligently obey the commands of the Lord your God—all the laws
      and decrees he has given you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so all will go well with
      you. Then you will enter and occupy the good land that the Lord swore to give
      your ancestors. '
    19: "¹⁹ You will drive out all the enemies living in the land, just as the Lord\
      \ said you would. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “In the future your children will ask you, ‘What is the meaning of these\
      \ laws, decrees, and regulations that the Lord our God has commanded us to obey?’\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ “Then you must tell them, ‘We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, but the
      Lord brought us out of Egypt with his strong hand. '
    22: '²² The Lord did miraculous signs and wonders before our eyes, dealing terrifying
      blows against Egypt and Pharaoh and all his people. '
    23: '²³ He brought us out of Egypt so he could give us this land he had sworn
      to give our ancestors. '
    24: '²⁴ And the Lord our God commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear
      him so he can continue to bless us and preserve our lives, as he has done to
      this day. '
    25: ²⁵ For we will be counted as righteous when we obey all the commands the Lord
      our God has given us.’
  7:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are about to enter
      and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of you: the Hittites, Girgashites,
      Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These seven nations
      are greater and more numerous than you. '
    2: '² When the Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them,
      you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no
      mercy. '
    3: '³ You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry
      their sons and daughters, '
    4: '⁴ for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then
      the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you. '
    5: '⁵ This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter
      their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols. '
    6: "⁶ For you are a holy people, who belong to the Lord your God. Of all the people\
      \ on earth, the Lord your God has chosen you to be his own special treasure.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ “The Lord did not set his heart on you and choose you because you were more
      numerous than other nations, for you were the smallest of all nations! '
    8: '⁸ Rather, it was simply that the Lord loves you, and he was keeping the oath
      he had sworn to your ancestors. That is why the Lord rescued you with such a
      strong hand from your slavery and from the oppressive hand of Pharaoh, king
      of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Understand, therefore, that the Lord your God is indeed God. He is the faithful
      God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing
      love on those who love him and obey his commands. '
    10: '¹⁰ But he does not hesitate to punish and destroy those who reject him. '
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, you must obey all these commands, decrees, and regulations\
      \ I am giving you today. \n"
    12: '¹² “If you listen to these regulations and faithfully obey them, the Lord
      your God will keep his covenant of unfailing love with you, as he promised with
      an oath to your ancestors. '
    13: '¹³ He will love you and bless you, and he will give you many children. He
      will give fertility to your land and your animals. When you arrive in the land
      he swore to give your ancestors, you will have large harvests of grain, new
      wine, and olive oil, and great herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. '
    14: '¹⁴ You will be blessed above all the nations of the earth. None of your men
      or women will be childless, and all your livestock will bear young. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Lord will protect you from all sickness. He will not let you suffer\
      \ from the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on\
      \ all your enemies! \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “You must destroy all the nations the Lord your God hands over to you.
      Show them no mercy, and do not worship their gods, or they will trap you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Perhaps you will think to yourselves, ‘How can we ever conquer these nations
      that are so much more powerful than we are?’ '
    18: '¹⁸ But don’t be afraid of them! Just remember what the Lord your God did
      to Pharaoh and to all the land of Egypt. '
    19: '¹⁹ Remember the great terrors the Lord your God sent against them. You saw
      it all with your own eyes! And remember the miraculous signs and wonders, and
      the strong hand and powerful arm with which he brought you out of Egypt. The
      Lord your God will use this same power against all the people you fear. '
    20: "²⁰ And then the Lord your God will send terror to drive out the few survivors\
      \ still hiding from you! \n"
    21: '²¹ “No, do not be afraid of those nations, for the Lord your God is among
      you, and he is a great and awesome God. '
    22: '²² The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by
      little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals
      would multiply too quickly for you. '
    23: '²³ But the Lord your God will hand them over to you. He will throw them into
      complete confusion until they are destroyed. '
    24: "²⁴ He will put their kings in your power, and you will erase their names\
      \ from the face of the earth. No one will be able to stand against you, and\
      \ you will destroy them all. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver
      or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you,
      for it is detestable to the Lord your God. '
    26: ²⁶ Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be
      destroyed, just like them. You must utterly detest such things, for they are
      set apart for destruction.
  8:
    1: '¹ “Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will
      live and multiply, and you will enter and occupy the land the Lord swore to
      give your ancestors. '
    2: '² Remember how the Lord your God led you through the wilderness for these
      forty years, humbling you and testing you to prove your character, and to find
      out whether or not you would obey his commands. '
    3: '³ Yes, he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna,
      a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors. He did it to teach you
      that people do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes
      from the mouth of the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ For all these forty years your clothes didn’t wear out, and your feet didn’t
      blister or swell. '
    5: "⁵ Think about it: Just as a parent disciplines a child, the Lord your God\
      \ disciplines you for your own good. \n"
    6: '⁶ “So obey the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and fearing
      him. '
    7: '⁷ For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land of flowing streams
      and pools of water, with fountains and springs that gush out in the valleys
      and hills. '
    8: '⁸ It is a land of wheat and barley; of grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates;
      of olive oil and honey. '
    9: '⁹ It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking. It is a land
      where iron is as common as stone, and copper is abundant in the hills. '
    10: "¹⁰ When you have eaten your fill, be sure to praise the Lord your God for\
      \ the good land he has given you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “But that is the time to be careful! Beware that in your plenty you do
      not forget the Lord your God and disobey his commands, regulations, and decrees
      that I am giving you today. '
    12: '¹² For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes
      to live in, '
    13: '¹³ and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver
      and gold have multiplied along with everything else, be careful! '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not become proud at that time and forget the Lord your God, who rescued
      you from slavery in the land of Egypt. '
    15: '¹⁵ Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness
      with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, where it was so hot and dry. He gave
      you water from the rock! '
    16: '¹⁶ He fed you with manna in the wilderness, a food unknown to your ancestors.
      He did this to humble you and test you for your own good. '
    17: '¹⁷ He did all this so you would never say to yourself, ‘I have achieved this
      wealth with my own strength and energy.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ Remember the Lord your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful,\
      \ in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “But I assure you of this: If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow
      other gods, worshiping and bowing down to them, you will certainly be destroyed. '
    20: ²⁰ Just as the Lord has destroyed other nations in your path, you also will
      be destroyed if you refuse to obey the Lord your God.
  9:
    1: '¹ “Listen, O Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River to take
      over the land belonging to nations much greater and more powerful than you.
      They live in cities with walls that reach to the sky! '
    2: '² The people are strong and tall—descendants of the famous Anakite giants.
      You’ve heard the saying, ‘Who can stand up to the Anakites?’ '
    3: "³ But recognize today that the Lord your God is the one who will cross over\
      \ ahead of you like a devouring fire to destroy them. He will subdue them so\
      \ that you will quickly conquer them and drive them out, just as the Lord has\
      \ promised. \n"
    4: '⁴ “After the Lord your God has done this for you, don’t say in your hearts,
      ‘The Lord has given us this land because we are such good people!’ No, it is
      because of the wickedness of the other nations that he is pushing them out of
      your way. '
    5: '⁵ It is not because you are so good or have such integrity that you are about
      to occupy their land. The Lord your God will drive these nations out ahead of
      you only because of their wickedness, and to fulfill the oath he swore to your
      ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. '
    6: "⁶ You must recognize that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land\
      \ because you are good, for you are not—you are a stubborn people. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Remember and never forget how angry you made the Lord your God out in the
      wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until now, you have been constantly
      rebelling against him. '
    8: '⁸ Even at Mount Sinai you made the Lord so angry he was ready to destroy you. '
    9: '⁹ This happened when I was on the mountain receiving the tablets of stone
      inscribed with the words of the covenant that the Lord had made with you. I
      was there for forty days and forty nights, and all that time I ate no food and
      drank no water. '
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord gave me the two tablets on which God had written with his own\
      \ finger all the words he had spoken to you from the heart of the fire when\
      \ you were assembled at the mountain. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “At the end of the forty days and nights, the Lord handed me the two stone
      tablets inscribed with the words of the covenant. '
    12: "¹² Then the Lord said to me, ‘Get up! Go down immediately, for the people\
      \ you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have\
      \ turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted gold and\
      \ made an idol for themselves!’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “The Lord also said to me, ‘I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these
      people are. '
    14: "¹⁴ Leave me alone so I may destroy them and erase their name from under heaven.\
      \ Then I will make a mighty nation of your descendants, a nation larger and\
      \ more powerful than they are.’ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “So while the mountain was blazing with fire I turned and came down, holding
      in my hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant. '
    16: '¹⁶ There below me I could see that you had sinned against the Lord your God.
      You had melted gold and made a calf idol for yourselves. How quickly you had
      turned away from the path the Lord had commanded you to follow! '
    17: "¹⁷ So I took the stone tablets and threw them to the ground, smashing them\
      \ before your eyes. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then, as before, I threw myself down before the Lord for forty days and
      nights. I ate no bread and drank no water because of the great sin you had committed
      by doing what the Lord hated, provoking him to anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ I feared that the furious anger of the Lord, which turned him against
      you, would drive him to destroy you. But again he listened to me. '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord was so angry with Aaron that he wanted to destroy him, too. But
      I prayed for Aaron, and the Lord spared him. '
    21: "²¹ I took your sin—the calf you had made—and I melted it down in the fire\
      \ and ground it into fine dust. Then I threw the dust into the stream that flows\
      \ down the mountain. \n"
    22: '²² “You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah. '
    23: '²³ And at Kadesh-barnea the Lord sent you out with this command: ‘Go up and
      take over the land I have given you.’ But you rebelled against the command of
      the Lord your God and refused to put your trust in him or obey him. '
    24: "²⁴ Yes, you have been rebelling against the Lord as long as I have known\
      \ you. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “That is why I threw myself down before the Lord for forty days and nights—for
      the Lord said he would destroy you. '
    26: '²⁶ I prayed to the Lord and said, ‘O Sovereign Lord, do not destroy them.
      They are your own people. They are your special possession, whom you redeemed
      from Egypt by your mighty power and your strong hand. '
    27: '²⁷ Please overlook the stubbornness and the awful sin of these people, and
      remember instead your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. '
    28: '²⁸ If you destroy these people, the Egyptians will say, “The Israelites died
      because the Lord wasn’t able to bring them to the land he had promised to give
      them.” Or they might say, “He destroyed them because he hated them; he deliberately
      took them into the wilderness to slaughter them.” '
    29: ²⁹ But they are your people and your special possession, whom you brought
      out of Egypt by your great strength and powerful arm.’
  10:
    1: '¹ “At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Chisel out two stone tablets like the
      first ones. Also make a wooden Ark—a sacred chest to store them in. Come up
      to me on the mountain, '
    2: "² and I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the ones you\
      \ smashed. Then place the tablets in the Ark.’ \n"
    3: '³ “So I made an Ark of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first
      two. Then I went up the mountain with the tablets in my hand. '
    4: '⁴ Once again the Lord wrote the Ten Commandments on the tablets and gave them
      to me. They were the same words the Lord had spoken to you from the heart of
      the fire on the day you were assembled at the foot of the mountain. '
    5: "⁵ Then I turned and came down the mountain and placed the tablets in the Ark\
      \ of the Covenant, which I had made, just as the Lord commanded me. And the\
      \ tablets are still there in the Ark.” \n"
    6: '⁶ (The people of Israel set out from the wells of the people of Jaakan and
      traveled to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried. His son Eleazar ministered
      as high priest in his place. '
    7: '⁷ Then they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from there to Jotbathah, a land with
      many brooks and streams. '
    8: '⁸ At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the
      Lord’s Covenant, and to stand before the Lord as his ministers, and to pronounce
      blessings in his name. These are their duties to this day. '
    9: "⁹ That is why the Levites have no share of property or possession of land\
      \ among the other Israelite tribes. The Lord himself is their special possession,\
      \ as the Lord your God told them.) \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “As for me, I stayed on the mountain in the Lord’s presence for forty
      days and nights, as I had done the first time. And once again the Lord listened
      to my pleas and agreed not to destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and resume the journey, and lead the\
      \ people to the land I swore to give to their ancestors, so they may take possession\
      \ of it.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you? He requires
      only that you fear the Lord your God, and live in a way that pleases him, and
      love him and serve him with all your heart and soul. '
    13: "¹³ And you must always obey the Lord’s commands and decrees that I am giving\
      \ you today for your own good. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Look, the highest heavens and the earth and everything in it all belong
      to the Lord your God. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yet the Lord chose your ancestors as the objects of his love. And he chose
      you, their descendants, above all other nations, as is evident today. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore, change your hearts and stop being stubborn. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the
      great God, the mighty and awesome God, who shows no partiality and cannot be
      bribed. '
    18: '¹⁸ He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the
      foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ So you, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once
      foreigners in the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ You must fear the Lord your God and worship him and cling to him. Your
      oaths must be in his name alone. '
    21: '²¹ He alone is your God, the only one who is worthy of your praise, the one
      who has done these mighty miracles that you have seen with your own eyes. '
    22: ²² When your ancestors went down into Egypt, there were only seventy of them.
      But now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky!
  11:
    1: '¹ “You must love the Lord your God and always obey his requirements, decrees,
      regulations, and commands. '
    2: '² Keep in mind that I am not talking now to your children, who have never
      experienced the discipline of the Lord your God or seen his greatness and his
      strong hand and powerful arm. '
    3: '³ They didn’t see the miraculous signs and wonders he performed in Egypt against
      Pharaoh and all his land. '
    4: "⁴ They didn’t see what the Lord did to the armies of Egypt and to their horses\
      \ and chariots—how he drowned them in the Red Sea as they were chasing you.\
      \ He destroyed them, and they have not recovered to this very day! \n"
    5: '⁵ “Your children didn’t see how the Lord cared for you in the wilderness until
      you arrived here. '
    6: '⁶ They didn’t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram (the sons of Eliab, a descendant
      of Reuben) when the earth opened its mouth in the Israelite camp and swallowed
      them, along with their households and tents and every living thing that belonged
      to them. '
    7: "⁷ But you have seen the Lord perform all these mighty deeds with your own\
      \ eyes! \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore, be careful to obey every command I am giving you today, so you
      may have strength to go in and take over the land you are about to enter. '
    9: '⁹ If you obey, you will enjoy a long life in the land the Lord swore to give
      to your ancestors and to you, their descendants—a land flowing with milk and
      honey! '
    10: '¹⁰ For the land you are about to enter and take over is not like the land
      of Egypt from which you came, where you planted your seed and made irrigation
      ditches with your foot as in a vegetable garden. '
    11: '¹¹ Rather, the land you will soon take over is a land of hills and valleys
      with plenty of rain— '
    12: "¹² a land that the Lord your God cares for. He watches over it through each\
      \ season of the year! \n"
    13: '¹³ “If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today, and if you
      love the Lord your God and serve him with all your heart and soul, '
    14: '¹⁴ then he will send the rains in their proper seasons—the early and late
      rains—so you can bring in your harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil. '
    15: "¹⁵ He will give you lush pastureland for your livestock, and you yourselves\
      \ will have all you want to eat. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But be careful. Don’t let your heart be deceived so that you turn away
      from the Lord and serve and worship other gods. '
    17: "¹⁷ If you do, the Lord’s anger will burn against you. He will shut up the\
      \ sky and hold back the rain, and the ground will fail to produce its harvests.\
      \ Then you will quickly die in that good land the Lord is giving you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words of mine. Tie them
      to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. '
    19: '¹⁹ Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and
      when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting
      up. '
    20: '²⁰ Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, '
    21: "²¹ so that as long as the sky remains above the earth, you and your children\
      \ may flourish in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors. \n"
    22: '²² “Be careful to obey all these commands I am giving you. Show love to the
      Lord your God by walking in his ways and holding tightly to him. '
    23: '²³ Then the Lord will drive out all the nations ahead of you, though they
      are much greater and stronger than you, and you will take over their land. '
    24: '²⁴ Wherever you set foot, that land will be yours. Your frontiers will stretch
      from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates
      River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. '
    25: "²⁵ No one will be able to stand against you, for the Lord your God will cause\
      \ the people to fear and dread you, as he promised, wherever you go in the whole\
      \ land. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Look, today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse! '
    27: '²⁷ You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that
      I am giving you today. '
    28: "²⁸ But you will be cursed if you reject the commands of the Lord your God\
      \ and turn away from him and worship gods you have not known before. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When the Lord your God brings you into the land and helps you take possession
      of it, you must pronounce the blessing at Mount Gerizim and the curse at Mount
      Ebal. '
    30: '³⁰ (These two mountains are west of the Jordan River in the land of the Canaanites
      who live in the Jordan Valley, near the town of Gilgal, not far from the oaks
      of Moreh.) '
    31: '³¹ For you are about to cross the Jordan River to take over the land the
      Lord your God is giving you. When you take that land and are living in it, '
    32: ³² you must be careful to obey all the decrees and regulations I am giving
      you today.
  12:
    1: "¹ “These are the decrees and regulations you must be careful to obey when\
      \ you live in the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.\
      \ You must obey them as long as you live. \n"
    2: '² “When you drive out the nations that live there, you must destroy all the
      places where they worship their gods—high on the mountains, up on the hills,
      and under every green tree. '
    3: "³ Break down their altars and smash their sacred pillars. Burn their Asherah\
      \ poles and cut down their carved idols. Completely erase the names of their\
      \ gods! \n"
    4: '⁴ “Do not worship the Lord your God in the way these pagan peoples worship
      their gods. '
    5: '⁵ Rather, you must seek the Lord your God at the place of worship he himself
      will choose from among all the tribes—the place where his name will be honored. '
    6: '⁶ There you will bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes,
      your sacred offerings, your offerings to fulfill a vow, your voluntary offerings,
      and your offerings of the firstborn animals of your herds and flocks. '
    7: "⁷ There you and your families will feast in the presence of the Lord your\
      \ God, and you will rejoice in all you have accomplished because the Lord your\
      \ God has blessed you. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Your pattern of worship will change. Today all of you are doing as you
      please, '
    9: '⁹ because you have not yet arrived at the place of rest, the land the Lord
      your God is giving you as your special possession. '
    10: '¹⁰ But you will soon cross the Jordan River and live in the land the Lord
      your God is giving you. When he gives you rest from all your enemies and you’re
      living safely in the land, '
    11: "¹¹ you must bring everything I command you—your burnt offerings, your sacrifices,\
      \ your tithes, your sacred offerings, and your offerings to fulfill a vow—to\
      \ the designated place of worship, the place the Lord your God chooses for his\
      \ name to be honored. \n"
    12: '¹² “You must celebrate there in the presence of the Lord your God with your
      sons and daughters and all your servants. And remember to include the Levites
      who live in your towns, for they will receive no allotment of land among you. '
    13: '¹³ Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you like. '
    14: "¹⁴ You may do so only at the place the Lord will choose within one of your\
      \ tribal territories. There you must offer your burnt offerings and do everything\
      \ I command you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But you may butcher your animals and eat their meat in any town whenever
      you want. You may freely eat the animals with which the Lord your God blesses
      you. All of you, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just
      as you now eat gazelle and deer. '
    16: "¹⁶ But you must not consume the blood. You must pour it out on the ground\
      \ like water. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “But you may not eat your offerings in your hometown—neither the tithe
      of your grain and new wine and olive oil, nor the firstborn of your flocks and
      herds, nor any offering to fulfill a vow, nor your voluntary offerings, nor
      your sacred offerings. '
    18: '¹⁸ You must eat these in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he
      will choose. Eat them there with your children, your servants, and the Levites
      who live in your towns, celebrating in the presence of the Lord your God in
      all you do. '
    19: "¹⁹ And be very careful never to neglect the Levites as long as you live in\
      \ your land. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “When the Lord your God expands your territory as he has promised, and
      you have the urge to eat meat, you may freely eat meat whenever you want. '
    21: '²¹ It might happen that the designated place of worship—the place the Lord
      your God chooses for his name to be honored—is a long way from your home. If
      so, you may butcher any of the cattle, sheep, or goats the Lord has given you,
      and you may freely eat the meat in your hometown, as I have commanded you. '
    22: '²² Anyone, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just
      as you do now with gazelle and deer. '
    23: '²³ But never consume the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not
      consume the lifeblood with the meat. '
    24: '²⁴ Instead, pour out the blood on the ground like water. '
    25: "²⁵ Do not consume the blood, so that all may go well with you and your children\
      \ after you, because you will be doing what pleases the Lord. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Take your sacred gifts and your offerings given to fulfill a vow to the
      place the Lord chooses. '
    27: '²⁷ You must offer the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar
      of the Lord your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out
      on the altar of the Lord your God, but you may eat the meat. '
    28: "²⁸ Be careful to obey all my commands, so that all will go well with you\
      \ and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and pleasing\
      \ to the Lord your God. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When the Lord your God goes ahead of you and destroys the nations and
      you drive them out and live in their land, '
    30: '³⁰ do not fall into the trap of following their customs and worshiping their
      gods. Do not inquire about their gods, saying, ‘How do these nations worship
      their gods? I want to follow their example.’ '
    31: "³¹ You must not worship the Lord your God the way the other nations worship\
      \ their gods, for they perform for their gods every detestable act that the\
      \ Lord hates. They even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to their\
      \ gods. \n"
    32: ³² “So be careful to obey all the commands I give you. You must not add anything
      to them or subtract anything from them.
  13:
    1: '¹ “Suppose there are prophets among you or those who dream dreams about the
      future, and they promise you signs or miracles, '
    2: '² and the predicted signs or miracles occur. If they then say, ‘Come, let

      to his voice, and cling to him. '

      \ you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt. Since they try\
      \ to lead you astray from the way the Lord your God commanded you to live, you\
      \ must put them to death. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Suppose someone secretly entices you—even your brother, your son or daughter,
      your beloved wife, or your closest friend—and says, ‘Let us go worship other
      gods’—gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known. '
    7: '⁷ They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby
      or who come from the ends of the earth. '
    8: '⁸ But do not give in or listen. Have no pity, and do not spare or protect
      them. '
    9: '⁹ You must put them to death! Strike the first blow yourself, and then all

    10: '¹⁰ Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away

    14: '¹⁴ In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that
      the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you, '
    15: '¹⁵ you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants,
      as well as all the livestock. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and
      burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That

    17: "¹⁷ Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then\

    11: "¹¹ There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding\
      \ you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need. \n"
    12: "¹² “If a fellow Hebrew sells himself or herself to be your servant and serves\
      \ you for six years, in the seventh year you must set that servant free. \n"
    13: '¹³ “When you release a male servant, do not send him away empty-handed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Give him a generous farewell gift from your flock, your threshing floor,
      and your winepress. Share with him some of the bounty with which the Lord your
      God has blessed you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt and the Lord your\
      \ God redeemed you! That is why I am giving you this command. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But suppose your servant says, ‘I will not leave you,’ because he loves
      you and your family, and he has done well with you. '
    17: "¹⁷ In that case, take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door.\
      \ After that, he will be your servant for life. And do the same for your female\
      \ servants. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “You must not consider it a hardship when you release your servants. Remember\
      \ that for six years they have given you services worth double the wages of\
      \ hired workers, and the Lord your God will bless you in all you do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “You must set aside for the Lord your God all the firstborn males from
      your flocks and herds. Do not use the firstborn of your herds to work your fields,
      and do not shear the firstborn of your flocks. '
    20: '²⁰ Instead, you and your family must eat these animals in the presence of
      the Lord your God each year at the place he chooses. '
    21: '²¹ But if this firstborn animal has any defect, such as lameness or blindness,
      or if anything else is wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord
      your God. '
    22: '²² Instead, use it for food for your family in your hometown. Anyone, whether
      ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat it, just as anyone may eat a gazelle
      or deer. '
    23: ²³ But you must not consume the blood. You must pour it out on the ground
      like water.
  16:
    1: '¹ “In honor of the Lord your God, celebrate the Passover each year in the
      early spring, in the month of Abib, for that was the month in which the Lord
      your God brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² Your Passover sacrifice may be from either the flock or the herd, and it
      must be sacrificed to the Lord your God at the designated place of worship—the
      place he chooses for his name to be honored. '
    3: '³ Eat it with bread made without yeast. For seven days the bread you eat must
      be made without yeast, as when you escaped from Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this
      bread—the bread of suffering—so that as long as you live you will remember the
      day you departed from Egypt. '
    4: "⁴ Let no yeast be found in any house throughout your land for those seven\
      \ days. And when you sacrifice the Passover lamb on the evening of the first\
      \ day, do not let any of the meat remain until the next morning. \n"
    5: '⁵ “You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of the towns that the Lord
      your God is giving you. '
    6: '⁶ You must offer it only at the designated place of worship—the place the
      Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored. Sacrifice it there in the
      evening as the sun goes down on the anniversary of your exodus from Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ Roast the lamb and eat it in the place the Lord your God chooses. Then you
      may go back to your tents the next morning. '
    8: "⁸ For the next six days you may not eat any bread made with yeast. On the\
      \ seventh day proclaim another holy day in honor of the Lord your God, and no\
      \ work may be done on that day. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Count off seven weeks from when you first begin to cut the grain at the
      time of harvest. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then celebrate the Festival of Harvest to honor the Lord your God. Bring
      him a voluntary offering in proportion to the blessings you have received from
      him. '
    11: '¹¹ This is a time to celebrate before the Lord your God at the designated
      place of worship he will choose for his name to be honored. Celebrate with your
      sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites from your towns,
      and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live among you. '
    12: "¹² Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, so be careful to obey all\
      \ these decrees. \n"
    13: '¹³ “You must observe the Festival of Shelters for seven days at the end of
      the harvest season, after the grain has been threshed and the grapes have been
      pressed. '
    14: '¹⁴ This festival will be a happy time of celebrating with your sons and daughters,
      your male and female servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows
      from your towns. '
    15: "¹⁵ For seven days you must celebrate this festival to honor the Lord your\
      \ God at the place he chooses, for it is he who blesses you with bountiful harvests\
      \ and gives you success in all your work. This festival will be a time of great\
      \ joy for all. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Each year every man in Israel must celebrate these three festivals: the
      Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters.
      On each of these occasions, all men must appear before the Lord your God at
      the place he chooses, but they must not appear before the Lord without a gift
      for him. '
    17: "¹⁷ All must give as they are able, according to the blessings given to them\
      \ by the Lord your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Appoint judges and officials for yourselves from each of your tribes
      in all the towns the Lord your God is giving you. They must judge the people
      fairly. '
    19: '¹⁹ You must never twist justice or show partiality. Never accept a bribe,
      for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the decisions of the godly. '
    20: "²⁰ Let true justice prevail, so you may live and occupy the land that the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    21: '²¹ “You must never set up a wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build
      for the Lord your God. '
    22: ²² And never set up sacred pillars for worship, for the Lord your God hates
      them.
  17:
    1: "¹ “Never sacrifice sick or defective cattle, sheep, or goats to the Lord your\
      \ God, for he detests such gifts. \n"
    2: '² “When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you, a man
      or woman among you might do evil in the sight of the Lord your God and violate
      the covenant. '
    3: '³ For instance, they might serve other gods or worship the sun, the moon,
      or any of the stars—the forces of heaven—which I have strictly forbidden. '
    4: '⁴ When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true
      that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ then the man or woman who has committed such an evil act must be taken to
      the gates of the town and stoned to death. '
    6: '⁶ But never put a person to death on the testimony of only one witness. There
      must always be two or three witnesses. '
    7: "⁷ The witnesses must throw the first stones, and then all the people may join\
      \ in. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Suppose a case arises in a local court that is too hard for you to decide—for
      instance, whether someone is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter, or a
      difficult lawsuit, or a case involving different kinds of assault. Take such
      legal cases to the place the Lord your God will choose, '
    9: '⁹ and present them to the Levitical priests or the judge on duty at that time.
      They will hear the case and declare the verdict. '
    10: '¹⁰ You must carry out the verdict they announce and the sentence they prescribe
      at the place the Lord chooses. You must do exactly what they say. '
    11: '¹¹ After they have interpreted the law and declared their verdict, the sentence
      they impose must be fully executed; do not modify it in any way. '
    12: '¹² Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest
      who represents the Lord your God must die. In this way you will purge the evil
      from Israel. '
    13: "¹³ Then everyone else will hear about it and be afraid to act so arrogantly.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “You are about to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. When
      you take it over and settle there, you may think, ‘We should select a king to
      rule over us like the other nations around us.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ If this happens, be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God chooses.\
      \ You must appoint a fellow Israelite; he may not be a foreigner. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send
      his people to Egypt to buy horses, for the Lord has told you, ‘You must never
      return to Egypt.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ The king must not take many wives for himself, because they will turn\
      \ his heart away from the Lord. And he must not accumulate large amounts of\
      \ wealth in silver and gold for himself. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body
      of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. '
    19: '¹⁹ He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he
      lives. That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms
      of these instructions and decrees. '
    20: ²⁰ This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as
      if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away
      from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his
      descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.
  18:
    1: '¹ “Remember that the Levitical priests—that is, the whole of the tribe of
      Levi—will receive no allotment of land among the other tribes in Israel. Instead,
      the priests and Levites will eat from the special gifts given to the Lord, for
      that is their share. '
    2: "² They will have no land of their own among the Israelites. The Lord himself\
      \ is their special possession, just as he promised them. \n"
    3: '³ “These are the parts the priests may claim as their share from the cattle,
      sheep, and goats that the people bring as offerings: the shoulder, the cheeks,
      and the stomach. '
    4: '⁴ You must also give to the priests the first share of the grain, the new
      wine, the olive oil, and the wool at shearing time. '
    5: "⁵ For the Lord your God chose the tribe of Levi out of all your tribes to\
      \ minister in the Lord’s name forever. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Suppose a Levite chooses to move from his town in Israel, wherever he is
      living, to the place the Lord chooses for worship. '
    7: '⁷ He may minister there in the name of the Lord his God, just like all his
      fellow Levites who are serving the Lord there. '
    8: "⁸ He may eat his share of the sacrifices and offerings, even if he also receives\
      \ support from his family. \n"
    9: '⁹ “When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, be very careful
      not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there. '
    10: '¹⁰ For example, never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering.
      And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret
      omens, or engage in witchcraft, '
    11: '¹¹ or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the
      spirits of the dead. '
    12: '¹² Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. It is because
      the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will
      drive them out ahead of you. '
    13: '¹³ But you must be blameless before the Lord your God. '
    14: "¹⁴ The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers,\
      \ but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Moses continued, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like
      me from among your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. '
    16: "¹⁶ For this is what you yourselves requested of the Lord your God when you\
      \ were assembled at Mount Sinai. You said, ‘Don’t let us hear the voice of the\
      \ Lord our God anymore or see this blazing fire, for we will die.’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Then the Lord said to me, ‘What they have said is right. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites.
      I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell the people everything I command
      him. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages
      the prophet proclaims on my behalf. '
    20: "²⁰ But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in\
      \ the name of another god must die.’ \n"
    21: '²¹ “But you may wonder, ‘How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from
      the Lord?’ '
    22: ²² If the prophet speaks in the Lord’s name but his prediction does not happen
      or come true, you will know that the Lord did not give that message. That prophet
      has spoken without my authority and need not be feared.
  19:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God destroys the nations whose land he is giving you,
      you will take over their land and settle in their towns and homes. '
    2: '² Then you must set apart three cities of refuge in the land the Lord your
      God is giving you. '
    3: "³ Survey the territory, and divide the land the Lord your God is giving you\
      \ into three districts, with one of these cities in each district. Then anyone\
      \ who has killed someone can flee to one of the cities of refuge for safety.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ “If someone kills another person unintentionally, without previous hostility,
      the slayer may flee to any of these cities to live in safety. '
    5: "⁵ For example, suppose someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to cut\
      \ wood. And suppose one of them swings an ax to chop down a tree, and the ax\
      \ head flies off the handle, killing the other person. In such cases, the slayer\
      \ may flee to one of the cities of refuge to live in safety. \n"
    6: '⁶ “If the distance to the nearest city of refuge is too far, an enraged avenger
      might be able to chase down and kill the person who caused the death. Then the
      slayer would die unfairly, since he had never shown hostility toward the person
      who died. '
    7: "⁷ That is why I am commanding you to set aside three cities of refuge. \n"
    8: '⁸ “And if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors,
      and gives you all the land he promised them, '
    9: '⁹ you must designate three additional cities of refuge. (He will give you
      this land if you are careful to obey all the commands I have given you—if you
      always love the Lord your God and walk in his ways.) '
    10: "¹⁰ That way you will prevent the death of innocent people in the land the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you as your special possession. You will not be held\
      \ responsible for the death of innocent people. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “But suppose someone is hostile toward a neighbor and deliberately ambushes
      and murders him and then flees to one of the cities of refuge. '
    12: '¹² In that case, the elders of the murderer’s hometown must send agents to
      the city of refuge to bring him back and hand him over to the dead person’s
      avenger to be put to death. '
    13: "¹³ Do not feel sorry for that murderer! Purge from Israel the guilt of murdering\
      \ innocent people; then all will go well with you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “When you arrive in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special\
      \ possession, you must never steal anyone’s land by moving the boundary markers\
      \ your ancestors set up to mark their property. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “You must not convict anyone of a crime on the testimony of only one witness.\
      \ The facts of the case must be established by the testimony of two or three\
      \ witnesses. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “If a malicious witness comes forward and accuses someone of a crime, '
    17: '¹⁷ then both the accuser and accused must appear before the Lord by coming
      to the priests and judges in office at that time. '
    18: '¹⁸ The judges must investigate the case thoroughly. If the accuser has brought
      false charges against his fellow Israelite, '
    19: '¹⁹ you must impose on the accuser the sentence he intended for the other
      person. In this way, you will purge such evil from among you. '
    20: '²⁰ Then the rest of the people will hear about it and be afraid to do such
      an evil thing. '
    21: ²¹ You must show no pity for the guilty! Your rule should be life for life,
      eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
  20:
    1: '¹ “When you go out to fight your enemies and you face horses and chariots
      and an army greater than your own, do not be afraid. The Lord your God, who
      brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you! '
    2: '² When you prepare for battle, the priest must come forward to speak to the
      troops. '
    3: '³ He will say to them, ‘Listen to me, all you men of Israel! Do not be afraid
      as you go out to fight your enemies today! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble
      before them. '
    4: "⁴ For the Lord your God is going with you! He will fight for you against your\
      \ enemies, and he will give you victory!’ \n"
    5: '⁵ “Then the officers of the army must address the troops and say, ‘Has anyone
      here just built a new house but not yet dedicated it? If so, you may go home!
      You might be killed in the battle, and someone else would dedicate your house. '
    6: '⁶ Has anyone here just planted a vineyard but not yet eaten any of its fruit?
      If so, you may go home! You might die in battle, and someone else would eat
      the first fruit. '
    7: "⁷ Has anyone here just become engaged to a woman but not yet married her?\
      \ Well, you may go home and get married! You might die in the battle, and someone\
      \ else would marry her.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Then the officers will also say, ‘Is anyone here afraid or worried? If
      you are, you may go home before you frighten anyone else.’ '
    9: "⁹ When the officers have finished speaking to their troops, they will appoint\
      \ the unit commanders. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “As you approach a town to attack it, you must first offer its people
      terms for peace. '
    11: '¹¹ If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people
      inside will serve you in forced labor. '
    12: '¹² But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack
      the town. '
    13: '¹³ When the Lord your God hands the town over to you, use your swords to
      kill every man in the town. '
    14: "¹⁴ But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and\
      \ other plunder. You may enjoy the plunder from your enemies that the Lord your\
      \ God has given you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “But these instructions apply only to distant towns, not to the towns
      of the nations in the land you will enter. '
    16: '¹⁶ In those towns that the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession,
      destroy every living thing. '
    17: '¹⁷ You must completely destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
      Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you. '
    18: "¹⁸ This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate\
      \ their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you\
      \ to sin deeply against the Lord your God. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “When you are attacking a town and the war drags on, you must not cut
      down the trees with your axes. You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the
      trees. Are the trees your enemies, that you should attack them? '
    20: ²⁰ You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food. Use
      them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls.
  21:
    1: '¹ “When you are in the land the Lord your God is giving you, someone may be
      found murdered in a field, and you don’t know who committed the murder. '
    2: '² In such a case, your elders and judges must measure the distance from the
      site of the crime to the nearby towns. '
    3: '³ When the nearest town has been determined, that town’s elders must select
      from the herd a heifer that has never been trained or yoked to a plow. '
    4: '⁴ They must lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and
      that has a stream running through it. There in the valley they must break the
      heifer’s neck. '
    5: "⁵ Then the Levitical priests must step forward, for the Lord your God has\
      \ chosen them to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in the Lord’s\
      \ name. They are to decide all legal and criminal cases. \n"
    6: '⁶ “The elders of the town must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck
      was broken. '
    7: '⁷ Then they must say, ‘Our hands did not shed this person’s blood, nor did
      we see it happen. '
    8: '⁸ O Lord, forgive your people Israel whom you have redeemed. Do not charge
      your people with the guilt of murdering an innocent person.’ Then they will
      be absolved of the guilt of this person’s blood. '
    9: "⁹ By following these instructions, you will do what is right in the Lord’s\
      \ sight and will cleanse the guilt of murder from your community. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Suppose you go out to war against your enemies and the Lord your God
      hands them over to you, and you take some of them as captives. '
    11: '¹¹ And suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are
      attracted to her and want to marry her. '
    12: '¹² If this happens, you may take her to your home, where she must shave her
      head, cut her nails, '
    13: '¹³ and change the clothes she was wearing when she was captured. She will
      stay in your home, but let her mourn for her father and mother for a full month.
      Then you may marry her, and you will be her husband and she will be your wife. '
    14: "¹⁴ But if you marry her and she does not please you, you must let her go\
      \ free. You may not sell her or treat her as a slave, for you have humiliated\
      \ her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Suppose a man has two wives, but he loves one and not the other, and
      both have given him sons. And suppose the firstborn son is the son of the wife
      he does not love. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the man divides his inheritance, he may not give the larger inheritance
      to his younger son, the son of the wife he loves, as if he were the firstborn
      son. '
    17: "¹⁷ He must recognize the rights of his oldest son, the son of the wife he\
      \ does not love, by giving him a double portion. He is the first son of his\
      \ father’s virility, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Suppose a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his
      father or mother, even though they discipline him. '
    19: '¹⁹ In such a case, the father and mother must take the son to the elders
      as they hold court at the town gate. '
    20: '²⁰ The parents must say to the elders, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and
      rebellious and refuses to obey. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ '
    21: "²¹ Then all the men of his town must stone him to death. In this way, you\

    22: '²² “If someone has committed a crime worthy of death and is executed and
      hung on a tree, '
    23: ²³ the body must not remain hanging from the tree overnight. You must bury
      the body that same day, for anyone who is hung is cursed in the sight of God.
      In this way, you will prevent the defilement of the land the Lord your God is
      giving you as your special possession.
  22:
    1: '¹ “If you see your neighbor’s ox or sheep or goat wandering away, don’t ignore

    15: "¹⁵ “But if you refuse to listen to the Lord your God and do not obey all\
      \ the commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come\

    16: "¹⁶ Your towns and your fields\n    will be cursed.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your fruit baskets and breadboards\n    will be cursed.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your children and your crops\n    will be cursed.\nThe offspring of your\
      \ herds and flocks\n    will be cursed.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Wherever you go and whatever you do,\n    you will be cursed. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “The Lord himself will send on you curses, confusion, and frustration
      in everything you do, until at last you are completely destroyed for doing evil
      and abandoning me. '
    21: '²¹ The Lord will afflict you with diseases until none of you are left in
      the land you are about to enter and occupy. '
    22: '²² The Lord will strike you with wasting diseases, fever, and inflammation,
      with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew. These disasters
      will pursue you until you die. '
    23: '²³ The skies above will be as unyielding as bronze, and the earth beneath
      will be as hard as iron. '
    24: "²⁴ The Lord will change the rain that falls on your land into powder, and\
      \ dust will pour down from the sky until you are destroyed. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “The Lord will cause you to be defeated by your enemies. You will attack
      your enemies from one direction, but you will scatter from them in seven! You
      will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    26: "²⁶ Your corpses will be food for all the scavenging birds and wild animals,\

    27: '²⁷ “The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, scurvy,
      and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. '
    28: '²⁸ The Lord will strike you with madness, blindness, and panic. '
    29: "²⁹ You will grope around in broad daylight like a blind person groping in\
      \ the darkness, but you will not find your way. You will be oppressed and robbed\
      \ continually, and no one will come to save you. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “You will be engaged to a woman, but another man will sleep with her.
      You will build a house, but someone else will live in it. You will plant a vineyard,
      but you will never enjoy its fruit. '
    31: '³¹ Your ox will be butchered before your eyes, but you will not eat a single
      bite of the meat. Your donkey will be taken from you, never to be returned.
      Your sheep and goats will be given to your enemies, and no one will be there
      to help you. '
    32: '³² You will watch as your sons and daughters are taken away as slaves. Your
      heart will break for them, but you won’t be able to help them. '
    33: '³³ A foreign nation you have never heard about will eat the crops you worked
      so hard to grow. You will suffer under constant oppression and harsh treatment. '
    34: '³⁴ You will go mad because of all the tragedy you see around you. '
    35: "³⁵ The Lord will cover your knees and legs with incurable boils. In fact,\
      \ you will be covered from head to foot. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “The Lord will exile you and your king to a nation unknown to you and
      your ancestors. There in exile you will worship gods of wood and stone! '
    37: "³⁷ You will become an object of horror, ridicule, and mockery among all the\
      \ nations to which the Lord sends you. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “You will plant much but harvest little, for locusts will eat your crops. '
    39: '³⁹ You will plant vineyards and care for them, but you will not drink the
      wine or eat the grapes, for worms will destroy the vines. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You will grow olive trees throughout your land, but you will never use
      the olive oil, for the fruit will drop before it ripens. '
    41: '⁴¹ You will have sons and daughters, but you will lose them, for they will
      be led away into captivity. '

      forever. '
    47: '⁴⁷ If you do not serve the Lord your God with joy and enthusiasm for the
      abundant benefits you have received, '
    48: "⁴⁸ you will serve your enemies whom the Lord will send against you. You will\
      \ be left hungry, thirsty, naked, and lacking in everything. The Lord will put\

      \ \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ “The Lord will bring a distant nation against you from the end of the
      earth, and it will swoop down on you like a vulture. It is a nation whose language
      you do not understand, '
    50: '⁵⁰ a fierce and heartless nation that shows no respect for the old and no
      pity for the young. '
    51: '⁵¹ Its armies will devour your livestock and crops, and you will be destroyed.
      They will leave you no grain, new wine, olive oil, calves, or lambs, and you
      will starve to death. '
    52: "⁵² They will attack your cities until all the fortified walls in your land—the\
      \ walls you trusted to protect you—are knocked down. They will attack all the\
      \ towns in the land the Lord your God has given you. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “The siege and terrible distress of the enemy’s attack will be so severe
      that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters, whom the Lord your
      God has given you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ The most tenderhearted man among you will have no compassion for his own
      brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving children. '
    55: '⁵⁵ He will refuse to share with them the flesh he is devouring—the flesh
      of one of his own children—because he has nothing else to eat during the siege
      and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns. '
    56: '⁵⁶ The most tender and delicate woman among you—so delicate she would not
      so much as touch the ground with her foot—will be selfish toward the husband
      she loves and toward her own son or daughter. '
    57: "⁵⁷ She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne,\
      \ so that she herself can secretly eat them. She will have nothing else to eat\
      \ during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all\
      \ your towns. \n"
    58: '⁵⁸ “If you refuse to obey all the words of instruction that are written in
      this book, and if you do not fear the glorious and awesome name of the Lord
      your God, '
    59: '⁵⁹ then the Lord will overwhelm you and your children with indescribable
      plagues. These plagues will be intense and without relief, making you miserable
      and unbearably sick. '
    60: '⁶⁰ He will afflict you with all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so
      much, and you will have no relief. '
    61: '⁶¹ The Lord will afflict you with every sickness and plague there is, even
      those not mentioned in this Book of Instruction, until you are destroyed. '
    62: "⁶² Though you become as numerous as the stars in the sky, few of you will\
      \ be left because you would not listen to the Lord your God. \n"
    63: '⁶³ “Just as the Lord has found great pleasure in causing you to prosper and
      multiply, the Lord will find pleasure in destroying you. You will be torn from
      the land you are about to enter and occupy. '
    64: '⁶⁴ For the Lord will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the
      earth to the other. There you will worship foreign gods that neither you nor
      your ancestors have known, gods made of wood and stone! '
    65: '⁶⁵ There among those nations you will find no peace or place to rest. And
      the Lord will cause your heart to tremble, your eyesight to fail, and your soul
      to despair. '
    66: '⁶⁶ Your life will constantly hang in the balance. You will live night and
      day in fear, unsure if you will survive. '
    67: '⁶⁷ In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were night!’ And in the evening
      you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’ For you will be terrified by the awful
      horrors you see around you. '
    68: ⁶⁸ Then the Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships, to a destination I
      promised you would never see again. There you will offer to sell yourselves
      to your enemies as slaves, but no one will buy you.”
  29:
    1: "¹ These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with\
      \ the Israelites while they were in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant\
      \ he had made with them at Mount Sinai. \n"
    2: '² Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, “You have seen with
      your own eyes everything the Lord did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to
      all his servants and to his whole country— '
    3: '³ all the great tests of strength, the miraculous signs, and the amazing wonders. '
    4: '⁴ But to this day the Lord has not given you minds that understand, nor eyes
      that see, nor ears that hear! '
    5: '⁵ For forty years I led you through the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals
      did not wear out. '
    6: "⁶ You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink, but he provided\
      \ for you so you would know that he is the Lord your God. \n"
    7: '⁷ “When we came here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out
      to fight against us, but we defeated them. '
    8: "⁸ We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the\
      \ half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Therefore, obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in
      everything you do. '
    10: '¹⁰ All of you—tribal leaders, elders, officers, all the men of Israel—are
      standing today in the presence of the Lord your God. '
    11: '¹¹ Your little ones and your wives are with you, as well as the foreigners
      living among you who chop your wood and carry your water. '
    12: '¹² You are standing here today to enter into the covenant of the Lord your
      God. The Lord is making this covenant, including the curses. '
    13: "¹³ By entering into the covenant today, he will establish you as his people\
      \ and confirm that he is your God, just as he promised you and as he swore to\
      \ your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But you are not the only ones with whom I am making this covenant with
      its curses. '
    15: "¹⁵ I am making this covenant both with you who stand here today in the presence\
      \ of the Lord our God, and also with the future generations who are not standing\
      \ here today. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through
      the lands of enemy nations as we left. '
    17: '¹⁷ You have seen their detestable practices and their idols made of wood,
      stone, silver, and gold. '
    18: "¹⁸ I am making this covenant with you so that no one among you—no man, woman,\
      \ clan, or tribe—will turn away from the Lord our God to worship these gods\
      \ of other nations, and so that no root among you bears bitter and poisonous\
      \ fruit. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves,
      thinking, ‘I am safe, even though I am following the desires of my own stubborn
      heart.’ This would lead to utter ruin! '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord will never pardon such people. Instead his anger and jealousy
      will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will come down on
      them, and the Lord will erase their names from under heaven. '
    21: "²¹ The Lord will separate them from all the tribes of Israel, to pour out\
      \ on them all the curses of the covenant recorded in this Book of Instruction.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² “Then the generations to come, both your own descendants and the foreigners
      who come from distant lands, will see the devastation of the land and the diseases
      the Lord inflicts on it. '
    23: "²³ They will exclaim, ‘The whole land is devastated by sulfur and salt. It\
      \ is a wasteland with nothing planted and nothing growing, not even a blade\
      \ of grass. It is like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,\
      \ which the Lord destroyed in his intense anger.’ \n"
    24: "²⁴ “And all the surrounding nations will ask, ‘Why has the Lord done this\
      \ to this land? Why was he so angry?’ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “And the answer will be, ‘This happened because the people of the land
      abandoned the covenant that the Lord, the God of their ancestors, made with
      them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ Instead, they turned away to serve and worship gods they had not known
      before, gods that were not from the Lord. '
    27: '²⁷ That is why the Lord’s anger has burned against this land, bringing down
      on it every curse recorded in this book. '
    28: "²⁸ In great anger and fury the Lord uprooted his people from their land and\
      \ banished them to another land, where they still live today!’ \n"
    29: ²⁹ “The Lord our God has secrets known to no one. We are not accountable for
      them, but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed
      to us, so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions.
  30:
    1: '¹ “In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have
      listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the Lord
      your God has exiled you, take to heart all these instructions. '
    2: '² If at that time you and your children return to the Lord your God, and if
      you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given
      you today, '
    3: '³ then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes. He will have mercy on
      you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you. '
    4: '⁴ Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth, the Lord your God
      will gather you from there and bring you back again. '
    5: "⁵ The Lord your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors,\
      \ and you will possess that land again. Then he will make you even more prosperous\
      \ and numerous than your ancestors! \n"
    6: '⁶ “The Lord your God will change your heart and the hearts of all your descendants,
      so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live! '
    7: '⁷ The Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those
      who hate and persecute you. '
    8: "⁸ Then you will again obey the Lord and keep all his commands that I am giving\
      \ you today. \n"
    9: '⁹ “The Lord your God will then make you successful in everything you do. He
      will give you many children and numerous livestock, and he will cause your fields
      to produce abundant harvests, for the Lord will again delight in being good
      to you as he was to your ancestors. '
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the\
      \ commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction, and if you turn\
      \ to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, and
      it is not beyond your reach. '
    12: '¹² It is not kept in heaven, so distant that you must ask, ‘Who will go up
      to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey?’ '
    13: '¹³ It is not kept beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, ‘Who will
      cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey?’ '
    14: "¹⁴ No, the message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your\
      \ heart so that you can obey it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death, between
      prosperity and disaster. '
    16: "¹⁶ For I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to keep his commands,\
      \ decrees, and regulations by walking in his ways. If you do this, you will\
      \ live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you and the land you are\
      \ about to enter and occupy. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen, and if you are
      drawn away to serve and worship other gods, '
    18: "¹⁸ then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not\
      \ live a long, good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings
      and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh,
      that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live! '
    20: ²⁰ You can make this choice by loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and
      committing yourself firmly to him. This is the key to your life. And if you
      love and obey the Lord, you will live long in the land the Lord swore to give
      your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
  31:
    1: '¹ When Moses had finished giving these instructions to all the people of Israel, '
    2: '² he said, “I am now 120 years old, and I am no longer able to lead you. The
      Lord has told me, ‘You will not cross the Jordan River.’ '
    3: "³ But the Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy\
      \ the nations living there, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua\
      \ will lead you across the river, just as the Lord promised. \n"
    4: '⁴ “The Lord will destroy the nations living in the land, just as he destroyed
      Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord will hand over to you the people who live there, and you must deal
      with them as I have commanded you. '
    6: "⁶ So be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid and do not panic before them.\
      \ For the Lord your God will personally go ahead of you. He will neither fail\
      \ you nor abandon you.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Moses called for Joshua, and as all Israel watched, he said to him,
      “Be strong and courageous! For you will lead these people into the land that
      the Lord swore to their ancestors he would give them. You are the one who will
      divide it among them as their grants of land. '
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of\
      \ you. He will be with you; he will neither fail you nor abandon you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Moses wrote this entire body of instruction in a book and gave it to
      the priests, who carried the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and to the elders of
      Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses gave them this command: “At the end of every seventh year,
      the Year of Release, during the Festival of Shelters, '
    11: '¹¹ you must read this Book of Instruction to all the people of Israel when
      they assemble before the Lord your God at the place he chooses. '
    12: '¹² Call them all together—men, women, children, and the foreigners living
      in your towns—so they may hear this Book of Instruction and learn to fear the
      Lord your God and carefully obey all the terms of these instructions. '
    13: "¹³ Do this so that your children who have not known these instructions will\
      \ hear them and will learn to fear the Lord your God. Do this as long as you\
      \ live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “The time has come for you to die. Call Joshua
      and present yourselves at the Tabernacle, so that I may commission him there.”
      So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tabernacle. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Lord appeared to them in a pillar of cloud that stood at the entrance\
      \ to the sacred tent. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses, “You are about to die and join your ancestors.
      After you are gone, these people will begin to worship foreign gods, the gods
      of the land where they are going. They will abandon me and break my covenant
      that I have made with them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then my anger will blaze forth against them. I will abandon them, hiding
      my face from them, and they will be devoured. Terrible trouble will come down
      on them, and on that day they will say, ‘These disasters have come down on us
      because God is no longer among us!’ '
    18: "¹⁸ At that time I will hide my face from them on account of all the evil\
      \ they commit by worshiping other gods. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “So write down the words of this song, and teach it to the people of Israel.
      Help them learn it, so it may serve as a witness for me against them. '
    20: '²⁰ For I will bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors—a
      land flowing with milk and honey. There they will become prosperous, eat all
      the food they want, and become fat. But they will begin to worship other gods;
      they will despise me and break my covenant. '
    21: "²¹ And when great disasters come down on them, this song will stand as evidence\
      \ against them, for it will never be forgotten by their descendants. I know\
      \ the intentions of these people, even now before they have entered the land\
      \ I swore to give them.” \n"
    22: "²² So that very day Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it\
      \ to the Israelites. \n"
    23: "²³ Then the Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun with these words: “Be strong\
      \ and courageous, for you must bring the people of Israel into the land I swore\
      \ to give them. I will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ When Moses had finished writing this entire body of instruction in a book, '
    25: '²⁵ he gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of the Lord’s
      Covenant: '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this Book of Instruction and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant
      of the Lord your God, so it may remain there as a witness against the people
      of Israel. '
    27: "²⁷ For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Even now, while I am still\
      \ alive and am here with you, you have rebelled against the Lord. How much more\
      \ rebellious will you be after my death! \n"
    28: '²⁸ “Now summon all the elders and officials of your tribes, so that I can
      speak to them directly and call heaven and earth to witness against them. '
    29: "²⁹ I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and will turn\
      \ from the way I have commanded you to follow. In the days to come, disaster\
      \ will come down on you, for you will do what is evil in the Lord’s sight, making\
      \ him very angry with your actions.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ So Moses recited this entire song publicly to the assembly of Israel:'
  32:
    1: "¹ “Listen, O heavens, and I will speak!\n    Hear, O earth, the words that\
      \ I say!\n"
    2: "² Let my teaching fall on you like rain;\n    let my speech settle like dew.\n\
      Let my words fall like rain on tender grass,\n    like gentle showers on young\
      \ plants.\n"
    3: "³ I will proclaim the name of the Lord;\n    how glorious is our God!\n"
    4: "⁴ He is the Rock; his deeds are perfect.\n    Everything he does is just and\
      \ fair.\nHe is a faithful God who does no wrong;\n    how just and upright he\
      \ is! \n"
    5: "⁵ “But they have acted corruptly toward him;\n    when they act so perversely,\n\
      are they really his children?\n    They are a deceitful and twisted generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is this the way you repay the Lord,\n    you foolish and senseless people?\n\
      Isn’t he your Father who created you?\n    Has he not made you and established\
      \ you?\n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of long ago;\n    think about the generations past.\n\
      Ask your father, and he will inform you.\n    Inquire of your elders, and they\
      \ will tell you.\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High assigned lands to the nations,\n    when he divided up\
      \ the human race,\nhe established the boundaries of the peoples\n    according\
      \ to the number in his heavenly court. \n"
    9: "⁹ “For the people of Israel belong to the Lord;\n    Jacob is his special\
      \ possession.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He found them in a desert land,\n    in an empty, howling wasteland.\n\
      He surrounded them and watched over them;\n    he guarded them as he would guard\
      \ his own eyes.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Like an eagle that rouses her chicks\n    and hovers over her young,\n\
      so he spread his wings to take them up\n    and carried them safely on his pinions.\n"
    12: "¹² The Lord alone guided them;\n    they followed no foreign gods.\n"
    13: "¹³ He let them ride over the highlands\n    and feast on the crops of the\
      \ fields.\nHe nourished them with honey from the rock\n    and olive oil from\
      \ the stony ground.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He fed them yogurt from the herd\n    and milk from the flock,\n    together\
      \ with the fat of lambs.\nHe gave them choice rams from Bashan, and goats,\n\
      \    together with the choicest wheat.\nYou drank the finest wine,\n    made\
      \ from the juice of grapes. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “But Israel soon became fat and unruly;\n    the people grew heavy, plump,\
      \ and stuffed!\nThen they abandoned the God who had made them;\n    they made\
      \ light of the Rock of their salvation.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They stirred up his jealousy by worshiping foreign gods;\n    they provoked\
      \ his fury with detestable deeds.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They offered sacrifices to demons, which are not God,\n    to gods they\
      \ had not known before,\nto new gods only recently arrived,\n    to gods their\
      \ ancestors had never feared.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ You neglected the Rock who had fathered you;\n    you forgot the God who\
      \ had given you birth. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “The Lord saw this and drew back,\n    provoked to anger by his own sons\
      \ and daughters.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He said, ‘I will abandon them;\n    then see what becomes of them.\nFor\
      \ they are a twisted generation,\n    children without integrity.\n"
    21: "²¹ They have roused my jealousy by worshiping things that are not God;\n\
      \    they have provoked my anger with their useless idols.\nNow I will rouse\
      \ their jealousy through people who are not even a people;\n    I will provoke\
      \ their anger through the foolish Gentiles.\n"
    22: "²² For my anger blazes forth like fire\n    and burns to the depths of the\
      \ grave.\nIt devours the earth and all its crops\n    and ignites the foundations\
      \ of the mountains.\n"
    23: "²³ I will heap disasters upon them\n    and shoot them down with my arrows.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I will weaken them with famine,\n    burning fever, and deadly disease.\n\
      I will send the fangs of wild beasts\n    and poisonous snakes that glide in\
      \ the dust.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Outside, the sword will bring death,\n    and inside, terror will strike\n\
      both young men and young women,\n    both infants and the aged.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I would have annihilated them,\n    wiping out even the memory of them.\n"
    27: "²⁷ But I feared the taunt of Israel’s enemy,\n    who might misunderstand\
      \ and say,\n“Our own power has triumphed!\n    The Lord had nothing to do with\
      \ this!”’ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “But Israel is a senseless nation;\n    the people are foolish, without\
      \ understanding.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Oh, that they were wise and could understand this!\n    Oh, that they\
      \ might know their fate!\n"
    30: "³⁰ How could one person chase a thousand of them,\n    and two people put\
      \ ten thousand to flight,\nunless their Rock had sold them,\n    unless the\
      \ Lord had given them up?\n"
    31: "³¹ But the rock of our enemies is not like our Rock,\n    as even they recognize.\n"
    32: "³² Their vine grows from the vine of Sodom,\n    from the vineyards of Gomorrah.\n\
      Their grapes are poison,\n    and their clusters are bitter.\n"
    33: "³³ Their wine is the venom of serpents,\n    the deadly poison of cobras.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ “The Lord says, ‘Am I not storing up these things,\n    sealing them away\
      \ in my treasury?\n"
    35: "³⁵ I will take revenge; I will pay them back.\n    In due time their feet\
      \ will slip.\nTheir day of disaster will arrive,\n    and their destiny will\
      \ overtake them.’ \n"
    36: "³⁶ “Indeed, the Lord will give justice to his people,\n    and he will change\
      \ his mind about his servants,\nwhen he sees their strength is gone\n    and\
      \ no one is left, slave or free.\n"
    37: "³⁷ Then he will ask, ‘Where are their gods,\n    the rocks they fled to for\
      \ refuge?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Where now are those gods,\n    who ate the fat of their sacrifices\n \
      \   and drank the wine of their offerings?\nLet those gods arise and help you!\n\
      \    Let them provide you with shelter!\n"
    39: "³⁹ Look now; I myself am he!\n    There is no other god but me!\nI am the\
      \ one who kills and gives life;\n    I am the one who wounds and heals;\n  \
      \  no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Now I raise my hand to heaven\n    and declare, “As surely as I live,\n"
    41: "⁴¹ when I sharpen my flashing sword\n    and begin to carry out justice,\n\
      I will take revenge on my enemies\n    and repay those who reject me.\n"
    42: "⁴² I will make my arrows drunk with blood,\n    and my sword will devour\
      \ flesh—\nthe blood of the slaughtered and the captives,\n    and the heads\
      \ of the enemy leaders.”’ \n"
    43: "⁴³ “Rejoice with him, you heavens,\n    and let all of God’s angels worship\
      \ him.\nRejoice with his people, you Gentiles,\n    and let all the angels be\
      \ strengthened in him.\nFor he will avenge the blood of his children;\n    he\
      \ will take revenge against his enemies.\nHe will repay those who hate him\n\
      \    and cleanse his people’s land.” \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ So Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this\
      \ song to the people. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ When Moses had finished reciting all these words to the people of Israel, '
    46: '⁴⁶ he added: “Take to heart all the words of warning I have given you today.
      Pass them on as a command to your children so they will obey every word of these
      instructions. '
    47: "⁴⁷ These instructions are not empty words—they are your life! By obeying\
      \ them you will enjoy a long life in the land you will occupy when you cross\
      \ the Jordan River.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ That same day the Lord said to Moses, '
    49: '⁴⁹ “Go to Moab, to the mountains east of the river, and climb Mount Nebo,
      which is across from Jericho. Look out across the land of Canaan, the land I
      am giving to the people of Israel as their own special possession. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Then you will die there on the mountain. You will join your ancestors,
      just as Aaron, your brother, died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors. '
    51: '⁵¹ For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah
      at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You failed to demonstrate my holiness to
      the people of Israel there. '
    52: ⁵² So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land
      I am giving to the people of Israel.”
  33:
    1: "¹ This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the people of Israel\
      \ before his death: \n"
    2: "² “The Lord came from Mount Sinai\n    and dawned upon us from Mount Seir;\n\
      he shone forth from Mount Paran\n    and came from Meribah-kadesh\n    with\
      \ flaming fire at his right hand.\n"
    3: "³ Indeed, he loves his people;\n    all his holy ones are in his hands.\n\
      They follow in his steps\n    and accept his teaching.\n"
    4: "⁴ Moses gave us the Lord’s instruction,\n    the special possession of the\
      \ people of Israel.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord became king in Israel—\n    when the leaders of the people assembled,\n\
      \    when the tribes of Israel gathered as one.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben:\n“Let the tribe of Reuben live\
      \ and not die out,\n    though they are few in number.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Moses said this about the tribe of Judah:\n“O Lord, hear the cry of Judah\n\
      \    and bring them together as a people.\nGive them strength to defend their\
      \ cause;\n    help them against their enemies!” \n"
    8: "⁸ Moses said this about the tribe of Levi:\n“O Lord, you have given your Thummim\
      \ and Urim—the sacred lots—\n    to your faithful servants the Levites.\nYou\
      \ put them to the test at Massah\n    and struggled with them at the waters\
      \ of Meribah.\n"
    9: "⁹ The Levites obeyed your word\n    and guarded your covenant.\nThey were\
      \ more loyal to you\n    than to their own parents.\nThey ignored their relatives\n\
      \    and did not acknowledge their own children.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They teach your regulations to Jacob;\n    they give your instructions\
      \ to Israel.\nThey present incense before you\n    and offer whole burnt offerings\
      \ on the altar.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Bless the ministry of the Levites, O Lord,\n    and accept all the work\
      \ of their hands.\nHit their enemies where it hurts the most;\n    strike down\
      \ their foes so they never rise again.” \n"
    12: "¹² Moses said this about the tribe of Benjamin:\n“The people of Benjamin\
      \ are loved by the Lord\n    and live in safety beside him.\nHe surrounds them\
      \ continuously\n    and preserves them from every harm.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Moses said this about the tribes of Joseph:\n“May their land be blessed\
      \ by the Lord\n    with the precious gift of dew from the heavens\n    and water\
      \ from beneath the earth;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with the rich fruit that grows in the sun,\n    and the rich harvest produced\
      \ each month;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ with the finest crops of the ancient mountains,\n    and the abundance\
      \ from the everlasting hills;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ with the best gifts of the earth and its bounty,\n    and the favor of\
      \ the one who appeared in the burning bush.\nMay these blessings rest on Joseph’s\
      \ head,\n    crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Joseph has the majesty of a young bull;\n    he has the horns of a wild\
      \ ox.\nHe will gore distant nations,\n    even to the ends of the earth.\nThis\
      \ is my blessing for the multitudes of Ephraim\n    and the thousands of Manasseh.”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar:\n“May the people\
      \ of Zebulun prosper in their travels.\n    May the people of Issachar prosper\
      \ at home in their tents.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They summon the people to the mountain\n    to offer proper sacrifices\
      \ there.\nThey benefit from the riches of the sea\n    and the hidden treasures\
      \ in the sand.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Moses said this about the tribe of Gad:\n“Blessed is the one who enlarges\
      \ Gad’s territory!\n    Gad is poised there like a lion\n    to tear off an\
      \ arm or a head.\n"
    21: "²¹ The people of Gad took the best land for themselves;\n    a leader’s share\
      \ was assigned to them.\nWhen the leaders of the people were assembled,\n  \
      \  they carried out the Lord’s justice\n    and obeyed his regulations for Israel.”\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Moses said this about the tribe of Dan:\n“Dan is a lion’s cub,\n    leaping\
      \ out from Bashan.” \n"
    23: "²³ Moses said this about the tribe of Naphtali:\n“O Naphtali, you are rich\
      \ in favor\n    and full of the Lord’s blessings;\n    may you possess the west\
      \ and the south.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ Moses said this about the tribe of Asher:\n“May Asher be blessed above\
      \ other sons;\n    may he be esteemed by his brothers;\n    may he bathe his\
      \ feet in olive oil.\n"
    25: "²⁵ May the bolts of your gates be of iron and bronze;\n    may you be secure\
      \ all your days.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ “There is no one like the God of Israel.\n    He rides across the heavens\
      \ to help you,\n    across the skies in majestic splendor.\n"
    27: "²⁷ The eternal God is your refuge,\n    and his everlasting arms are under\
      \ you.\nHe drives out the enemy before you;\n    he cries out, ‘Destroy them!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ So Israel will live in safety,\n    prosperous Jacob in security,\nin\
      \ a land of grain and new wine,\n    while the heavens drop down dew.\n"
    29: "²⁹ How blessed you are, O Israel!\n    Who else is like you, a people saved\
      \ by the Lord?\nHe is your protecting shield\n    and your triumphant sword!\n\
      Your enemies will cringe before you,\n    and you will stomp on their backs!”"
  34:
    1: '¹ Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah
      Peak, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him the whole land,
      from Gilead as far as Dan; '
    2: '² all the land of Naphtali; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; all the land
      of Judah, extending to the Mediterranean Sea; '
    3: '³ the Negev; the Jordan Valley with Jericho—the city of palms—as far as Zoar. '
    4: "⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham,\
      \ Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have\
      \ now allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you will not enter the land.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, just
      as the Lord had said. '
    6: '⁶ The Lord buried him in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab, but to this day
      no one knows the exact place. '
    7: '⁷ Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was clear, and he
      was as strong as ever. '
    8: "⁸ The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty\
      \ days, until the customary period of mourning was over. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid\
      \ his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him, doing just as the Lord\
      \ had commanded Moses. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord
      knew face to face. '
    11: '¹¹ The Lord sent him to perform all the miraculous signs and wonders in the
      land of Egypt against Pharaoh, and all his servants, and his entire land. '
    12: ¹² With mighty power, Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all
      Israel.
