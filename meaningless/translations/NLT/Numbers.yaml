  1:
    1: '¹ A year after Israel’s departure from Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses in the
      Tabernacle in the wilderness of Sinai. On the first day of the second month
      of that year he said, '
    2: '² “From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors
      by their clans and families. List all the men '
    3: '³ twenty years old or older who are able to go to war. You and Aaron must
      register the troops, '
    4: "⁴ and you will be assisted by one family leader from each tribe. \n"
    5: '⁵ “These are the tribes and the names of the leaders who will assist you:TribeLeaderReuben
      Elizur son of Shedeur '
    6: '⁶ Simeon Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai '
    7: '⁷ Judah Nahshon son of Amminadab '
    8: '⁸ Issachar Nethanel son of Zuar '
    9: '⁹ Zebulun Eliab son of Helon '
    10: '¹⁰ Ephraim son of Joseph Elishama son of AmmihudManasseh son of Joseph Gamaliel
      son of Pedahzur '
    11: '¹¹ Benjamin Abidan son of Gideoni '
    12: '¹² Dan Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai '
    13: '¹³ Asher Pagiel son of Ocran '
    14: '¹⁴ Gad Eliasaph son of Deuel '
    15: "¹⁵ Naphtali Ahira son of Enan \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These are the chosen leaders of the community, the leaders of their ancestral\
      \ tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So Moses and Aaron called together these chosen leaders, '
    18: '¹⁸ and they assembled the whole community of Israel on that very day. All
      the people were registered according to their ancestry by their clans and families.
      The men of Israel who were twenty years old or older were listed one by one, '
    19: "¹⁹ just as the Lord had commanded Moses. So Moses recorded their names in\
      \ the wilderness of Sinai. \n"
    20: '²⁰-²¹ This is the number of men twenty years old or older who were able to
      go to war, as their names were listed in the records of their clans and families:TribeNumberReuben

    30: '⁴⁰-⁴¹ Asher 41,500 '
    31: "⁴²-⁴³ Naphtali 53,400 \n"
    32: '⁴⁴ These were the men registered by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders
      of Israel, all listed according to their ancestral descent. '
    33: '⁴⁵ They were registered by families—all the men of Israel who were twenty
      years old or older and able to go to war. '
    34: "⁴⁶ The total number was 603,550. \n"
    35: '⁴⁷ But this total did not include the Levites. '
    36: '⁴⁸ For the Lord had said to Moses, '
    37: '⁴⁹ “Do not include the tribe of Levi in the registration; do not count them
      with the rest of the Israelites. '
    38: '⁵⁰ Put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with
      all its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the Tabernacle and all its
      furnishings as you travel, and they must take care of it and camp around it. '
    39: '⁵¹ Whenever it is time for the Tabernacle to move, the Levites will take
      it down. And when it is time to stop, they will set it up again. But any unauthorized
      person who goes too near the Tabernacle must be put to death. '
    40: '⁵² Each tribe of Israel will camp in a designated area with its own family
      banner. '
    41: "⁵³ But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant to protect\
      \ the community of Israel from the Lord’s anger. The Levites are responsible\
      \ to stand guard around the Tabernacle.” \n"
    42: ⁵⁴ So the Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
  2:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord gave these instructions to Moses and Aaron: '
    2: "² “When the Israelites set up camp, each tribe will be assigned its own area.\
      \ The tribal divisions will camp beneath their family banners on all four sides\
      \ of the Tabernacle, but at some distance from it. \n"
    3: '³-⁴ “The divisions of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun are to camp toward the
      sunrise on the east side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These
      are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered
      troops:TribeLeaderNumberJudah Nahshon son of Amminadab74,600  '
    4: '⁵-⁶ IssacharNethanel son of Zuar 54,400 '
    5: "⁷-⁸ Zebulun Eliab son of Helon57,400  \n"
    6: "⁹ So the total of all the troops on Judah’s side of the camp is 186,400. These\
      \ three tribes are to lead the way whenever the Israelites travel to a new campsite.\
      \ \n"
    7: '¹⁰-¹¹ “The divisions of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad are to camp on the south side
      of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the
      tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops:TribeLeaderNumberReubenElizur

    8: '¹²-¹³ Simeon Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai59,300  '
    9: "¹⁴-¹⁵ GadEliasaph son of Deuel 45,650 \n"
    10: "¹⁶ So the total of all the troops on Reuben’s side of the camp is 151,450.\
      \ These three tribes will be second in line whenever the Israelites travel.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹⁷ “Then the Tabernacle, carried by the Levites, will set out from the middle\
      \ of the camp. All the tribes are to travel in the same order that they camp,\
      \ each in position under the appropriate family banner. \n"
    12: '¹⁸-¹⁹ “The divisions of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin are to camp on the
      west side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names
      of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops:TribeLeaderNumberEphraim
      Elishama son of Ammihud40,500  '
    13: '²⁰-²¹ ManassehGamaliel son of Pedahzur 32,200 '
    14: "²²-²³ Benjamin Abidan son of Gideoni35,400  \n"
    15: "²⁴ So the total of all the troops on Ephraim’s side of the camp is 108,100.\
      \ These three tribes will be third in line whenever the Israelites travel. \n"
    16: '²⁵-²⁶ “The divisions of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali are to camp on the north
      side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of
      the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops:TribeLeaderNumberDanAhiezer
      son of Ammishaddai 62,700 '
    17: '²⁷-²⁸ Asher Pagiel son of Ocran41,500  '
    18: "²⁹-³⁰ NaphtaliAhira son of Enan 53,400 \n"
    19: "³¹ So the total of all the troops on Dan’s side of the camp is 157,600. These\
      \ three tribes will be last, marching under their banners whenever the Israelites\
      \ travel.” \n"
    20: '³² In summary, the troops of Israel listed by their families totaled 603,550. '
    21: '³³ But as the Lord had commanded, the Levites were not included in this registration. '
    22: ³⁴ So the people of Israel did everything as the Lord had commanded Moses.
      Each clan and family set up camp and marched under their banners exactly as
      the Lord had instructed them.
  3:
    1: '¹ This is the family line of Aaron and Moses as it was recorded when the Lord
      spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai: '
    2: '² The names of Aaron’s sons were Nadab (the oldest), Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    3: '³ These sons of Aaron were anointed and ordained to minister as priests. '
    4: "⁴ But Nadab and Abihu died in the Lord’s presence in the wilderness of Sinai\
      \ when they burned before the Lord the wrong kind of fire, different than he\
      \ had commanded. Since they had no sons, this left only Eleazar and Ithamar\
      \ to serve as priests with their father, Aaron. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    6: '⁶ “Call forward the tribe of Levi, and present them to Aaron the priest to
      serve as his assistants. '
    7: '⁷ They will serve Aaron and the whole community, performing their sacred duties
      in and around the Tabernacle. '
    8: '⁸ They will also maintain all the furnishings of the sacred tent, serving
      in the Tabernacle on behalf of all the Israelites. '
    9: '⁹ Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They have been given from among
      all the people of Israel to serve as their assistants. '
    10: "¹⁰ Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood.\
      \ But any unauthorized person who goes too near the sanctuary must be put to\
      \ death.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    12: '¹² “Look, I have chosen the Levites from among the Israelites to serve as
      substitutes for all the firstborn sons of the people of Israel. The Levites
      belong to me, '
    13: "¹³ for all the firstborn males are mine. On the day I struck down all the\
      \ firstborn sons of the Egyptians, I set apart for myself all the firstborn\
      \ in Israel, both of people and of animals. They are mine; I am the Lord.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord spoke again to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai. He said, '
    15: '¹⁵ “Record the names of the members of the tribe of Levi by their families
      and clans. List every male who is one month old or older.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So Moses listed them, just as the Lord had commanded. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Levi had three sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The clans descended from Gershon were named after two of his descendants,\
      \ Libni and Shimei. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The clans descended from Kohath were named after four of his descendants,\
      \ Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The clans descended from Merari were named after two of his descendants,\
      \ Mahli and Mushi.\nThese were the Levite clans, listed according to their family\
      \ groups. \n"
    21: '²¹ The descendants of Gershon were composed of the clans descended from Libni
      and Shimei. '
    22: '²² There were 7,500 males one month old or older among these Gershonite clans. '
    23: '²³ They were assigned the area to the west of the Tabernacle for their camp. '
    24: '²⁴ The leader of the Gershonite clans was Eliasaph son of Lael. '
    25: '²⁵ These two clans were responsible to care for the Tabernacle, including
      the sacred tent with its layers of coverings, the curtain at its entrance, '
    26: "²⁶ the curtains of the courtyard that surrounded the Tabernacle and altar,\
      \ the curtain at the courtyard entrance, the ropes, and all the equipment related\
      \ to their use. \n"
    27: '²⁷ The descendants of Kohath were composed of the clans descended from Amram,
      Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. '
    28: '²⁸ There were 8,600 males one month old or older among these Kohathite clans.
      They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary, '
    29: '²⁹ and they were assigned the area south of the Tabernacle for their camp. '
    30: '³⁰ The leader of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. '
    31: '³¹ These four clans were responsible for the care of the Ark, the table,
      the lampstand, the altars, the various articles used in the sanctuary, the inner
      curtain, and all the equipment related to their use. '
    32: "³² Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, was the chief administrator over all\
      \ the Levites, with special responsibility for the oversight of the sanctuary.\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ The descendants of Merari were composed of the clans descended from Mahli
      and Mushi. '
    34: '³⁴ There were 6,200 males one month old or older among these Merarite clans. '
    35: '³⁵ They were assigned the area north of the Tabernacle for their camp. The
      leader of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail. '
    36: '³⁶ These two clans were responsible for the care of the frames supporting
      the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the pillars, the bases, and all the equipment
      related to their use. '
    37: "³⁷ They were also responsible for the posts of the courtyard and all their\
      \ bases, pegs, and ropes. \n"
    38: "³⁸ The area in front of the Tabernacle, in the east toward the sunrise, was\
      \ reserved for the tents of Moses and of Aaron and his sons, who had the final\
      \ responsibility for the sanctuary on behalf of the people of Israel. Anyone\
      \ other than a priest or Levite who went too near the sanctuary was to be put\
      \ to death. \n"
    39: "³⁹ When Moses and Aaron counted the Levite clans at the Lord’s command, the\
      \ total number was 22,000 males one month old or older. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now count all the firstborn sons in Israel
      who are one month old or older, and make a list of their names. '
    41: "⁴¹ The Levites must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn sons\
      \ of Israel; I am the Lord. And the Levites’ livestock must be reserved for\
      \ me as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the whole nation of Israel.”\
      \ \n"
    42: '⁴² So Moses counted the firstborn sons of the people of Israel, just as the
      Lord had commanded. '
    43: "⁴³ The number of firstborn sons who were one month old or older was 22,273.\
      \ \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    45: '⁴⁵ “Take the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons of the people
      of Israel. And take the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn
      livestock of the people of Israel. The Levites belong to me; I am the Lord. '
    46: '⁴⁶ There are 273 more firstborn sons of Israel than there are Levites. To
      redeem these extra firstborn sons, '
    47: '⁴⁷ collect five pieces of silver for each of them (each piece weighing the
      same as the sanctuary shekel, which equals twenty gerahs). '
    48: "⁴⁸ Give the silver to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the\
      \ extra firstborn sons.” \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ So Moses collected the silver for redeeming the firstborn sons of Israel
      who exceeded the number of Levites. '
    50: '⁵⁰ He collected 1,365 pieces of silver on behalf of these firstborn sons
      of Israel (each piece weighing the same as the sanctuary shekel). '
    51: ⁵¹ And Moses gave the silver for the redemption to Aaron and his sons, just
      as the Lord had commanded.
  4:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: '² “Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Kohathite
      division of the tribe of Levi. '
    3: "³ List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to\
      \ serve in the Tabernacle. \n"
    4: '⁴ “The duties of the Kohathites at the Tabernacle will relate to the most
      sacred objects. '
    5: '⁵ When the camp moves, Aaron and his sons must enter the Tabernacle first
      to take down the inner curtain and cover the Ark of the Covenant with it. '
    6: "⁶ Then they must cover the inner curtain with fine goatskin leather and spread\
      \ over that a single piece of blue cloth. Finally, they must put the carrying\
      \ poles of the Ark in place. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Next they must spread a blue cloth over the table where the Bread of the
      Presence is displayed, and on the cloth they will place the bowls, ladles, jars,
      pitchers, and the special bread. '
    8: "⁸ They must spread a scarlet cloth over all of this, and finally a covering\
      \ of fine goatskin leather on top of the scarlet cloth. Then they must insert\
      \ the carrying poles into the table. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Next they must cover the lampstand with a blue cloth, along with its lamps,
      lamp snuffers, trays, and special jars of olive oil. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then they must cover the lampstand and its accessories with fine goatskin\
      \ leather and place the bundle on a carrying frame. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Next they must spread a blue cloth over the gold incense altar and cover
      this cloth with fine goatskin leather. Then they must attach the carrying poles
      to the altar. '
    12: "¹² They must take all the remaining furnishings of the sanctuary and wrap\
      \ them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine goatskin leather, and place them\
      \ on the carrying frame. \n"
    13: '¹³ “They must remove the ashes from the altar for sacrifices and cover the
      altar with a purple cloth. '
    14: '¹⁴ All the altar utensils—the firepans, meat forks, shovels, basins, and
      all the containers—must be placed on the cloth, and a covering of fine goatskin
      leather must be spread over them. Finally, they must put the carrying poles
      in place. '
    15: "¹⁵ The camp will be ready to move when Aaron and his sons have finished covering\
      \ the sanctuary and all the sacred articles. The Kohathites will come and carry\
      \ these things to the next destination. But they must not touch the sacred objects,\
      \ or they will die. So these are the things from the Tabernacle that the Kohathites\
      \ must carry. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Eleazar son of Aaron the priest will be responsible for the oil of the\
      \ lampstand, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing\
      \ oil. In fact, Eleazar will be responsible for the entire Tabernacle and everything\
      \ in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Do not let the Kohathite clans be destroyed from among the Levites! '
    19: '¹⁹ This is what you must do so they will live and not die when they approach
      the most sacred objects. Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and
      assign a specific duty or load to each person. '
    20: "²⁰ The Kohathites must never enter the sanctuary to look at the sacred objects\
      \ for even a moment, or they will die.” \n"
    21: '²¹ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    22: '²² “Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Gershonite
      division of the tribe of Levi. '
    23: "²³ List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible\
      \ to serve in the Tabernacle. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “These Gershonite clans will be responsible for general service and carrying
      loads. '
    25: '²⁵ They must carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle itself
      with its coverings, the outer covering of fine goatskin leather, and the curtain
      for the Tabernacle entrance. '
    26: '²⁶ They are also to carry the curtains for the courtyard walls that surround
      the Tabernacle and altar, the curtain across the courtyard entrance, the ropes,
      and all the equipment related to their use. The Gershonites are responsible
      for all these items. '
    27: '²⁷ Aaron and his sons will direct the Gershonites regarding all their duties,
      whether it involves moving the equipment or doing other work. They must assign
      the Gershonites responsibility for the loads they are to carry. '
    28: "²⁸ So these are the duties assigned to the Gershonite clans at the Tabernacle.\
      \ They will be directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Now record the names of the members of the clans and families of the
      Merarite division of the tribe of Levi. '
    30: "³⁰ List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible\
      \ to serve in the Tabernacle. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Their only duty at the Tabernacle will be to carry loads. They will carry
      the frames of the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the posts, and the bases; '
    32: '³² also the posts for the courtyard walls with their bases, pegs, and ropes;
      and all the accessories and everything else related to their use. Assign the
      various loads to each man by name. '
    33: "³³ So these are the duties of the Merarite clans at the Tabernacle. They\
      \ are directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ So Moses, Aaron, and the other leaders of the community listed the members
      of the Kohathite division by their clans and families. '
    35: '³⁵ The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who
      were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, '
    36: '³⁶ and the total number came to 2,750. '
    37: "³⁷ So this was the total of all those from the Kohathite clans who were eligible\
      \ to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the Lord\
      \ had commanded through Moses. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The Gershonite division was also listed by its clans and families. '
    39: '³⁹ The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who
      were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, '
    40: '⁴⁰ and the total number came to 2,630. '
    41: "⁴¹ So this was the total of all those from the Gershonite clans who were\
      \ eligible to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as\
      \ the Lord had commanded. \n"
    42: '⁴² The Merarite division was also listed by its clans and families. '
    43: '⁴³ The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who
      were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, '
    44: '⁴⁴ and the total number came to 3,200. '
    45: "⁴⁵ So this was the total of all those from the Merarite clans who were eligible\
      \ for service. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the Lord had commanded through\
      \ Moses. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel listed all the Levites by their
      clans and families. '
    47: '⁴⁷ All the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for
      service in the Tabernacle and for its transportation '
    48: '⁴⁸ numbered 8,580. '
    49: "⁴⁹ When their names were recorded, as the Lord had commanded through Moses,\
      \ each man was assigned his task and told what to carry.\nAnd so the registration\
      \ was completed, just as the Lord had commanded Moses."
  5:
    1: '¹ The Lord gave these instructions to Moses: '
    2: '² “Command the people of Israel to remove from the camp anyone who has a skin
      disease or a discharge, or who has become ceremonially unclean by touching a
      dead person. '
    3: '³ This command applies to men and women alike. Remove them so they will not
      defile the camp in which I live among them.” '
    4: "⁴ So the Israelites did as the Lord had commanded Moses and removed such people\
      \ from the camp. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    6: '⁶ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If any of the
      people—men or women—betray the Lord by doing wrong to another person, they are
      guilty. '
    7: '⁷ They must confess their sin and make full restitution for what they have
      done, adding an additional 20 percent and returning it to the person who was
      wronged. '
    8: '⁸ But if the person who was wronged is dead, and there are no near relatives
      to whom restitution can be made, the payment belongs to the Lord and must be
      given to the priest. Those who are guilty must also bring a ram as a sacrifice,
      and they will be purified and made right with the Lord. '
    9: '⁹ All the sacred offerings that the Israelites bring to a priest will belong
      to him. '
    10: "¹⁰ Each priest may keep all the sacred donations that he receives.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    12: "¹² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“Suppose a\
      \ man’s wife goes astray, and she is unfaithful to her husband "
    13: '¹³ and has sex with another man, but neither her husband nor anyone else
      knows about it. She has defiled herself, even though there was no witness and
      she was not caught in the act. '
    14: '¹⁴ If her husband becomes jealous and is suspicious of his wife and needs
      to know whether or not she has defiled herself, '
    15: "¹⁵ the husband must bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring an offering\
      \ of two quarts of barley flour to be presented on her behalf. Do not mix it\
      \ with olive oil or frankincense, for it is a jealousy offering—an offering\
      \ to prove whether or not she is guilty. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “The priest will then present her to stand trial before the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ He must take some holy water in a clay jar and pour into it dust he has
      taken from the Tabernacle floor. '
    18: '¹⁸ When the priest has presented the woman before the Lord, he must unbind
      her hair and place in her hands the offering of proof—the jealousy offering
      to determine whether her husband’s suspicions are justified. The priest will
      stand before her, holding the jar of bitter water that brings a curse to those
      who are guilty. '
    19: '¹⁹ The priest will then put the woman under oath and say to her, ‘If no other
      man has had sex with you, and you have not gone astray and defiled yourself
      while under your husband’s authority, may you be immune from the effects of
      this bitter water that brings on the curse. '
    20: "²⁰ But if you have gone astray by being unfaithful to your husband, and have\
      \ defiled yourself by having sex with another man—’ \n"
    21: '²¹ “At this point the priest must put the woman under oath by saying, ‘May
      the people know that the Lord’s curse is upon you when he makes you infertile,
      causing your womb to shrivel and your abdomen to swell. '
    22: '²² Now may this water that brings the curse enter your body and cause your
      abdomen to swell and your womb to shrivel.’ And the woman will be required to
      say, ‘Yes, let it be so.’ '
    23: '²³ And the priest will write these curses on a piece of leather and wash
      them off into the bitter water. '
    24: "²⁴ He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings on the curse.\
      \ When the water enters her body, it will cause bitter suffering if she is guilty.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “The priest will take the jealousy offering from the woman’s hand, lift
      it up before the Lord, and carry it to the altar. '
    26: '²⁶ He will take a handful of the flour as a token portion and burn it on
      the altar, and he will require the woman to drink the water. '
    27: '²⁷ If she has defiled herself by being unfaithful to her husband, the water
      that brings on the curse will cause bitter suffering. Her abdomen will swell
      and her womb will shrink, and her name will become a curse among her people. '
    28: "²⁸ But if she has not defiled herself and is pure, then she will be unharmed\
      \ and will still be able to have children. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “This is the ritual law for dealing with suspicion. If a woman goes astray
      and defiles herself while under her husband’s authority, '
    30: '³⁰ or if a man becomes jealous and is suspicious that his wife has been unfaithful,
      the husband must present his wife before the Lord, and the priest will apply
      this entire ritual law to her. '
    31: ³¹ The husband will be innocent of any guilt in this matter, but his wife
      will be held accountable for her sin.”
  6:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“If any of the\
      \ people, either men or women, take the special vow of a Nazirite, setting themselves\
      \ apart to the Lord in a special way, "
    3: '³ they must give up wine and other alcoholic drinks. They must not use vinegar
      made from wine or from other alcoholic drinks, they must not drink fresh grape
      juice, and they must not eat grapes or raisins. '
    4: "⁴ As long as they are bound by their Nazirite vow, they are not allowed to\
      \ eat or drink anything that comes from a grapevine—not even the grape seeds\
      \ or skins. \n"
    5: '⁵ “They must never cut their hair throughout the time of their vow, for they
      are holy and set apart to the Lord. Until the time of their vow has been fulfilled,
      they must let their hair grow long. '
    6: '⁶ And they must not go near a dead body during the entire period of their
      vow to the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ Even if the dead person is their own father, mother, brother, or sister,
      they must not defile themselves, for the hair on their head is the symbol of
      their separation to God. '
    8: "⁸ This requirement applies as long as they are set apart to the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “If someone falls dead beside them, the hair they have dedicated will be
      defiled. They must wait for seven days and then shave their heads. Then they
      will be cleansed from their defilement. '
    10: '¹⁰ On the eighth day they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons
      to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    11: '¹¹ The priest will offer one of the birds for a sin offering and the other
      for a burnt offering. In this way, he will purify them from the guilt they incurred
      through contact with the dead body. Then they must reaffirm their commitment
      and let their hair begin to grow again. '
    12: "¹² The days of their vow that were completed before their defilement no longer\
      \ count. They must rededicate themselves to the Lord as a Nazirite for the full\
      \ term of their vow, and each must bring a one-year-old male lamb for a guilt\
      \ offering. \n"
    13: '¹³ “This is the ritual law for Nazirites. At the conclusion of their time
      of separation as Nazirites, they must each go to the entrance of the Tabernacle '
    14: '¹⁴ and offer their sacrifices to the Lord: a one-year-old male lamb without
      defect for a burnt offering, a one-year-old female lamb without defect for a
      sin offering, a ram without defect for a peace offering, '
    15: '¹⁵ a basket of bread made without yeast—cakes of choice flour mixed with
      olive oil and wafers spread with olive oil—along with their prescribed grain
      offerings and liquid offerings. '
    16: '¹⁶ The priest will present these offerings before the Lord: first the sin
      offering and the burnt offering; '
    17: "¹⁷ then the ram for a peace offering, along with the basket of bread made\
      \ without yeast. The priest must also present the prescribed grain offering\
      \ and liquid offering to the Lord. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then the Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
      They will take the hair that had been dedicated and place it on the fire beneath
      the peace-offering sacrifice. '
    19: '¹⁹ After the Nazirite’s head has been shaved, the priest will take for each
      of them the boiled shoulder of the ram, and he will take from the basket a cake
      and a wafer made without yeast. He will put them all into the Nazirite’s hands. '
    20: "²⁰ Then the priest will lift them up as a special offering before the Lord.\
      \ These are holy portions for the priest, along with the breast of the special\
      \ offering and the thigh of the sacred offering that are lifted up before the\
      \ Lord. After this ceremony the Nazirites may again drink wine. \n"
    21: "²¹ “This is the ritual law of the Nazirites, who vow to bring these offerings\
      \ to the Lord. They may also bring additional offerings if they can afford it.\
      \ And they must be careful to do whatever they vowed when they set themselves\
      \ apart as Nazirites.” \n"
    22: '²² Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    23: "²³ “Tell Aaron and his sons to bless the people of Israel with this special\
      \ blessing: \n"
    24: "²⁴ ‘May the Lord bless you\n    and protect you.\n"
    25: "²⁵ May the Lord smile on you\n    and be gracious to you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ May the Lord show you his favor\n    and give you his peace.’ \n"
    27: ²⁷ Whenever Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel in my name, I myself
      will bless them.”
  7:
    1: '¹ On the day Moses set up the Tabernacle, he anointed it and set it apart
      as holy. He also anointed and set apart all its furnishings and the altar with
      its utensils. '
    2: '² Then the leaders of Israel—the tribal leaders who had registered the troops—came
      and brought their offerings. '
    3: "³ Together they brought six large wagons and twelve oxen. There was a wagon\
      \ for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. They presented these to the\
      \ Lord in front of the Tabernacle. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    5: '⁵ “Receive their gifts, and use these oxen and wagons for transporting the
      Tabernacle. Distribute them among the Levites according to the work they have
      to do.” '
    6: '⁶ So Moses took the wagons and oxen and presented them to the Levites. '
    7: '⁷ He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonite division for their work, '
    8: '⁸ and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarite division for their
      work. All their work was done under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron the
      priest. '
    9: "⁹ But he gave none of the wagons or oxen to the Kohathite division, since\
      \ they were required to carry the sacred objects of the Tabernacle on their\
      \ shoulders. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The leaders also presented dedication gifts for the altar at the time
      it was anointed. They each placed their gifts before the altar. '
    11: "¹¹ The Lord said to Moses, “Let one leader bring his gift each day for the\
      \ dedication of the altar.” \n"
    12: "¹² On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab, leader of the tribe of Judah,\

    13: '¹³ Then have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and raise

    16: '¹⁶ “Of all the people of Israel, the Levites are reserved for me. I have
      claimed them for myself in place of all the firstborn sons of the Israelites;
      I have taken the Levites as their substitutes. '
    17: '¹⁷ For all the firstborn males among the people of Israel are mine, both
      of people and of animals. I set them apart for myself on the day I struck down
      all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians. '
    18: '¹⁸ Yes, I have claimed the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons of
      Israel. '
    19: "¹⁹ And of all the Israelites, I have assigned the Levites to Aaron and his\
      \ sons. They will serve in the Tabernacle on behalf of the Israelites and make\
      \ sacrifices to purify the people so no plague will strike them when they approach\
      \ the sanctuary.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ So Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel dedicated the Levites,
      carefully following all the Lord’s instructions to Moses. '
    21: '²¹ The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and
      Aaron lifted them up and presented them to the Lord as a special offering. He
      then offered a sacrifice to purify them and make them right with the Lord. '
    22: "²² After that the Levites went into the Tabernacle to perform their duties,\
      \ assisting Aaron and his sons. So they carried out all the commands that the\
      \ Lord gave Moses concerning the Levites. \n"
    23: '²³ The Lord also instructed Moses, '
    24: '²⁴ “This is the rule the Levites must follow: They must begin serving in
      the Tabernacle at the age of twenty-five, '
    25: '²⁵ and they must retire at the age of fifty. '
    26: ²⁶ After retirement they may assist their fellow Levites by serving as guards
      at the Tabernacle, but they may not officiate in the service. This is how you
      must assign duties to the Levites.”
  9:
    1: '¹ A year after Israel’s departure from Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses in the
      wilderness of Sinai. In the first month of that year he said, '
    2: '² “Tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time, '
    3: "³ at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. Be sure to follow\
      \ all my decrees and regulations concerning this celebration.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Moses told the people to celebrate the Passover '
    5: '⁵ in the wilderness of Sinai as twilight fell on the fourteenth day of the
      month. And they celebrated the festival there, just as the Lord had commanded
      Moses. '
    6: '⁶ But some of the men had been ceremonially defiled by touching a dead body,
      so they could not celebrate the Passover that day. They came to Moses and Aaron
      that day '
    7: "⁷ and said, “We have become ceremonially unclean by touching a dead body.\
      \ But why should we be prevented from presenting the Lord’s offering at the\
      \ proper time with the rest of the Israelites?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Moses answered, “Wait here until I have received instructions for you from\
      \ the Lord.” \n"
    9: '⁹ This was the Lord’s reply to Moses. '
    10: '¹⁰ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If any of the
      people now or in future generations are ceremonially unclean at Passover time
      because of touching a dead body, or if they are on a journey and cannot be present
      at the ceremony, they may still celebrate the Lord’s Passover. '
    11: '¹¹ They must offer the Passover sacrifice one month later, at twilight on
      the fourteenth day of the second month. They must eat the Passover lamb at that
      time with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast. '
    12: "¹² They must not leave any of the lamb until the next morning, and they must\
      \ not break any of its bones. They must follow all the normal regulations concerning\
      \ the Passover. \n"
    13: '¹³ “But those who neglect to celebrate the Passover at the regular time,
      even though they are ceremonially clean and not away on a trip, will be cut
      off from the community of Israel. If they fail to present the Lord’s offering
      at the proper time, they will suffer the consequences of their guilt. '
    14: "¹⁴ And if foreigners living among you want to celebrate the Passover to the\
      \ Lord, they must follow these same decrees and regulations. The same laws apply\
      \ both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ On the day the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it. But from evening
      until morning the cloud over the Tabernacle looked like a pillar of fire. '
    16: '¹⁶ This was the regular pattern—at night the cloud that covered the Tabernacle
      had the appearance of fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ Whenever the cloud lifted from over the sacred tent, the people of Israel
      would break camp and follow it. And wherever the cloud settled, the people of
      Israel would set up camp. '
    18: '¹⁸ In this way, they traveled and camped at the Lord’s command wherever he
      told them to go. Then they remained in their camp as long as the cloud stayed
      over the Tabernacle. '
    19: '¹⁹ If the cloud remained over the Tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites
      stayed and performed their duty to the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Sometimes the cloud would stay over the Tabernacle for only a few days,
      so the people would stay for only a few days, as the Lord commanded. Then at
      the Lord’s command they would break camp and move on. '
    21: '²¹ Sometimes the cloud stayed only overnight and lifted the next morning.
      But day or night, when the cloud lifted, the people broke camp and moved on. '
    22: '²² Whether the cloud stayed above the Tabernacle for two days, a month, or
      a year, the people of Israel stayed in camp and did not move on. But as soon
      as it lifted, they broke camp and moved on. '
    23: ²³ So they camped or traveled at the Lord’s command, and they did whatever
      the Lord told them through Moses.
  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Make two trumpets of hammered silver for calling the community to assemble
      and for signaling the breaking of camp. '
    3: '³ When both trumpets are blown, everyone must gather before you at the entrance
      of the Tabernacle. '
    4: "⁴ But if only one trumpet is blown, then only the leaders—the heads of the\
      \ clans of Israel—must present themselves to you. \n"
    5: '⁵ “When you sound the signal to move on, the tribes camped on the east side
      of the Tabernacle must break camp and move forward. '
    6: '⁶ When you sound the signal a second time, the tribes camped on the south
      will follow. You must sound short blasts as the signal for moving on. '
    7: '⁷ But when you call the people to an assembly, blow the trumpets with a different
      signal. '
    8: "⁸ Only the priests, Aaron’s descendants, are allowed to blow the trumpets.\
      \ This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ “When you arrive in your own land and go to war against your enemies who
      attack you, sound the alarm with the trumpets. Then the Lord your God will remember
      you and rescue you from your enemies. '
    10: "¹⁰ Blow the trumpets in times of gladness, too, sounding them at your annual\
      \ festivals and at the beginning of each month. And blow the trumpets over your\
      \ burnt offerings and peace offerings. The trumpets will remind your God of\
      \ his covenant with you. I am the Lord your God.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ In the second year after Israel’s departure from Egypt—on the twentieth
      day of the second month—the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle of the Covenant. '
    12: "¹² So the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai and traveled on\
      \ from place to place until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran. \n"
    13: '¹³ When the people set out for the first time, following the instructions
      the Lord had given through Moses, '
    14: '¹⁴ Judah’s troops led the way. They marched behind their banner, and their
      leader was Nahshon son of Amminadab. '
    15: '¹⁵ They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Issachar, led by Nethanel
      son of Zuar, '
    16: "¹⁶ and the troops of the tribe of Zebulun, led by Eliab son of Helon. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonite and Merarite divisions
      of the Levites were next in the line of march, carrying the Tabernacle with
      them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Reuben’s troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader
      was Elizur son of Shedeur. '
    19: '¹⁹ They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Simeon, led by Shelumiel
      son of Zurishaddai, '
    20: "²⁰ and the troops of the tribe of Gad, led by Eliasaph son of Deuel. \n"
    21: '²¹ Next came the Kohathite division of the Levites, carrying the sacred objects
      from the Tabernacle. Before they arrived at the next camp, the Tabernacle would
      already be set up at its new location. '
    22: '²² Ephraim’s troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader
      was Elishama son of Ammihud. '
    23: '²³ They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Manasseh, led by Gamaliel
      son of Pedahzur, '
    24: "²⁴ and the troops of the tribe of Benjamin, led by Abidan son of Gideoni.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Dan’s troops went last, marching behind their banner and serving as the
      rear guard for all the tribal camps. Their leader was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. '
    26: '²⁶ They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Asher, led by Pagiel son
      of Ocran, '
    27: "²⁷ and the troops of the tribe of Naphtali, led by Ahira son of Enan. \n"
    28: "²⁸ This was the order in which the Israelites marched, division by division.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ One day Moses said to his brother-in-law, Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite,\
      \ “We are on our way to the place the Lord promised us, for he said, ‘I will\
      \ give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the Lord has\
      \ promised wonderful blessings for Israel!” \n"
    30: "³⁰ But Hobab replied, “No, I will not go. I must return to my own land and\
      \ family.” \n"
    31: '³¹ “Please don’t leave us,” Moses pleaded. “You know the places in the wilderness
      where we should camp. Come, be our guide. '
    32: "³² If you do, we’ll share with you all the blessings the Lord gives us.”\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the Lord, with
      the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant moving ahead of them to show them where to stop
      and rest. '
    34: '³⁴ As they moved on each day, the cloud of the Lord hovered over them. '
    35: '³⁵ And whenever the Ark set out, Moses would shout, “Arise, O Lord, and let
      your enemies be scattered! Let them flee before you!” '
    36: ³⁶ And when the Ark was set down, he would say, “Return, O Lord, to the countless
      thousands of Israel!”
  11:
    1: '¹ Soon the people began to complain about their hardship, and the Lord heard
      everything they said. Then the Lord’s anger blazed against them, and he sent
      a fire to rage among them, and he destroyed some of the people in the outskirts
      of the camp. '
    2: '² Then the people screamed to Moses for help, and when he prayed to the Lord,
      the fire stopped. '
    3: "³ After that, the area was known as Taberah (which means “the place of burning”),\
      \ because fire from the Lord had burned among them there. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the foreign rabble who were traveling with the Israelites began to
      crave the good things of Egypt. And the people of Israel also began to complain.
      “Oh, for some meat!” they exclaimed. '
    5: '⁵ “We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt. And we had all the
      cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic we wanted. '
    6: "⁶ But now our appetites are gone. All we ever see is this manna!” \n"
    7: '⁷ The manna looked like small coriander seeds, and it was pale yellow like
      gum resin. '
    8: '⁸ The people would go out and gather it from the ground. They made flour by
      grinding it with hand mills or pounding it in mortars. Then they boiled it in
      a pot and made it into flat cakes. These cakes tasted like pastries baked with
      olive oil. '
    9: "⁹ The manna came down on the camp with the dew during the night. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moses heard all the families standing in the doorways of their tents whining,
      and the Lord became extremely angry. Moses was also very aggravated. '
    11: '¹¹ And Moses said to the Lord, “Why are you treating me, your servant, so
      harshly? Have mercy on me! What did I do to deserve the burden of all these
      people? '
    12: '¹² Did I give birth to them? Did I bring them into the world? Why did you
      tell me to carry them in my arms like a mother carries a nursing baby? How can
      I carry them to the land you swore to give their ancestors? '
    13: '¹³ Where am I supposed to get meat for all these people? They keep whining
      to me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ '
    14: '¹⁴ I can’t carry all these people by myself! The load is far too heavy! '
    15: "¹⁵ If this is how you intend to treat me, just go ahead and kill me. Do me\
      \ a favor and spare me this misery!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Gather before me seventy men who are recognized
      as elders and leaders of Israel. Bring them to the Tabernacle to stand there
      with you. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will come down and talk to you there. I will take some of the Spirit\
      \ that is upon you, and I will put the Spirit upon them also. They will bear\
      \ the burden of the people along with you, so you will not have to carry it\
      \ alone. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “And say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves, for tomorrow you will have
      meat to eat. You were whining, and the Lord heard you when you cried, “Oh, for
      some meat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the Lord will give you meat, and
      you will have to eat it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it won’t be for just a day or two, or for five or ten or even twenty. '
    20: "²⁰ You will eat it for a whole month until you gag and are sick of it. For\
      \ you have rejected the Lord, who is here among you, and you have whined to\
      \ him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’” \n"
    21: '²¹ But Moses responded to the Lord, “There are 600,000 foot soldiers here
      with me, and yet you say, ‘I will give them meat for a whole month!’ '
    22: "²² Even if we butchered all our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them?\
      \ Even if we caught all the fish in the sea, would that be enough?” \n"
    23: "²³ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Has my arm lost its power? Now you will\
      \ see whether or not my word comes true!” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So Moses went out and reported the Lord’s words to the people. He gathered
      the seventy elders and stationed them around the Tabernacle. '
    25: "²⁵ And the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses. Then he gave the\
      \ seventy elders the same Spirit that was upon Moses. And when the Spirit rested\
      \ upon them, they prophesied. But this never happened again. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Two men, Eldad and Medad, had stayed behind in the camp. They were listed
      among the elders, but they had not gone out to the Tabernacle. Yet the Spirit
      rested upon them as well, so they prophesied there in the camp. '
    27: "²⁷ A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying\
      \ in the camp!” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ assistant since his youth, protested,\
      \ “Moses, my master, make them stop!” \n"
    29: '²⁹ But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord’s
      people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them all!” '
    30: "³⁰ Then Moses returned to the camp with the elders of Israel. \n"
    31: '³¹ Now the Lord sent a wind that brought quail from the sea and let them
      fall all around the camp. For miles in every direction there were quail flying
      about three feet above the ground. '
    32: '³² So the people went out and caught quail all that day and throughout the
      night and all the next day, too. No one gathered less than fifty bushels! They
      spread the quail all around the camp to dry. '
    33: '³³ But while they were gorging themselves on the meat—while it was still
      in their mouths—the anger of the Lord blazed against the people, and he struck
      them with a severe plague. '
    34: '³⁴ So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah (which means “graves of gluttony”)
      because there they buried the people who had craved meat from Egypt. '
    35: ³⁵ From Kibroth-hattaavah the Israelites traveled to Hazeroth, where they
      stayed for some time.
  12:
    1: '¹ While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he
      had married a Cushite woman. '
    2: '² They said, “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Hasn’t he spoken through
      us, too?” But the Lord heard them. '
    3: "³ (Now Moses was very humble—more humble than any other person on earth.)\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ So immediately the Lord called to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam and said, “Go
      out to the Tabernacle, all three of you!” So the three of them went to the Tabernacle. '
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord descended in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance
      of the Tabernacle. “Aaron and Miriam!” he called, and they stepped forward. '
    6: "⁶ And the Lord said to them, “Now listen to what I say:\n“If there were prophets\
      \ among you,\n    I, the Lord, would reveal myself in visions.\n    I would\
      \ speak to them in dreams.\n"
    7: "⁷ But not with my servant Moses.\n    Of all my house, he is the one I trust.\n"
    8: "⁸ I speak to him face to face,\n    clearly, and not in riddles!\n    He sees\
      \ the Lord as he is.\nSo why were you not afraid\n    to criticize my servant\
      \ Moses?” \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord was very angry with them, and he departed. '
    10: '¹⁰ As the cloud moved from above the Tabernacle, there stood Miriam, her
      skin as white as snow from leprosy. When Aaron saw what had happened to her, '
    11: '¹¹ he cried out to Moses, “Oh, my master! Please don’t punish us for this
      sin we have so foolishly committed. '
    12: "¹² Don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, already decayed at birth.” \n"
    13: "¹³ So Moses cried out to the Lord, “O God, I beg you, please heal her!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But the Lord said to Moses, “If her father had done nothing more than\
      \ spit in her face, wouldn’t she be defiled for seven days? So keep her outside\
      \ the camp for seven days, and after that she may be accepted back.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days, and the people waited
      until she was brought back before they traveled again. '
    16: ¹⁶ Then they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
  13:
    1: '¹ The Lord now said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Send out men to explore the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the
      Israelites. Send one leader from each of the twelve ancestral tribes.” '
    3: '³ So Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He sent out twelve men, all tribal
      leaders of Israel, from their camp in the wilderness of Paran. '
    4: '⁴ These were the tribes and the names of their leaders:TribeLeaderReuben Shammua
      son of Zaccur '
    5: '⁵ Simeon Shaphat son of Hori '
    6: '⁶ Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh '
    7: '⁷ Issachar Igal son of Joseph '
    8: '⁸ Ephraim Hoshea son of Nun '
    9: '⁹ Benjamin Palti son of Raphu '
    10: '¹⁰ Zebulun Gaddiel son of Sodi '
    11: '¹¹ Manasseh son of Joseph Gaddi son of Susi '
    12: '¹² Dan Ammiel son of Gemalli '
    13: '¹³ Asher Sethur son of Michael '
    14: '¹⁴ Naphtali Nahbi son of Vophsi '
    15: "¹⁵ Gad Geuel son of Maki \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These are the names of the men Moses sent out to explore the land. (Moses\
      \ called Hoshea son of Nun by the name Joshua.) \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Moses gave the men these instructions as he sent them out to explore the
      land: “Go north through the Negev into the hill country. '
    18: '¹⁸ See what the land is like, and find out whether the people living there
      are strong or weak, few or many. '
    19: '¹⁹ See what kind of land they live in. Is it good or bad? Do their towns
      have walls, or are they unprotected like open camps? '
    20: "²⁰ Is the soil fertile or poor? Are there many trees? Do your best to bring\
      \ back samples of the crops you see.” (It happened to be the season for harvesting\
      \ the first ripe grapes.) \n"
    21: '²¹ So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far
      as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. '
    22: '²² Going north, they passed through the Negev and arrived at Hebron, where
      Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai—all descendants of Anak—lived. (The ancient town
      of Hebron was founded seven years before the Egyptian city of Zoan.) '
    23: '²³ When they came to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a
      single cluster of grapes so large that it took two of them to carry it on a
      pole between them! They also brought back samples of the pomegranates and figs. '
    24: "²⁴ That place was called the valley of Eshcol (which means “cluster”), because\
      \ of the cluster of grapes the Israelite men cut there. \n"
    25: '²⁵ After exploring the land for forty days, the men returned '
    26: '²⁶ to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the wilderness
      of Paran. They reported to the whole community what they had seen and showed
      them the fruit they had taken from the land. '
    27: '²⁷ This was their report to Moses: “We entered the land you sent us to explore,
      and it is indeed a bountiful country—a land flowing with milk and honey. Here
      is the kind of fruit it produces. '
    28: '²⁸ But the people living there are powerful, and their towns are large and
      fortified. We even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak! '
    29: "²⁹ The Amalekites live in the Negev, and the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites\
      \ live in the hill country. The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean\
      \ Sea and along the Jordan Valley.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ But Caleb tried to quiet the people as they stood before Moses. “Let’s\
      \ go at once to take the land,” he said. “We can certainly conquer it!” \n"
    31: '³¹ But the other men who had explored the land with him disagreed. “We can’t
      go up against them! They are stronger than we are!” '
    32: '³² So they spread this bad report about the land among the Israelites: “The
      land we traveled through and explored will devour anyone who goes to live there.
      All the people we saw were huge. '
    33: ³³ We even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak. Next to them we felt
      like grasshoppers, and that’s what they thought, too!”
  14:
    1: '¹ Then the whole community began weeping aloud, and they cried all night. '
    2: '² Their voices rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron.
      “If only we had died in Egypt, or even here in the wilderness!” they complained. '
    3: '³ “Why is the Lord taking us to this country only to have us die in battle?
      Our wives and our little ones will be carried off as plunder! Wouldn’t it be
      better for us to return to Egypt?” '
    4: "⁴ Then they plotted among themselves, “Let’s choose a new leader and go back\
      \ to Egypt!” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground before the whole community
      of Israel. '
    6: '⁶ Two of the men who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son
      of Jephunneh, tore their clothing. '
    7: '⁷ They said to all the people of Israel, “The land we traveled through and
      explored is a wonderful land! '
    8: '⁸ And if the Lord is pleased with us, he will bring us safely into that land
      and give it to us. It is a rich land flowing with milk and honey. '
    9: "⁹ Do not rebel against the Lord, and don’t be afraid of the people of the\
      \ land. They are only helpless prey to us! They have no protection, but the\
      \ Lord is with us! Don’t be afraid of them!” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But the whole community began to talk about stoning Joshua and Caleb.
      Then the glorious presence of the Lord appeared to all the Israelites at the
      Tabernacle. '
    11: '¹¹ And the Lord said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with
      contempt? Will they never believe me, even after all the miraculous signs I
      have done among them? '
    12: "¹² I will disown them and destroy them with a plague. Then I will make you\
      \ into a nation greater and mightier than they are!” \n"
    13: '¹³ But Moses objected. “What will the Egyptians think when they hear about
      it?” he asked the Lord. “They know full well the power you displayed in rescuing
      your people from Egypt. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now if you destroy them, the Egyptians will send a report to the inhabitants
      of this land, who have already heard that you live among your people. They know,
      Lord, that you have appeared to your people face to face and that your pillar
      of cloud hovers over them. They know that you go before them in the pillar of
      cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now if you slaughter all these people with a single blow, the nations
      that have heard of your fame will say, '
    16: "¹⁶ ‘The Lord was not able to bring them into the land he swore to give them,\
      \ so he killed them in the wilderness.’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Please, Lord, prove that your power is as great as you have claimed.
      For you said, '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘The Lord is slow to anger and filled with unfailing love, forgiving every
      kind of sin and rebellion. But he does not excuse the guilty. He lays the sins
      of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even children
      in the third and fourth generations.’ '
    19: "¹⁹ In keeping with your magnificent, unfailing love, please pardon the sins\
      \ of this people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the Lord said, “I will pardon them as you have requested. '
    21: '²¹ But as surely as I live, and as surely as the earth is filled with the
      Lord’s glory, '
    22: '²² not one of these people will ever enter that land. They have all seen
      my glorious presence and the miraculous signs I performed both in Egypt and
      in the wilderness, but again and again they have tested me by refusing to listen
      to my voice. '
    23: '²³ They will never even see the land I swore to give their ancestors. None
      of those who have treated me with contempt will ever see it. '
    24: '²⁴ But my servant Caleb has a different attitude than the others have. He
      has remained loyal to me, so I will bring him into the land he explored. His
      descendants will possess their full share of that land. '
    25: "²⁵ Now turn around, and don’t go on toward the land where the Amalekites\
      \ and Canaanites live. Tomorrow you must set out for the wilderness in the direction\
      \ of the Red Sea.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    27: '²⁷ “How long must I put up with this wicked community and its complaints
      about me? Yes, I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making against
      me. '
    28: '²⁸ Now tell them this: ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do
      to you the very things I heard you say. '
    29: '²⁹ You will all drop dead in this wilderness! Because you complained against
      me, every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the
      registration will die. '
    30: "³⁰ You will not enter and occupy the land I swore to give you. The only exceptions\
      \ will be Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. \n"
    31: '³¹ “‘You said your children would be carried off as plunder. Well, I will
      bring them safely into the land, and they will enjoy what you have despised. '
    32: '³² But as for you, you will drop dead in this wilderness. '
    33: "³³ And your children will be like shepherds, wandering in the wilderness\
      \ for forty years. In this way, they will pay for your faithlessness, until\
      \ the last of you lies dead in the wilderness. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “‘Because your men explored the land for forty days, you must wander in
      the wilderness for forty years—a year for each day, suffering the consequences
      of your sins. Then you will discover what it is like to have me for an enemy.’ '
    35: "³⁵ I, the Lord, have spoken! I will certainly do these things to every member\
      \ of the community who has conspired against me. They will be destroyed here\
      \ in this wilderness, and here they will die!” \n"
    36: '³⁶ The ten men Moses had sent to explore the land—the ones who incited rebellion
      against the Lord with their bad report— '
    37: '³⁷ were struck dead with a plague before the Lord. '
    38: "³⁸ Of the twelve who had explored the land, only Joshua and Caleb remained\
      \ alive. \n"
    39: '³⁹ When Moses reported the Lord’s words to all the Israelites, the people
      were filled with grief. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Then they got up early the next morning and went to the top of the range\
      \ of hills. “Let’s go,” they said. “We realize that we have sinned, but now\
      \ we are ready to enter the land the Lord has promised us.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ But Moses said, “Why are you now disobeying the Lord’s orders to return
      to the wilderness? It won’t work. '
    42: '⁴² Do not go up into the land now. You will only be crushed by your enemies
      because the Lord is not with you. '
    43: "⁴³ When you face the Amalekites and Canaanites in battle, you will be slaughtered.\
      \ The Lord will abandon you because you have abandoned the Lord.” \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ But the people defiantly pushed ahead toward the hill country, even though
      neither Moses nor the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant left the camp. '
    45: ⁴⁵ Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in those hills came down
      and attacked them and chased them back as far as Hormah.
  15:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord told Moses, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“When you finally\
      \ settle in the land I am giving you, "
    3: '³ you will offer special gifts as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. These gifts
      may take the form of a burnt offering, a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, a voluntary
      offering, or an offering at any of your annual festivals, and they may be taken
      from your herds of cattle or your flocks of sheep and goats. '
    4: '⁴ When you present these offerings, you must also give the Lord a grain offering
      of two quarts of choice flour mixed with one quart of olive oil. '
    5: "⁵ For each lamb offered as a burnt offering or a special sacrifice, you must\
      \ also present one quart of wine as a liquid offering. \n"
    6: '⁶ “If the sacrifice is a ram, give a grain offering of four quarts of choice
      flour mixed with a third of a gallon of olive oil, '
    7: "⁷ and give a third of a gallon of wine as a liquid offering. This will be\
      \ a pleasing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    8: '⁸ “When you present a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice to
      fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the Lord, '
    9: '⁹ you must also give a grain offering of six quarts of choice flour mixed
      with two quarts of olive oil, '
    10: "¹⁰ and give two quarts of wine as a liquid offering. This will be a special\
      \ gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Each sacrifice of a bull, ram, lamb, or young goat should be prepared
      in this way. '
    12: '¹² Follow these instructions with each offering you present. '
    13: '¹³ All of you native-born Israelites must follow these instructions when
      you offer a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ And if any foreigners visit you or live among you and want to present
      a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, they must follow these same
      procedures. '
    15: '¹⁵ Native-born Israelites and foreigners are equal before the Lord and are
      subject to the same decrees. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed
      from generation to generation. '
    16: "¹⁶ The same instructions and regulations will apply both to you and to the\
      \ foreigners living among you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“When you arrive\
      \ in the land where I am taking you, "
    19: '¹⁹ and you eat the crops that grow there, you must set some aside as a sacred
      offering to the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Present a cake from the first of the flour you grind, and set it aside
      as a sacred offering, as you do with the first grain from the threshing floor. '
    21: "²¹ Throughout the generations to come, you are to present a sacred offering\
      \ to the Lord each year from the first of your ground flour. \n"
    22: '²² “But suppose you unintentionally fail to carry out all these commands
      that the Lord has given you through Moses. '
    23: '²³ And suppose your descendants in the future fail to do everything the Lord
      has commanded through Moses. '
    24: '²⁴ If the mistake was made unintentionally, and the community was unaware
      of it, the whole community must present a young bull for a burnt offering as
      a pleasing aroma to the Lord. It must be offered along with its prescribed grain
      offering and liquid offering and with one male goat for a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ With it the priest will purify the whole community of Israel, making them
      right with the Lord, and they will be forgiven. For it was an unintentional
      sin, and they have corrected it with their offerings to the Lord—the special
      gift and the sin offering. '
    26: "²⁶ The whole community of Israel will be forgiven, including the foreigners\
      \ living among you, for all the people were involved in the sin. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “If one individual commits an unintentional sin, the guilty person must
      bring a one-year-old female goat for a sin offering. '
    28: '²⁸ The priest will sacrifice it to purify the guilty person before the Lord,
      and that person will be forgiven. '
    29: "²⁹ These same instructions apply both to native-born Israelites and to the\
      \ foreigners living among you. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “But those who brazenly violate the Lord’s will, whether native-born Israelites
      or foreigners, have blasphemed the Lord, and they must be cut off from the community. '
    31: "³¹ Since they have treated the Lord’s word with contempt and deliberately\
      \ disobeyed his command, they must be completely cut off and suffer the punishment\
      \ for their guilt.” \n"
    32: '³² One day while the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they discovered
      a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. '
    33: '³³ The people who found him doing this took him before Moses, Aaron, and
      the rest of the community. '
    34: '³⁴ They held him in custody because they did not know what to do with him. '
    35: '³⁵ Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must be put to death! The whole
      community must stone him outside the camp.” '
    36: "³⁶ So the whole community took the man outside the camp and stoned him to\
      \ death, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    38: '³⁸ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: Throughout the
      generations to come you must make tassels for the hems of your clothing and
      attach them with a blue cord. '
    39: '³⁹ When you see the tassels, you will remember and obey all the commands
      of the Lord instead of following your own desires and defiling yourselves, as
      you are prone to do. '
    40: '⁴⁰ The tassels will help you remember that you must obey all my commands
      and be holy to your God. '
    41: ⁴¹ I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt that I
      might be your God. I am the Lord your God!”
  16:
    1: '¹ One day Korah son of Izhar, a descendant of Kohath son of Levi, conspired
      with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, from the tribe
      of Reuben. '
    2: '² They incited a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 other leaders of
      the community, all prominent members of the assembly. '
    3: "³ They united against Moses and Aaron and said, “You have gone too far! The\
      \ whole community of Israel has been set apart by the Lord, and he is with all\
      \ of us. What right do you have to act as though you are greater than the rest\
      \ of the Lord’s people?” \n"
    4: '⁴ When Moses heard what they were saying, he fell face down on the ground. '
    5: '⁵ Then he said to Korah and his followers, “Tomorrow morning the Lord will
      show us who belongs to him and who is holy. The Lord will allow only those whom
      he selects to enter his own presence. '
    6: '⁶ Korah, you and all your followers must prepare your incense burners. '
    7: "⁷ Light fires in them tomorrow, and burn incense before the Lord. Then we\
      \ will see whom the Lord chooses as his holy one. You Levites are the ones who\
      \ have gone too far!” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Moses spoke again to Korah: “Now listen, you Levites! '
    9: '⁹ Does it seem insignificant to you that the God of Israel has chosen you
      from among all the community of Israel to be near him so you can serve in the
      Lord’s Tabernacle and stand before the people to minister to them? '
    10: '¹⁰ Korah, he has already given this special ministry to you and your fellow
      Levites. Are you now demanding the priesthood as well? '
    11: "¹¹ The Lord is the one you and your followers are really revolting against!\
      \ For who is Aaron that you are complaining about him?” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they replied,
      “We refuse to come before you! '
    13: '¹³ Isn’t it enough that you brought us out of Egypt, a land flowing with
      milk and honey, to kill us here in this wilderness, and that you now treat us
      like your subjects? '
    14: "¹⁴ What’s more, you haven’t brought us into another land flowing with milk\
      \ and honey. You haven’t given us a new homeland with fields and vineyards.\
      \ Are you trying to fool these men? We will not come.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, “Do not accept their
      grain offerings! I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, and I have
      never hurt a single one of them.” '
    16: '¹⁶ And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers must come here tomorrow
      and present yourselves before the Lord. Aaron will also be here. '
    17: "¹⁷ You and each of your 250 followers must prepare an incense burner and\
      \ put incense on it, so you can all present them before the Lord. Aaron will\
      \ also bring his incense burner.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ So each of these men prepared an incense burner, lit the fire, and placed
      incense on it. Then they all stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle with Moses
      and Aaron. '
    19: '¹⁹ Meanwhile, Korah had stirred up the entire community against Moses and
      Aaron, and they all gathered at the Tabernacle entrance. Then the glorious presence
      of the Lord appeared to the whole community, '
    20: '²⁰ and the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    21: "²¹ “Get away from all these people so that I may instantly destroy them!”\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground. “O God,” they pleaded,\
      \ “you are the God who gives breath to all creatures. Must you be angry with\
      \ all the people when only one man sins?” \n"
    23: '²³ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    24: "²⁴ “Then tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan,\
      \ and Abiram.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ So Moses got up and rushed over to the tents of Dathan and Abiram, followed
      by the elders of Israel. '
    26: '²⁶ “Quick!” he told the people. “Get away from the tents of these wicked
      men, and don’t touch anything that belongs to them. If you do, you will be destroyed
      for their sins.” '
    27: "²⁷ So all the people stood back from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\
      \ Then Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrances of their tents,\
      \ together with their wives and children and little ones. \n"
    28: '²⁸ And Moses said, “This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me to
      do all these things that I have done—for I have not done them on my own. '
    29: '²⁹ If these men die a natural death, or if nothing unusual happens, then
      the Lord has not sent me. '
    30: "³⁰ But if the Lord does something entirely new and the ground opens its mouth\
      \ and swallows them and all their belongings, and they go down alive into the\
      \ grave, then you will know that these men have shown contempt for the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split
      open beneath them. '
    32: '³² The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the men, along with their households
      and all their followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned. '
    33: '³³ So they went down alive into the grave, along with all their belongings.
      The earth closed over them, and they all vanished from among the people of Israel. '
    34: '³⁴ All the people around them fled when they heard their screams. “The earth
      will swallow us, too!” they cried. '
    35: "³⁵ Then fire blazed forth from the Lord and burned up the 250 men who were\
      \ offering incense. \n"
    36: '³⁶ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    37: '³⁷ “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pull all the incense burners
      from the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the burning coals. '
    38: "³⁸ Take the incense burners of these men who have sinned at the cost of their\
      \ lives, and hammer the metal into a thin sheet to overlay the altar. Since\
      \ these burners were used in the Lord’s presence, they have become holy. Let\
      \ them serve as a warning to the people of Israel.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 bronze incense burners that had
      been used by the men who died in the fire, and the bronze was hammered into
      a thin sheet to overlay the altar. '
    40: "⁴⁰ This would warn the Israelites that no unauthorized person—no one who\
      \ was not a descendant of Aaron—should ever enter the Lord’s presence to burn\
      \ incense. If anyone did, the same thing would happen to him as happened to\
      \ Korah and his followers. So the Lord’s instructions to Moses were carried\
      \ out. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ But the very next morning the whole community of Israel began muttering
      again against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the Lord’s people!” '
    42: "⁴² As the community gathered to protest against Moses and Aaron, they turned\
      \ toward the Tabernacle and saw that the cloud had covered it, and the glorious\
      \ presence of the Lord appeared. \n"
    43: '⁴³ Moses and Aaron came and stood in front of the Tabernacle, '
    44: '⁴⁴ and the Lord said to Moses, '
    45: "⁴⁵ “Get away from all these people so that I can instantly destroy them!”\
      \ But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ And Moses said to Aaron, “Quick, take an incense burner and place burning\
      \ coals on it from the altar. Lay incense on it, and carry it out among the\
      \ people to purify them and make them right with the Lord. The Lord’s anger\
      \ is blazing against them—the plague has already begun.” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Aaron did as Moses told him and ran out among the people. The plague had
      already begun to strike down the people, but Aaron burned the incense and purified
      the people. '
    48: '⁴⁸ He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague stopped. '
    49: '⁴⁹ But 14,700 people died in that plague, in addition to those who had died
      in the affair involving Korah. '
    50: ⁵⁰ Then because the plague had stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance
      of the Tabernacle.
  17:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Tell the people of Israel to bring you twelve wooden staffs, one from each
      leader of Israel’s ancestral tribes, and inscribe each leader’s name on his
      staff. '
    3: '³ Inscribe Aaron’s name on the staff of the tribe of Levi, for there must
      be one staff for the leader of each ancestral tribe. '
    4: '⁴ Place these staffs in the Tabernacle in front of the Ark containing the
      tablets of the Covenant, where I meet with you. '
    5: "⁵ Buds will sprout on the staff belonging to the man I choose. Then I will\
      \ finally put an end to the people’s murmuring and complaining against you.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ So Moses gave the instructions to the people of Israel, and each of the
      twelve tribal leaders, including Aaron, brought Moses a staff. '
    7: '⁷ Moses placed the staffs in the Lord’s presence in the Tabernacle of the
      Covenant. '
    8: "⁸ When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day, he found\
      \ that Aaron’s staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, budded,\
      \ blossomed, and produced ripe almonds! \n"
    9: '⁹ When Moses brought all the staffs out from the Lord’s presence, he showed
      them to the people. Each man claimed his own staff. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the Lord said to Moses: “Place Aaron’s staff permanently before the
      Ark of the Covenant to serve as a warning to rebels. This should put an end
      to their complaints against me and prevent any further deaths.” '
    11: "¹¹ So Moses did as the Lord commanded him. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the people of Israel said to Moses, “Look, we are doomed! We are
      dead! We are ruined! '
    13: ¹³ Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle of the Lord dies. Are we
      all doomed to die?”
  18:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said to Aaron: “You, your sons, and your relatives from the\
      \ tribe of Levi will be held responsible for any offenses related to the sanctuary.\
      \ But you and your sons alone will be held responsible for violations connected\
      \ with the priesthood. \n"
    2: '² “Bring your relatives of the tribe of Levi—your ancestral tribe—to assist
      you and your sons as you perform the sacred duties in front of the Tabernacle
      of the Covenant. '
    3: '³ But as the Levites go about all their assigned duties at the Tabernacle,
      they must be careful not to go near any of the sacred objects or the altar.
      If they do, both you and they will die. '
    4: "⁴ The Levites must join you in fulfilling their responsibilities for the care\
      \ and maintenance of the Tabernacle, but no unauthorized person may assist you.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “You yourselves must perform the sacred duties inside the sanctuary and
      at the altar. If you follow these instructions, the Lord’s anger will never
      again blaze against the people of Israel. '
    6: '⁶ I myself have chosen your fellow Levites from among the Israelites to be
      your special assistants. They are a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord for service
      in the Tabernacle. '
    7: "⁷ But you and your sons, the priests, must personally handle all the priestly\
      \ rituals associated with the altar and with everything behind the inner curtain.\
      \ I am giving you the priesthood as your special privilege of service. Any unauthorized\
      \ person who comes too near the sanctuary will be put to death.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord gave these further instructions to Aaron: “I myself have put you
      in charge of all the holy offerings that are brought to me by the people of
      Israel. I have given all these consecrated offerings to you and your sons as
      your permanent share. '
    9: '⁹ You are allotted the portion of the most holy offerings that is not burned
      on the fire. This portion of all the most holy offerings—including the grain
      offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings—will be most holy, and it belongs
      to you and your sons. '
    10: "¹⁰ You must eat it as a most holy offering. All the males may eat of it,\
      \ and you must treat it as most holy. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “All the sacred offerings and special offerings presented to me when the\
      \ Israelites lift them up before the altar also belong to you. I have given\
      \ them to you and to your sons and daughters as your permanent share. Any member\
      \ of your family who is ceremonially clean may eat of these offerings. \n"
    12: '¹² “I also give you the harvest gifts brought by the people as offerings
      to the Lord—the best of the olive oil, new wine, and grain. '
    13: "¹³ All the first crops of their land that the people present to the Lord\
      \ belong to you. Any member of your family who is ceremonially clean may eat\
      \ this food. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Everything in Israel that is specially set apart for the Lord also belongs\
      \ to you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “The firstborn of every mother, whether human or animal, that is offered
      to the Lord will be yours. But you must always redeem your firstborn sons and
      the firstborn of ceremonially unclean animals. '
    16: "¹⁶ Redeem them when they are one month old. The redemption price is five\
      \ pieces of silver (as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel, which\
      \ equals twenty gerahs). \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “However, you may not redeem the firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats.
      They are holy and have been set apart for the Lord. Sprinkle their blood on
      the altar, and burn their fat as a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ The meat of these animals will be yours, just like the breast and right
      thigh that are presented by lifting them up as a special offering before the
      altar. '
    19: "¹⁹ Yes, I am giving you all these holy offerings that the people of Israel\
      \ bring to the Lord. They are for you and your sons and daughters, to be eaten\
      \ as your permanent share. This is an eternal and unbreakable covenant between\
      \ the Lord and you, and it also applies to your descendants.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ And the Lord said to Aaron, “You priests will receive no allotment of
      land or share of property among the people of Israel. I am your share and your
      allotment. '
    21: "²¹ As for the tribe of Levi, your relatives, I will compensate them for their\
      \ service in the Tabernacle. Instead of an allotment of land, I will give them\
      \ the tithes from the entire land of Israel. \n"
    22: '²² “From now on, no Israelites except priests or Levites may approach the
      Tabernacle. If they come too near, they will be judged guilty and will die. '
    23: '²³ Only the Levites may serve at the Tabernacle, and they will be held responsible
      for any offenses against it. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed
      from generation to generation. The Levites will receive no allotment of land
      among the Israelites, '
    24: "²⁴ because I have given them the Israelites’ tithes, which have been presented\
      \ as sacred offerings to the Lord. This will be the Levites’ share. That is\
      \ why I said they would receive no allotment of land among the Israelites.”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ The Lord also told Moses, '
    26: '²⁶ “Give these instructions to the Levites: When you receive from the people
      of Israel the tithes I have assigned as your allotment, give a tenth of the
      tithes you receive—a tithe of the tithe—to the Lord as a sacred offering. '
    27: '²⁷ The Lord will consider this offering to be your harvest offering, as though
      it were the first grain from your own threshing floor or wine from your own
      winepress. '
    28: '²⁸ You must present one-tenth of the tithe received from the Israelites as
      a sacred offering to the Lord. This is the Lord’s sacred portion, and you must
      present it to Aaron the priest. '
    29: "²⁹ Be sure to give to the Lord the best portions of the gifts given to you.\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Also, give these instructions to the Levites: When you present the best
      part as your offering, it will be considered as though it came from your own
      threshing floor or winepress. '
    31: '³¹ You Levites and your families may eat this food anywhere you wish, for
      it is your compensation for serving in the Tabernacle. '
    32: ³² You will not be considered guilty for accepting the Lord’s tithes if you
      give the best portion to the priests. But be careful not to treat the holy gifts
      of the people of Israel as though they were common. If you do, you will die.”
  19:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: '² “Here is another legal requirement commanded by the Lord: Tell the people
      of Israel to bring you a red heifer, a perfect animal that has no defects and
      has never been yoked to a plow. '
    3: '³ Give it to Eleazar the priest, and it will be taken outside the camp and
      slaughtered in his presence. '
    4: '⁴ Eleazar will take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven
      times toward the front of the Tabernacle. '
    5: '⁵ As Eleazar watches, the heifer must be burned—its hide, meat, blood, and
      dung. '
    6: "⁶ Eleazar the priest must then take a stick of cedar, a hyssop branch, and\
      \ some scarlet yarn and throw them into the fire where the heifer is burning.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. Afterward
      he may return to the camp, though he will remain ceremonially unclean until
      evening. '
    8: '⁸ The man who burns the animal must also wash his clothes and bathe himself
      in water, and he, too, will remain unclean until evening. '
    9: '⁹ Then someone who is ceremonially clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer
      and deposit them in a purified place outside the camp. They will be kept there
      for the community of Israel to use in the water for the purification ceremony.
      This ceremony is performed for the removal of sin. '
    10: "¹⁰ The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes,\
      \ and he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent\
      \ law for the people of Israel and any foreigners who live among them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “All those who touch a dead human body will be ceremonially unclean for
      seven days. '
    12: '¹² They must purify themselves on the third and seventh days with the water
      of purification; then they will be purified. But if they do not do this on the
      third and seventh days, they will continue to be unclean even after the seventh
      day. '
    13: "¹³ All those who touch a dead body and do not purify themselves in the proper\
      \ way defile the Lord’s Tabernacle, and they will be cut off from the community\
      \ of Israel. Since the water of purification was not sprinkled on them, their\
      \ defilement continues. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “This is the ritual law that applies when someone dies inside a tent:
      All those who enter that tent and those who were inside when the death occurred
      will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. '
    15: '¹⁵ Any open container in the tent that was not covered with a lid is also
      defiled. '
    16: "¹⁶ And if someone in an open field touches the corpse of someone who was\
      \ killed with a sword or who died a natural death, or if someone touches a human\
      \ bone or a grave, that person will be defiled for seven days. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “To remove the defilement, put some of the ashes from the burnt purification
      offering in a jar, and pour fresh water over them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then someone who is ceremonially clean must take a hyssop branch and dip
      it into the water. That person must sprinkle the water on the tent, on all the
      furnishings in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent; also on the
      person who touched a human bone, or touched someone who was killed or who died
      naturally, or touched a grave. '
    19: "¹⁹ On the third and seventh days the person who is ceremonially clean must\
      \ sprinkle the water on those who are defiled. Then on the seventh day the people\
      \ being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe themselves, and that evening\
      \ they will be cleansed of their defilement. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “But those who become defiled and do not purify themselves will be cut
      off from the community, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. Since
      the water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, they remain defiled. '
    21: '²¹ This is a permanent law for the people. Those who sprinkle the water of
      purification must afterward wash their clothes, and anyone who then touches
      the water used for purification will remain defiled until evening. '
    22: ²² Anything and anyone that a defiled person touches will be ceremonially
      unclean until evening.”
  20:
    1: "¹ In the first month of the year, the whole community of Israel arrived in\
      \ the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. While they were there, Miriam\
      \ died and was buried. \n"
    2: '² There was no water for the people to drink at that place, so they rebelled
      against Moses and Aaron. '
    3: '³ The people blamed Moses and said, “If only we had died in the Lord’s presence
      with our brothers! '
    4: '⁴ Why have you brought the congregation of the Lord’s people into this wilderness
      to die, along with all our livestock? '
    5: "⁵ Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place?\
      \ This land has no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates, and no water\
      \ to drink!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of
      the Tabernacle, where they fell face down on the ground. Then the glorious presence
      of the Lord appeared to them, '
    7: '⁷ and the Lord said to Moses, '
    8: "⁸ “You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community. As\
      \ the people watch, speak to the rock over there, and it will pour out its water.\
      \ You will provide enough water from the rock to satisfy the whole community\
      \ and their livestock.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Moses did as he was told. He took the staff from the place where it was
      kept before the Lord. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock.
      “Listen, you rebels!” he shouted. “Must we bring you water from this rock?” '
    11: "¹¹ Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff, and\
      \ water gushed out. So the entire community and their livestock drank their\
      \ fill. \n"
    12: '¹² But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust me enough
      to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel, you will not lead them into
      the land I am giving them!” '
    13: "¹³ This place was known as the waters of Meribah (which means “arguing”)\
      \ because there the people of Israel argued with the Lord, and there he demonstrated\
      \ his holiness among them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ While Moses was at Kadesh, he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom with\
      \ this message:\n“This is what your relatives, the people of Israel, say: You\
      \ know all the hardships we have been through. "
    15: '¹⁵ Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there a long time, and
      we and our ancestors were brutally mistreated by the Egyptians. '
    16: '¹⁶ But when we cried out to the Lord, he heard us and sent an angel who brought
      us out of Egypt. Now we are camped at Kadesh, a town on the border of your land. '
    17: "¹⁷ Please let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through\
      \ your fields and vineyards. We won’t even drink water from your wells. We will\
      \ stay on the king’s road and never leave it until we have passed through your\
      \ territory.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the king of Edom said, “Stay out of my land, or I will meet you with\
      \ an army!” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Israelites answered, “We will stay on the main road. If our livestock\
      \ drink your water, we will pay for it. Just let us pass through your country.\
      \ That’s all we ask.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ But the king of Edom replied, “Stay out! You may not pass through our
      land.” With that he mobilized his army and marched out against them with an
      imposing force. '
    21: "²¹ Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country, Israel\
      \ was forced to turn around. \n"
    22: '²² The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor. '
    23: '²³ There, on the border of the land of Edom, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    24: '²⁴ “The time has come for Aaron to join his ancestors in death. He will not
      enter the land I am giving the people of Israel, because the two of you rebelled
      against my instructions concerning the water at Meribah. '
    25: '²⁵ Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor. '
    26: "²⁶ There you will remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on Eleazar,\
      \ his son. Aaron will die there and join his ancestors.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ So Moses did as the Lord commanded. The three of them went up Mount Hor
      together as the whole community watched. '
    28: '²⁸ At the summit, Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put
      them on Eleazar, Aaron’s son. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain,
      and Moses and Eleazar went back down. '
    29: ²⁹ When the people realized that Aaron had died, all Israel mourned for him
      thirty days.
  21:
    1: '¹ The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites
      were approaching on the road through Atharim. So he attacked the Israelites
      and took some of them as prisoners. '
    2: '² Then the people of Israel made this vow to the Lord: “If you will hand these
      people over to us, we will completely destroy all their towns.” '
    3: "³ The Lord heard the Israelites’ request and gave them victory over the Canaanites.\
      \ The Israelites completely destroyed them and their towns, and the place has\
      \ been called Hormah ever since. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the
      Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the
      long journey, '
    5: "⁵ and they began to speak against God and Moses. “Why have you brought us\
      \ out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness?” they complained. “There is nothing\
      \ to eat here and nothing to drink. And we hate this horrible manna!” \n"
    6: '⁶ So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many were bitten
      and died. '
    7: "⁷ Then the people came to Moses and cried out, “We have sinned by speaking\
      \ against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take away the snakes.”\
      \ So Moses prayed for the people. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord told him, “Make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach
      it to a pole. All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it!” '
    9: "⁹ So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone\
      \ who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed! \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Israelites traveled next to Oboth and camped there. '
    11: '¹¹ Then they went on to Iye-abarim, in the wilderness on the eastern border
      of Moab. '
    12: '¹² From there they traveled to the valley of Zered Brook and set up camp. '
    13: '¹³ Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River, in
      the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the boundary
      line between the Moabites and the Amorites. '
    14: '¹⁴ For this reason The Book of the Wars of the Lord speaks of “the town of
      Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the ravines of the Arnon River, '
    15: "¹⁵ and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border\
      \ of Moab.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ From there the Israelites traveled to Beer, which is the well where the
      Lord said to Moses, “Assemble the people, and I will give them water.” '
    17: "¹⁷ There the Israelites sang this song:\n“Spring up, O well!\n    Yes, sing\
      \ its praises!\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Sing of this well,\n    which princes dug,\nwhich great leaders hollowed\
      \ out\n    with their scepters and staffs.”\nThen the Israelites left the wilderness\
      \ and proceeded on through Mattanah, "
    19: '¹⁹ Nahaliel, and Bamoth. '
    20: "²⁰ After that they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Peak overlooks\
      \ the wasteland. \n"
    21: "²¹ The Israelites sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites with this\
      \ message: \n"
    22: "²² “Let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through\
      \ your fields and vineyards. We won’t even drink water from your wells. We will\
      \ stay on the king’s road until we have passed through your territory.” \n"
    23: '²³ But King Sihon refused to let them cross his territory. Instead, he mobilized
      his entire army and attacked Israel in the wilderness, engaging them in battle
      at Jahaz. '
    24: "²⁴ But the Israelites slaughtered them with their swords and occupied their\
      \ land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. They went only as far as the\
      \ Ammonite border because the boundary of the Ammonites was fortified. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So Israel captured all the towns of the Amorites and settled in them,
      including the city of Heshbon and its surrounding villages. '
    26: '²⁶ Heshbon had been the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites. He had defeated
      a former Moabite king and seized all his land as far as the Arnon River. '
    27: "²⁷ Therefore, the ancient poets wrote this about him:\n“Come to Heshbon and\
      \ let it be rebuilt!\n    Let the city of Sihon be restored.\n"
    28: "²⁸ A fire flamed forth from Heshbon,\n    a blaze from the city of Sihon.\n\
      It burned the city of Ar in Moab;\n    it destroyed the rulers of the Arnon\
      \ heights.\n"
    29: "²⁹ What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab!\n    You are finished, O worshipers\
      \ of Chemosh!\nChemosh has left his sons as refugees,\n    his daughters as\
      \ captives of Sihon, the Amorite king.\n"
    30: "³⁰ We have utterly destroyed them,\n    from Heshbon to Dibon.\nWe have completely\
      \ wiped them out\n    as far away as Nophah and Medeba.” \n"
    31: '³¹ So the people of Israel occupied the territory of the Amorites. '
    32: '³² After Moses sent men to explore the Jazer area, they captured all the
      towns in the region and drove out the Amorites who lived there. '
    33: '³³ Then they turned and marched up the road to Bashan, but King Og of Bashan
      and all his people attacked them at Edrei. '
    34: '³⁴ The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him
      over to you, along with all his people and his land. Do the same to him as you
      did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.” '
    35: ³⁵ And Israel killed King Og, his sons, and all his subjects; not a single
      survivor remained. Then Israel occupied their land.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the people of Israel traveled to the plains of Moab and camped east
      of the Jordan River, across from Jericho. '
    2: '² Balak son of Zippor, the Moabite king, had seen everything the Israelites
      did to the Amorites. '
    3: '³ And when the people of Moab saw how many Israelites there were, they were
      terrified. '
    4: "⁴ The king of Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This mob will devour everything\
      \ in sight, like an ox devours grass in the field!”\nSo Balak, king of Moab, "
    5: "⁵ sent messengers to call Balaam son of Beor, who was living in his native\
      \ land of Pethor near the Euphrates River. His message said:\n“Look, a vast\
      \ horde of people has arrived from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and\
      \ are threatening me. "
    6: "⁶ Please come and curse these people for me because they are too powerful\
      \ for me. Then perhaps I will be able to conquer them and drive them from the\
      \ land. I know that blessings fall on any people you bless, and curses fall\
      \ on people you curse.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Balak’s messengers, who were elders of Moab and Midian, set out with money
      to pay Balaam to place a curse upon Israel. They went to Balaam and delivered
      Balak’s message to him. '
    8: "⁸ “Stay here overnight,” Balaam said. “In the morning I will tell you whatever\
      \ the Lord directs me to say.” So the officials from Moab stayed there with\
      \ Balaam. \n"
    9: "⁹ That night God came to Balaam and asked him, “Who are these men visiting\
      \ you?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me this
      message: '
    11: "¹¹ ‘Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt, and they cover the\
      \ face of the earth. Come and curse these people for me. Then perhaps I will\
      \ be able to stand up to them and drive them from the land.’” \n"
    12: "¹² But God told Balaam, “Do not go with them. You are not to curse these\
      \ people, for they have been blessed!” \n"
    13: "¹³ The next morning Balaam got up and told Balak’s officials, “Go on home!\
      \ The Lord will not let me go with you.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Moabite officials returned to King Balak and reported, “Balaam
      refused to come with us.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Balak tried again. This time he sent a larger number of even more
      distinguished officials than those he had sent the first time. '
    16: "¹⁶ They went to Balaam and delivered this message to him:\n“This is what\
      \ Balak son of Zippor says: Please don’t let anything stop you from coming to\
      \ help me. "
    17: "¹⁷ I will pay you very well and do whatever you tell me. Just come and curse\
      \ these people for me!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But Balaam responded to Balak’s messengers, “Even if Balak were to give
      me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything
      against the will of the Lord my God. '
    19: "¹⁹ But stay here one more night, and I will see if the Lord has anything\
      \ else to say to me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ That night God came to Balaam and told him, “Since these men have come\
      \ for you, get up and go with them. But do only what I tell you to do.” \n"
    21: '²¹ So the next morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and started off
      with the Moabite officials. '
    22: '²² But God was angry that Balaam was going, so he sent the angel of the Lord
      to stand in the road to block his way. As Balaam and two servants were riding
      along, '
    23: '²³ Balaam’s donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a
      drawn sword in his hand. The donkey bolted off the road into a field, but Balaam
      beat it and turned it back onto the road. '
    24: '²⁴ Then the angel of the Lord stood at a place where the road narrowed between
      two vineyard walls. '
    25: '²⁵ When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it tried to squeeze by and
      crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam beat the donkey again. '
    26: '²⁶ Then the angel of the Lord moved farther down the road and stood in a
      place too narrow for the donkey to get by at all. '
    27: "²⁷ This time when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down under Balaam. In\
      \ a fit of rage Balaam beat the animal again with his staff. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then the Lord gave the donkey the ability to speak. “What have I done\
      \ to you that deserves your beating me three times?” it asked Balaam. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “You have made me look like a fool!” Balaam shouted. “If I had a sword\
      \ with me, I would kill you!” \n"
    30: "³⁰ “But I am the same donkey you have ridden all your life,” the donkey answered.\
      \ “Have I ever done anything like this before?”\n“No,” Balaam admitted. \n"
    31: "³¹ Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing\
      \ in the roadway with a drawn sword in his hand. Balaam bowed his head and fell\
      \ face down on the ground before him. \n"
    32: '³² “Why did you beat your donkey those three times?” the angel of the Lord
      demanded. “Look, I have come to block your way because you are stubbornly resisting
      me. '
    33: "³³ Three times the donkey saw me and shied away; otherwise, I would certainly\
      \ have killed you by now and spared the donkey.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ Then Balaam confessed to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned. I didn’t\
      \ realize you were standing in the road to block my way. I will return home\
      \ if you are against my going.” \n"
    35: '³⁵ But the angel of the Lord told Balaam, “Go with these men, but say only
      what I tell you to say.” So Balaam went on with Balak’s officials. '
    36: "³⁶ When King Balak heard that Balaam was on the way, he went out to meet\
      \ him at a Moabite town on the Arnon River at the farthest border of his land.\
      \ \n"
    37: "³⁷ “Didn’t I send you an urgent invitation? Why didn’t you come right away?”\
      \ Balak asked Balaam. “Didn’t you believe me when I said I would reward you\
      \ richly?” \n"
    38: '³⁸ Balaam replied, “Look, now I have come, but I have no power to say whatever
      I want. I will speak only the message that God puts in my mouth.” '
    39: '³⁹ Then Balaam accompanied Balak to Kiriath-huzoth, '
    40: '⁴⁰ where the king sacrificed cattle and sheep. He sent portions of the meat
      to Balaam and the officials who were with him. '
    41: ⁴¹ The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could
      see some of the people of Israel spread out below him.
  23:
    1: '¹ Then Balaam said to King Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare
      seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.” '
    2: "² Balak followed his instructions, and the two of them sacrificed a young\
      \ bull and a ram on each altar. \n"
    3: '³ Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offerings, and I will
      go to see if the Lord will respond to me. Then I will tell you whatever he reveals
      to me.” So Balaam went alone to the top of a bare hill, '
    4: "⁴ and God met him there. Balaam said to him, “I have prepared seven altars\
      \ and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord gave Balaam a message for King Balak. Then he said, “Go back to\
      \ Balak and give him my message.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings
      with all the officials of Moab. '
    7: "⁷ This was the message Balaam delivered:\n“Balak summoned me to come from\
      \ Aram;\n    the king of Moab brought me from the eastern hills.\n‘Come,’ he\
      \ said, ‘curse Jacob for me!\n    Come and announce Israel’s doom.’\n"
    8: "⁸ But how can I curse those\n    whom God has not cursed?\nHow can I condemn\
      \ those\n    whom the Lord has not condemned?\n"
    9: "⁹ I see them from the cliff tops;\n    I watch them from the hills.\nI see\
      \ a people who live by themselves,\n    set apart from other nations.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who can count Jacob’s descendants, as numerous as dust?\n    Who can count\
      \ even a fourth of Israel’s people?\nLet me die like the righteous;\n    let\
      \ my life end like theirs.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then King Balak demanded of Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought\
      \ you to curse my enemies. Instead, you have blessed them!” \n"
    12: "¹² But Balaam replied, “I will speak only the message that the Lord puts\
      \ in my mouth.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then King Balak told him, “Come with me to another place. There you will
      see another part of the nation of Israel, but not all of them. Curse at least
      that many!” '
    14: "¹⁴ So Balak took Balaam to the plateau of Zophim on Pisgah Peak. He built\
      \ seven altars there and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here by your burnt offerings while\
      \ I go over there to meet the Lord.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And the Lord met Balaam and gave him a message. Then he said, “Go back\
      \ to Balak and give him my message.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings\
      \ with all the officials of Moab. “What did the Lord say?” Balak asked eagerly.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ This was the message Balaam delivered:\n“Rise up, Balak, and listen!\n\
      \    Hear me, son of Zippor.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ God is not a man, so he does not lie.\n    He is not human, so he does\
      \ not change his mind.\nHas he ever spoken and failed to act?\n    Has he ever\
      \ promised and not carried it through?\n"
    20: "²⁰ Listen, I received a command to bless;\n    God has blessed, and I cannot\
      \ reverse it!\n"
    21: "²¹ No misfortune is in his plan for Jacob;\n    no trouble is in store for\
      \ Israel.\nFor the Lord their God is with them;\n    he has been proclaimed\
      \ their king.\n"
    22: "²² God brought them out of Egypt;\n    for them he is as strong as a wild\
      \ ox.\n"
    23: "²³ No curse can touch Jacob;\n    no magic has any power against Israel.\n\
      For now it will be said of Jacob,\n    ‘What wonders God has done for Israel!’\n"
    24: "²⁴ These people rise up like a lioness,\n    like a majestic lion rousing\
      \ itself.\nThey refuse to rest\n    until they have feasted on prey,\n    drinking\
      \ the blood of the slaughtered!” \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then Balak said to Balaam, “Fine, but if you won’t curse them, at least\
      \ don’t bless them!” \n"
    26: "²⁶ But Balaam replied to Balak, “Didn’t I tell you that I can do only what\
      \ the Lord tells me?” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come, I will take you to one more place.\
      \ Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, overlooking the wasteland. '
    29: '²⁹ Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars, and prepare seven young
      bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.” '
    30: ³⁰ So Balak did as Balaam ordered and offered a young bull and a ram on each
      altar.
  24:
    1: '¹ By now Balaam realized that the Lord was determined to bless Israel, so
      he did not resort to divination as before. Instead, he turned and looked out
      toward the wilderness, '
    2: '² where he saw the people of Israel camped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit
      of God came upon him, '
    3: "³ and this is the message he delivered:\n“This is the message of Balaam son\
      \ of Beor,\n    the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,\n"
    4: "⁴ the message of one who hears the words of God,\n    who sees a vision from\
      \ the Almighty,\n    who bows down with eyes wide open:\n"
    5: "⁵ How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob;\n    how lovely are your homes, O\
      \ Israel!\n"
    6: "⁶ They spread before me like palm groves,\n    like gardens by the riverside.\n\
      They are like tall trees planted by the Lord,\n    like cedars beside the waters.\n"
    7: "⁷ Water will flow from their buckets;\n    their offspring have all they need.\n\
      Their king will be greater than Agag;\n    their kingdom will be exalted.\n"
    8: "⁸ God brought them out of Egypt;\n    for them he is as strong as a wild ox.\n\
      He devours all the nations that oppose him,\n    breaking their bones in pieces,\n\
      \    shooting them with arrows.\n"
    9: "⁹ Like a lion, Israel crouches and lies down;\n    like a lioness, who dares\
      \ to arouse her?\nBlessed is everyone who blesses you, O Israel,\n    and cursed\
      \ is everyone who curses you.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ King Balak flew into a rage against Balaam. He angrily clapped his hands
      and shouted, “I called you to curse my enemies! Instead, you have blessed them
      three times. '
    11: "¹¹ Now get out of here! Go back home! I promised to reward you richly, but\
      \ the Lord has kept you from your reward.” \n"
    12: '¹² Balaam told Balak, “Don’t you remember what I told your messengers? I
      said, '
    13: '¹³ ‘Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold,
      I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the Lord.’ I told you
      that I could say only what the Lord says! '
    14: "¹⁴ Now I am returning to my own people. But first let me tell you what the\
      \ Israelites will do to your people in the future.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the message Balaam delivered:\n“This is the message of Balaam\
      \ son of Beor,\n    the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ the message of one who hears the words of God,\n    who has knowledge\
      \ from the Most High,\nwho sees a vision from the Almighty,\n    who bows down\
      \ with eyes wide open:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I see him, but not here and now.\n    I perceive him, but far in the distant\
      \ future.\nA star will rise from Jacob;\n    a scepter will emerge from Israel.\n\
      It will crush the heads of Moab’s people,\n    cracking the skulls of the people\
      \ of Sheth.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Edom will be taken over,\n    and Seir, its enemy, will be conquered,\n\
      \    while Israel marches on in triumph.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A ruler will rise in Jacob\n    who will destroy the survivors of Ir.”\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Balaam looked over toward the people of Amalek and delivered this\
      \ message:\n“Amalek was the greatest of nations,\n    but its destiny is destruction!”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Then he looked over toward the Kenites and delivered this message:\n“Your\
      \ home is secure;\n    your nest is set in the rocks.\n"
    22: "²² But the Kenites will be destroyed\n    when Assyria takes you captive.”\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Balaam concluded his messages by saying:\n“Alas, who can survive\n   \
      \ unless God has willed it?\n"
    24: "²⁴ Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus;\n    they will oppress Assyria\
      \ and afflict Eber,\n    but they, too, will be utterly destroyed.” \n"
    25: ²⁵ Then Balaam left and returned home, and Balak also went on his way.
  25:
    1: '¹ While the Israelites were camped at Acacia Grove, some of the men defiled
      themselves by having sexual relations with local Moabite women. '
    2: '² These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, so the Israelites
      feasted with them and worshiped the gods of Moab. '
    3: "³ In this way, Israel joined in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the Lord’s\
      \ anger to blaze against his people. \n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord issued the following command to Moses: “Seize all the ringleaders\
      \ and execute them before the Lord in broad daylight, so his fierce anger will\
      \ turn away from the people of Israel.” \n"
    5: "⁵ So Moses ordered Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death the men\
      \ under your authority who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into his tent,
      right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as everyone was weeping at
      the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    7: '⁷ When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this,
      he jumped up and left the assembly. He took a spear '
    8: '⁸ and rushed after the man into his tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the
      way through the man’s body and into the woman’s stomach. So the plague against
      the Israelites was stopped, '
    9: "⁹ but not before 24,000 people had died. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    11: '¹¹ “Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest has turned my
      anger away from the Israelites by being as zealous among them as I was. So I
      stopped destroying all Israel as I had intended to do in my zealous anger. '
    12: '¹² Now tell him that I am making my special covenant of peace with him. '
    13: "¹³ In this covenant, I give him and his descendants a permanent right to\
      \ the priesthood, for in his zeal for me, his God, he purified the people of\
      \ Israel, making them right with me.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son
      of Salu, the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon. '
    15: "¹⁵ The woman’s name was Cozbi; she was the daughter of Zur, the leader of\
      \ a Midianite clan. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Attack the Midianites and destroy them, '
    18: ¹⁸ because they assaulted you with deceit and tricked you into worshiping
      Baal of Peor, and because of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, who
      was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor.”
  26:
    1: '¹ After the plague had ended, the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar son of
      Aaron the priest, '
    2: "² “From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors\
      \ by their families. List all the men twenty years old or older who are able\
      \ to go to war.” \n"
    3: '³ So there on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho,
      Moses and Eleazar the priest issued these instructions to the leaders of Israel: '
    4: "⁴ “List all the men of Israel twenty years old and older, just as the Lord\
      \ commanded Moses.”\nThis is the record of all the descendants of Israel who\
      \ came out of Egypt. \n"
    5: "⁵ These were the clans descended from the sons of Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son:\n\

      and Aaron, rebelling against the Lord. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, and fire
      devoured 250 of their followers. This served as a warning to the entire nation

    62: "⁶² The men from the Levite clans who were one month old or older numbered\
      \ 23,000. But the Levites were not included in the registration of the rest\
      \ of the people of Israel because they were not given an allotment of land when\
      \ it was divided among the Israelites. \n"
    63: '⁶³ So these are the results of the registration of the people of Israel as
      conducted by Moses and Eleazar the priest on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan
      River, across from Jericho. '
    64: '⁶⁴ Not one person on this list had been among those listed in the previous
      registration taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai. '
    65: ⁶⁵ For the Lord had said of them, “They will all die in the wilderness.” Not
      one of them survived except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
  27:
    1: '¹ One day a petition was presented by the daughters of Zelophehad—Mahlah,
      Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. Their father, Zelophehad, was a descendant
      of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph. '
    2: '² These women stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the tribal leaders,
      and the entire community at the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    3: '³ “Our father died in the wilderness,” they said. “He was not among Korah’s
      followers, who rebelled against the Lord; he died because of his own sin. But
      he had no sons. '
    4: "⁴ Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan just because he\
      \ had no sons? Give us property along with the rest of our relatives.” \n"
    5: '⁵ So Moses brought their case before the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And the Lord replied to Moses, '
    7: "⁷ “The claim of the daughters of Zelophehad is legitimate. You must give them\
      \ a grant of land along with their father’s relatives. Assign them the property\
      \ that would have been given to their father. \n"
    8: '⁸ “And give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If a man dies
      and has no son, then give his inheritance to his daughters. '
    9: '⁹ And if he has no daughter either, transfer his inheritance to his brothers. '
    10: '¹⁰ If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. '
    11: "¹¹ But if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest\
      \ relative in his clan. This is a legal requirement for the people of Israel,\
      \ just as the Lord commanded Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² One day the Lord said to Moses, “Climb one of the mountains east of the
      river, and look out over the land I have given the people of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ After you have seen it, you will die like your brother, Aaron, '
    14: "¹⁴ for you both rebelled against my instructions in the wilderness of Zin.\
      \ When the people of Israel rebelled, you failed to demonstrate my holiness\
      \ to them at the waters.” (These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the\
      \ wilderness of Zin.) \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Moses said to the Lord, '
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord, you are the God who gives breath to all creatures. Please appoint
      a new man as leader for the community. '
    17: "¹⁷ Give them someone who will guide them wherever they go and will lead them\
      \ into battle, so the community of the Lord will not be like sheep without a\
      \ shepherd.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The Lord replied, “Take Joshua son of Nun, who has the Spirit in him,
      and lay your hands on him. '
    19: '¹⁹ Present him to Eleazar the priest before the whole community, and publicly
      commission him to lead the people. '
    20: '²⁰ Transfer some of your authority to him so the whole community of Israel
      will obey him. '
    21: "²¹ When direction from the Lord is needed, Joshua will stand before Eleazar\
      \ the priest, who will use the Urim—one of the sacred lots cast before the Lord—to\
      \ determine his will. This is how Joshua and the rest of the community of Israel\
      \ will determine everything they should do.” \n"
    22: '²² So Moses did as the Lord commanded. He presented Joshua to Eleazar the
      priest and the whole community. '
    23: ²³ Moses laid his hands on him and commissioned him to lead the people, just
      as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
  28:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Give these instructions to the people of Israel: The offerings you present\
      \ as special gifts are a pleasing aroma to me; they are my food. See to it that\
      \ they are brought at the appointed times and offered according to my instructions.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ “Say to the people: This is the special gift you must present to the Lord
      as your daily burnt offering. You must offer two one-year-old male lambs with
      no defects. '
    4: '⁴ Sacrifice one lamb in the morning and the other in the evening. '
    5: '⁵ With each lamb you must offer a grain offering of two quarts of choice flour
      mixed with one quart of pure oil of pressed olives. '
    6: '⁶ This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a special
      gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ Along with it you must present the proper liquid offering of one quart of
      alcoholic drink with each lamb, poured out in the Holy Place as an offering
      to the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ Offer the second lamb in the evening with the same grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. It, too, is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “On the Sabbath day, sacrifice two one-year-old male lambs with no defects.
      They must be accompanied by a grain offering of four quarts of choice flour
      moistened with olive oil, and a liquid offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ This is the burnt offering to be presented each Sabbath day, in addition\
      \ to the regular burnt offering and its accompanying liquid offering. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “On the first day of each month, present an extra burnt offering to the
      Lord of two young bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old male lambs, all with
      no defects. '
    12: '¹² These must be accompanied by grain offerings of choice flour moistened
      with olive oil—six quarts with each bull, four quarts with the ram, '
    13: '¹³ and two quarts with each lamb. This burnt offering will be a special gift,
      a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    14: "¹⁴ You must also present a liquid offering with each sacrifice: two quarts\
      \ of wine for each bull, a third of a gallon for the ram, and one quart for\
      \ each lamb. Present this monthly burnt offering on the first day of each month\
      \ throughout the year. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “On the first day of each month, you must also offer one male goat for\
      \ a sin offering to the Lord. This is in addition to the regular burnt offering\
      \ and its accompanying liquid offering. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “On the fourteenth day of the first month, you must celebrate the Lord’s
      Passover. '
    17: '¹⁷ On the following day—the fifteenth day of the month—a joyous, seven-day
      festival will begin, but no bread made with yeast may be eaten. '
    18: '¹⁸ The first day of the festival will be an official day for holy assembly,
      and no ordinary work may be done on that day. '
    19: '¹⁹ As a special gift you must present a burnt offering to the Lord—two young
      bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    20: '²⁰ These will be accompanied by grain offerings of choice flour moistened
      with olive oil—six quarts with each bull, four quarts with the ram, '
    21: '²¹ and two quarts with each of the seven lambs. '
    22: '²² You must also offer a male goat as a sin offering to purify yourselves
      and make yourselves right with the Lord. '
    23: '²³ Present these offerings in addition to your regular morning burnt offering. '
    24: '²⁴ On each of the seven days of the festival, this is how you must prepare
      the food offering that is presented as a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the
      Lord. These will be offered in addition to the regular burnt offerings and liquid
      offerings. '
    25: "²⁵ The seventh day of the festival will be another official day for holy\
      \ assembly, and no ordinary work may be done on that day. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “At the Festival of Harvest, when you present the first of your new grain
      to the Lord, you must call an official day for holy assembly, and you may do
      no ordinary work on that day. '
    27: '²⁷ Present a special burnt offering on that day as a pleasing aroma to the
      Lord. It will consist of two young bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old male
      lambs. '
    28: '²⁸ These will be accompanied by grain offerings of choice flour moistened
      with olive oil—six quarts with each bull, four quarts with the ram, '
    29: '²⁹ and two quarts with each of the seven lambs. '
    30: '³⁰ Also, offer one male goat to purify yourselves and make yourselves right
      with the Lord. '
    31: ³¹ Prepare these special burnt offerings, along with their liquid offerings,
      in addition to the regular burnt offering and its accompanying grain offering.
      Be sure that all the animals you sacrifice have no defects.
  29:
    1: '¹ “Celebrate the Festival of Trumpets each year on the first day of the appointed
      month in early autumn. You must call an official day for holy assembly, and
      you may do no ordinary work. '
    2: '² On that day you must present a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the
      Lord. It will consist of one young bull, one ram, and seven one-year-old male
      lambs, all with no defects. '
    3: '³ These must be accompanied by grain offerings of choice flour moistened with
      olive oil—six quarts with the bull, four quarts with the ram, '
    4: '⁴ and two quarts with each of the seven lambs. '
    5: '⁵ In addition, you must sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering to purify
      yourselves and make yourselves right with the Lord. '
    6: "⁶ These special sacrifices are in addition to your regular monthly and daily\
      \ burnt offerings, and they must be given with their prescribed grain offerings\
      \ and liquid offerings. These offerings are given as a special gift to the Lord,\
      \ a pleasing aroma to him. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Ten days later, on the tenth day of the same month, you must call another
      holy assembly. On that day, the Day of Atonement, the people must go without
      food and must do no ordinary work. '
    8: '⁸ You must present a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. It will
      consist of one young bull, one ram, and seven one-year-old male lambs, all with
      no defects. '
    9: '⁹ These offerings must be accompanied by the prescribed grain offerings of
      choice flour moistened with olive oil—six quarts of choice flour with the bull,
      four quarts of choice flour with the ram, '
    10: '¹⁰ and two quarts of choice flour with each of the seven lambs. '
    11: "¹¹ You must also sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering. This is in addition\
      \ to the sin offering of atonement and the regular daily burnt offering with\
      \ its grain offering, and their accompanying liquid offerings. \n"
    12: '¹² “Five days later, on the fifteenth day of the same month, you must call
      another holy assembly of all the people, and you may do no ordinary work on
      that day. It is the beginning of the Festival of Shelters, a seven-day festival
      to the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ On the first day of the festival, you must present a burnt offering as
      a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. It will consist of thirteen young
      bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    14: '¹⁴ Each of these offerings must be accompanied by a grain offering of choice
      flour moistened with olive oil—six quarts for each of the thirteen bulls, four
      quarts for each of the two rams, '
    15: '¹⁵ and two quarts for each of the fourteen lambs. '
    16: "¹⁶ You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “On the second day of this seven-day festival, sacrifice twelve young
      bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    18: '¹⁸ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    19: "¹⁹ You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “On the third day of the festival, sacrifice eleven young bulls, two rams,
      and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    21: '²¹ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    22: "²² You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    23: '²³ “On the fourth day of the festival, sacrifice ten young bulls, two rams,
      and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    24: '²⁴ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    25: "²⁵ You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “On the fifth day of the festival, sacrifice nine young bulls, two rams,
      and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    27: '²⁷ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    28: "²⁸ You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “On the sixth day of the festival, sacrifice eight young bulls, two rams,
      and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    30: '³⁰ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    31: "³¹ You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    32: '³² “On the seventh day of the festival, sacrifice seven young bulls, two
      rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects. '
    33: '³³ Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied
      by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering. '
    34: "³⁴ You must also sacrifice one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “On the eighth day of the festival, proclaim another holy day. You must
      do no ordinary work on that day. '
    36: '³⁶ You must present a burnt offering as a special gift, a pleasing aroma
      to the Lord. It will consist of one young bull, one ram, and seven one-year-old
      male lambs, all with no defects. '
    37: '³⁷ Each of these offerings must be accompanied by its prescribed grain offering
      and liquid offering. '
    38: "³⁸ You must also sacrifice one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to\
      \ the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid\
      \ offering. \n"
    39: "³⁹ “You must present these offerings to the Lord at your annual festivals.\
      \ These are in addition to the sacrifices and offerings you present in connection\
      \ with vows, or as voluntary offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, liquid\
      \ offerings, or peace offerings.” \n"
    40: ⁴⁰ So Moses gave all of these instructions to the people of Israel as the
      Lord had commanded him.
  30:
    1: '¹ Then Moses summoned the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them, “This
      is what the Lord has commanded: '
    2: "² A man who makes a vow to the Lord or makes a pledge under oath must never\
      \ break it. He must do exactly what he said he would do. \n"
    3: '³ “If a young woman makes a vow to the Lord or a pledge under oath while she
      is still living at her father’s home, '
    4: '⁴ and her father hears of the vow or pledge and does not object to it, then
      all her vows and pledges will stand. '
    5: "⁵ But if her father refuses to let her fulfill the vow or pledge on the day\
      \ he hears of it, then all her vows and pledges will become invalid. The Lord\
      \ will forgive her because her father would not let her fulfill them. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Now suppose a young woman makes a vow or binds herself with an impulsive
      pledge and later marries. '
    7: '⁷ If her husband learns of her vow or pledge and does not object on the day
      he hears of it, her vows and pledges will stand. '
    8: '⁸ But if her husband refuses to accept her vow or impulsive pledge on the
      day he hears of it, he nullifies her commitments, and the Lord will forgive
      her. '
    9: "⁹ If, however, a woman is a widow or is divorced, she must fulfill all her\
      \ vows and pledges. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “But suppose a woman is married and living in her husband’s home when
      she makes a vow or binds herself with a pledge. '
    11: '¹¹ If her husband hears of it and does not object to it, her vow or pledge
      will stand. '
    12: '¹² But if her husband refuses to accept it on the day he hears of it, her
      vow or pledge will be nullified, and the Lord will forgive her. '
    13: '¹³ So her husband may either confirm or nullify any vows or pledges she makes
      to deny herself. '
    14: '¹⁴ But if he does not object on the day he hears of it, then he is agreeing
      to all her vows and pledges. '
    15: "¹⁵ If he waits more than a day and then tries to nullify a vow or pledge,\
      \ he will be punished for her guilt.” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships
      between a man and his wife, and between a father and a young daughter who still
      lives at home.
  31:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “On behalf of the people of Israel, take revenge on the Midianites for leading\
      \ them into idolatry. After that, you will die and join your ancestors.” \n"
    3: '³ So Moses said to the people, “Choose some men, and arm them to fight the
      Lord’s war of revenge against Midian. '
    4: '⁴ From each tribe of Israel, send 1,000 men into battle.” '
    5: '⁵ So they chose 1,000 men from each tribe of Israel, a total of 12,000 men
      armed for battle. '
    6: '⁶ Then Moses sent them out, 1,000 men from each tribe, and Phinehas son of
      Eleazar the priest led them into battle. They carried along the holy objects
      of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the charge. '
    7: '⁷ They attacked Midian as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they killed all
      the men. '
    8: "⁸ All five of the Midianite kings—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—died in the\
      \ battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized
      their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder. '
    10: '¹⁰ They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived. '
    11: '¹¹ After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, '
    12: '¹² they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole
      community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan
      River, across from Jericho. '
    13: '¹³ Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to
      meet them outside the camp. '
    14: "¹⁴ But Moses was furious with all the generals and captains who had returned\
      \ from the battle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Why have you let all the women live?” he demanded. '
    16: '¹⁶ “These are the very ones who followed Balaam’s advice and caused the people
      of Israel to rebel against the Lord at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused
      the plague to strike the Lord’s people. '
    17: '¹⁷ So kill all the boys and all the women who have had intercourse with a
      man. '
    18: '¹⁸ Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves. '
    19: '¹⁹ And all of you who have killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay
      outside the camp for seven days. You must purify yourselves and your captives
      on the third and seventh days. '
    20: "²⁰ Purify all your clothing, too, and everything made of leather, goat hair,\
      \ or wood.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Eleazar the priest said to the men who were in the battle, “The Lord
      has given Moses this legal requirement: '
    22: '²² Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead— '
    23: '²³ that is, all metals that do not burn—must be passed through fire in order
      to be made ceremonially pure. These metal objects must then be further purified
      with the water of purification. But everything that burns must be purified by
      the water alone. '
    24: "²⁴ On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified. Then you\
      \ may return to the camp.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    26: '²⁶ “You and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of each tribe are to
      make a list of all the plunder taken in the battle, including the people and
      animals. '
    27: '²⁷ Then divide the plunder into two parts, and give half to the men who fought
      the battle and half to the rest of the people. '
    28: '²⁸ From the army’s portion, first give the Lord his share of the plunder—one
      of every 500 of the prisoners and of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats. '
    29: '²⁹ Give this share of the army’s half to Eleazar the priest as an offering
      to the Lord. '
    30: '³⁰ From the half that belongs to the people of Israel, take one of every
      fifty of the prisoners and of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals.
      Give this share to the Levites, who are in charge of maintaining the Lord’s
      Tabernacle.” '
    31: "³¹ So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    32: '³² The plunder remaining from everything the fighting men had taken totaled
      675,000 sheep and goats, '
    33: '³³ 72,000 cattle, '
    34: '³⁴ 61,000 donkeys, '
    35: "³⁵ and 32,000 virgin girls. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Half of the plunder was given to the fighting men. It totaled 337,500
      sheep and goats, '
    37: '³⁷ of which 675 were the Lord’s share; '
    38: '³⁸ 36,000 cattle, of which 72 were the Lord’s share; '
    39: '³⁹ 30,500 donkeys, of which 61 were the Lord’s share; '
    40: '⁴⁰ and 16,000 virgin girls, of whom 32 were the Lord’s share. '
    41: "⁴¹ Moses gave all the Lord’s share to Eleazar the priest, just as the Lord\
      \ had directed him. \n"
    42: '⁴² Half of the plunder belonged to the people of Israel, and Moses separated
      it from the half belonging to the fighting men. '
    43: '⁴³ It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats, '
    44: '⁴⁴ 36,000 cattle, '
    45: '⁴⁵ 30,500 donkeys, '
    46: '⁴⁶ and 16,000 virgin girls. '
    47: "⁴⁷ From the half-share given to the people, Moses took one of every fifty\
      \ prisoners and animals and gave them to the Levites, who maintained the Lord’s\
      \ Tabernacle. All this was done as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then all the generals and captains came to Moses '
    49: '⁴⁹ and said, “We, your servants, have accounted for all the men who went
      out to battle under our command; not one of us is missing! '
    50: "⁵⁰ So we are presenting the items of gold we captured as an offering to the\
      \ Lord from our share of the plunder—armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings, and\
      \ necklaces. This will purify our lives before the Lord and make us right with\
      \ him.” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from all the military
      commanders—all kinds of jewelry and crafted objects. '
    52: '⁵² In all, the gold that the generals and captains presented as a gift to
      the Lord weighed about 420 pounds. '
    53: '⁵³ All the fighting men had taken some of the plunder for themselves. '
    54: ⁵⁴ So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gifts from the generals and
      captains and brought the gold to the Tabernacle as a reminder to the Lord that
      the people of Israel belong to him.
  32:
    1: '¹ The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned vast numbers of livestock. So when they
      saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideally suited for their flocks
      and herds, '
    2: '² they came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the other leaders of the community.
      They said, '
    3: '³ “Notice the towns of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah,
      Nebo, and Beon. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord has conquered this whole area for the community of Israel, and
      it is ideally suited for all our livestock. '
    5: "⁵ If we have found favor with you, please let us have this land as our property\
      \ instead of giving us land across the Jordan River.” \n"
    6: '⁶ “Do you intend to stay here while your brothers go across and do all the
      fighting?” Moses asked the men of Gad and Reuben. '
    7: '⁷ “Why do you want to discourage the rest of the people of Israel from going
      across to the land the Lord has given them? '
    8: '⁸ Your ancestors did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to
      explore the land. '
    9: '⁹ After they went up to the valley of Eshcol and explored the land, they discouraged
      the people of Israel from entering the land the Lord was giving them. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord was very angry with them, and he vowed, '
    11: '¹¹ ‘Of all those I rescued from Egypt, no one who is twenty years old or
      older will ever see the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for
      they have not obeyed me wholeheartedly. '
    12: "¹² The only exceptions are Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua\
      \ son of Nun, for they have wholeheartedly followed the Lord.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “The Lord was angry with Israel and made them wander in the wilderness
      for forty years until the entire generation that sinned in the Lord’s sight
      had died. '
    14: '¹⁴ But here you are, a brood of sinners, doing exactly the same thing! You
      are making the Lord even angrier with Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ If you turn away from him like this and he abandons them again in the\
      \ wilderness, you will be responsible for destroying this entire nation!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But they approached Moses and said, “We simply want to build pens for
      our livestock and fortified towns for our wives and children. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then we will arm ourselves and lead our fellow Israelites into battle
      until we have brought them safely to their land. Meanwhile, our families will
      stay in the fortified towns we build here, so they will be safe from any attacks
      by the local people. '
    18: '¹⁸ We will not return to our homes until all the people of Israel have received
      their portions of land. '
    19: "¹⁹ But we do not claim any of the land on the other side of the Jordan. We\
      \ would rather live here on the east side and accept this as our grant of land.”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Moses said, “If you keep your word and arm yourselves for the Lord’s
      battles, '
    21: '²¹ and if your troops cross the Jordan and keep fighting until the Lord has
      driven out his enemies, '
    22: '²² then you may return when the Lord has conquered the land. You will have
      fulfilled your duty to the Lord and to the rest of the people of Israel. And
      the land on the east side of the Jordan will be your property from the Lord. '
    23: '²³ But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the
      Lord, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. '
    24: "²⁴ Go ahead and build towns for your families and pens for your flocks, but\
      \ do everything you have promised.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then the men of Gad and Reuben replied, “We, your servants, will follow
      your instructions exactly. '
    26: '²⁶ Our children, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay here in the towns of
      Gilead. '
    27: "²⁷ But all who are able to bear arms will cross over to fight for the Lord,\
      \ just as you have said.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ So Moses gave orders to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the
      leaders of the clans of Israel. '
    29: '²⁹ He said, “The men of Gad and Reuben who are armed for battle must cross
      the Jordan with you to fight for the Lord. If they do, give them the land of
      Gilead as their property when the land is conquered. '
    30: "³⁰ But if they refuse to arm themselves and cross over with you, then they\
      \ must accept land with the rest of you in the land of Canaan.” \n"
    31: '³¹ The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again, “We are your servants, and we
      will do as the Lord has commanded! '
    32: "³² We will cross the Jordan into Canaan fully armed to fight for the Lord,\
      \ but our property will be here on this side of the Jordan.” \n"
    33: "³³ So Moses assigned land to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe\
      \ of Manasseh son of Joseph. He gave them the territory of King Sihon of the\
      \ Amorites and the land of King Og of Bashan—the whole land with its cities\
      \ and surrounding lands. \n"
    34: '³⁴ The descendants of Gad built the towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, '
    35: '³⁵ Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, '
    36: "³⁶ Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran. These were all fortified towns with pens\
      \ for their flocks. \n"
    37: '³⁷ The descendants of Reuben built the towns of Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, '
    38: "³⁸ Nebo, Baal-meon, and Sibmah. They changed the names of some of the towns\
      \ they conquered and rebuilt. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Then the descendants of Makir of the tribe of Manasseh went to Gilead
      and conquered it, and they drove out the Amorites living there. '
    40: '⁴⁰ So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, descendants of Manasseh, and they
      settled there. '
    41: '⁴¹ The people of Jair, another clan of the tribe of Manasseh, captured many
      of the towns in Gilead and changed the name of that region to the Towns of Jair. '
    42: ⁴² Meanwhile, a man named Nobah captured the town of Kenath and its surrounding
      villages, and he renamed that area Nobah after himself.
  33:
    1: '¹ This is the route the Israelites followed as they marched out of Egypt under
      the leadership of Moses and Aaron. '
    2: "² At the Lord’s direction, Moses kept a written record of their progress.\
      \ These are the stages of their march, identified by the different places where\
      \ they stopped along the way. \n"
    3: '³ They set out from the city of Rameses in early spring—on the fifteenth day
      of the first month—on the morning after the first Passover celebration. The
      people of Israel left defiantly, in full view of all the Egyptians. '
    4: "⁴ Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn sons, whom the\
      \ Lord had killed the night before. The Lord had defeated the gods of Egypt\
      \ that night with great acts of judgment! \n"
    5: "⁵ After leaving Rameses, the Israelites set up camp at Succoth. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then they left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ They left Etham and turned back toward Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon,\
      \ and camped near Migdol. \n"
    8: "⁸ They left Pi-hahiroth and crossed the Red Sea into the wilderness beyond.\
      \ Then they traveled for three days into the Etham wilderness and camped at\
      \ Marah. \n"
    9: "⁹ They left Marah and camped at Elim, where there were twelve springs of water\
      \ and seventy palm trees. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They left Elim and camped beside the Red Sea. \n"
    11: "¹¹ They left the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin. \n"
    12: "¹² They left the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah. \n"
    13: "¹³ They left Dophkah and camped at Alush. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the\
      \ people to drink. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They left Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ They left the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ They left Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez. \n"
    20: "²⁰ They left Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah. \n"
    21: "²¹ They left Libnah and camped at Rissah. \n"
    22: "²² They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. \n"
    23: "²³ They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. \n"
    24: "²⁴ They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. \n"
    25: "²⁵ They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth. \n"
    26: "²⁶ They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath. \n"
    27: "²⁷ They left Tahath and camped at Terah. \n"
    28: "²⁸ They left Terah and camped at Mithcah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ They left Mithcah and camped at Hashmonah. \n"
    30: "³⁰ They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. \n"
    31: "³¹ They left Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan. \n"
    32: "³² They left Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. \n"
    33: "³³ They left Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. \n"
    34: "³⁴ They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. \n"
    35: "³⁵ They left Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber. \n"
    36: "³⁶ They left Ezion-geber and camped at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. \n"
    37: '³⁷ They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the border of Edom. '
    38: '³⁸ While they were at the foot of Mount Hor, Aaron the priest was directed
      by the Lord to go up the mountain, and there he died. This happened in midsummer,
      on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after Israel’s departure
      from Egypt. '
    39: "³⁹ Aaron was 123 years old when he died there on Mount Hor. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ At that time the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the\
      \ land of Canaan, heard that the people of Israel were approaching his land.\
      \ \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Meanwhile, the Israelites left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. \n"
    42: "⁴² Then they left Zalmonah and camped at Punon. \n"
    43: "⁴³ They left Punon and camped at Oboth. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ They left Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ They left Iye-abarim and camped at Dibon-gad. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ They left Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ They left Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains east of the river,\
      \ near Mount Nebo. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ They left the mountains east of the river and camped on the plains of
      Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. '
    49: "⁴⁹ Along the Jordan River they camped from Beth-jeshimoth as far as the meadows\
      \ of Acacia on the plains of Moab. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ While they were camped near the Jordan River on the plains of Moab opposite
      Jericho, the Lord said to Moses, '
    51: '⁵¹ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: When you cross
      the Jordan River into the land of Canaan, '
    52: '⁵² you must drive out all the people living there. You must destroy all their
      carved and molten images and demolish all their pagan shrines. '
    53: '⁵³ Take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given it
      to you to occupy. '
    54: '⁵⁴ You must distribute the land among the clans by sacred lot and in proportion
      to their size. A larger portion of land will be allotted to each of the larger
      clans, and a smaller portion will be allotted to each of the smaller clans.
      The decision of the sacred lot is final. In this way, the portions of land will
      be divided among your ancestral tribes. '
    55: '⁵⁵ But if you fail to drive out the people who live in the land, those who
      remain will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will
      harass you in the land where you live. '
    56: ⁵⁶ And I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Give these instructions to the Israelites: When you come into the land
      of Canaan, which I am giving you as your special possession, these will be the
      boundaries. '
    3: '³ The southern portion of your country will extend from the wilderness of
      Zin, along the edge of Edom. The southern boundary will begin on the east at
      the Dead Sea. '
    4: '⁴ It will then run south past Scorpion Pass in the direction of Zin. Its southernmost
      point will be Kadesh-barnea, from which it will go to Hazar-addar, and on to
      Azmon. '
    5: "⁵ From Azmon the boundary will turn toward the Brook of Egypt and end at the\
      \ Mediterranean Sea. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Your western boundary will be the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Your northern boundary will begin at the Mediterranean Sea and run east
      to Mount Hor, '
    8: '⁸ then to Lebo-hamath, and on through Zedad '
    9: "⁹ and Ziphron to Hazar-enan. This will be your northern boundary. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “The eastern boundary will start at Hazar-enan and run south to Shepham, '
    11: '¹¹ then down to Riblah on the east side of Ain. From there the boundary will
      run down along the eastern edge of the Sea of Galilee, '
    12: "¹² and then along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea. These are the boundaries\
      \ of your land.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Moses told the Israelites, “This territory is the homeland you are
      to divide among yourselves by sacred lot. The Lord has commanded that the land
      be divided among the nine and a half remaining tribes. '
    14: '¹⁴ The families of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh
      have already received their grants of land '
    15: "¹⁵ on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho toward the sunrise.”\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun are the men designated to divide
      the grants of land among the people. '
    18: '¹⁸ Enlist one leader from each tribe to help them with the task. '
    19: '¹⁹ These are the tribes and the names of the leaders:TribeLeaderJudah Caleb
      son of Jephunneh '
    20: '²⁰ Simeon Shemuel son of Ammihud '
    21: '²¹ Benjamin Elidad son of Kislon '
    22: '²² Dan Bukki son of Jogli '
    23: '²³ Manasseh son of Joseph Hanniel son of Ephod '
    24: '²⁴ Ephraim son of Joseph Kemuel son of Shiphtan '
    25: '²⁵ Zebulun Elizaphan son of Parnach '
    26: '²⁶ Issachar Paltiel son of Azzan '
    27: '²⁷ Asher Ahihud son of Shelomi '
    28: "²⁸ Naphtali Pedahel son of Ammihud \n"
    29: ²⁹ These are the men the Lord has appointed to divide the grants of land in
      Canaan among the Israelites.”
  35:
    1: '¹ While Israel was camped beside the Jordan on the plains of Moab across from
      Jericho, the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Command the people of Israel to give to the Levites from their property
      certain towns to live in, along with the surrounding pasturelands. '
    3: '³ These towns will be for the Levites to live in, and the surrounding lands
      will provide pasture for their cattle, flocks, and other livestock. '
    4: '⁴ The pastureland assigned to the Levites around these towns will extend 1,500
      feet from the town walls in every direction. '
    5: "⁵ Measure off 3,000 feet outside the town walls in every direction—east, south,\
      \ west, north—with the town at the center. This area will serve as the larger\
      \ pastureland for the towns. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, where a
      person who has accidentally killed someone can flee for safety. In addition,
      give them forty-two other towns. '
    7: '⁷ In all, forty-eight towns with the surrounding pastureland will be given
      to the Levites. '
    8: "⁸ These towns will come from the property of the people of Israel. The larger\
      \ tribes will give more towns to the Levites, while the smaller tribes will\
      \ give fewer. Each tribe will give property in proportion to the size of its\
      \ land.” \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    10: "¹⁰ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“When you cross\
      \ the Jordan into the land of Canaan, "
    11: '¹¹ designate cities of refuge to which people can flee if they have killed
      someone accidentally. '
    12: '¹² These cities will be places of protection from a dead person’s relatives
      who want to avenge the death. The slayer must not be put to death before being
      tried by the community. '
    13: '¹³ Designate six cities of refuge for yourselves, '
    14: '¹⁴ three on the east side of the Jordan River and three on the west in the
      land of Canaan. '
    15: "¹⁵ These cities are for the protection of Israelites, foreigners living among\
      \ you, and traveling merchants. Anyone who accidentally kills someone may flee\
      \ there for safety. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But if someone strikes and kills another person with a piece of iron,
      it is murder, and the murderer must be executed. '
    17: '¹⁷ Or if someone with a stone in his hand strikes and kills another person,
      it is murder, and the murderer must be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ Or if someone strikes and kills another person with a wooden object, it
      is murder, and the murderer must be put to death. '
    19: '¹⁹ The victim’s nearest relative is responsible for putting the murderer
      to death. When they meet, the avenger must put the murderer to death. '
    20: '²⁰ So if someone hates another person and waits in ambush, then pushes him
      or throws something at him and he dies, it is murder. '
    21: "²¹ Or if someone hates another person and hits him with a fist and he dies,\
      \ it is murder. In such cases, the avenger must put the murderer to death when\
      \ they meet. \n"
    22: '²² “But suppose someone pushes another person without having shown previous
      hostility, or throws something that unintentionally hits another person, '
    23: '²³ or accidentally drops a huge stone on someone, though they were not enemies,
      and the person dies. '
    24: '²⁴ If this should happen, the community must follow these regulations in
      making a judgment between the slayer and the avenger, the victim’s nearest relative: '
    25: "²⁵ The community must protect the slayer from the avenger and must escort\
      \ the slayer back to live in the city of refuge to which he fled. There he must\
      \ remain until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the sacred\
      \ oil. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But if the slayer ever leaves the limits of the city of refuge, '
    27: '²⁷ and the avenger finds him outside the city and kills him, it will not
      be considered murder. '
    28: '²⁸ The slayer should have stayed inside the city of refuge until the death
      of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the slayer may return
      to his own property. '
    29: "²⁹ These are legal requirements for you to observe from generation to generation,\
      \ wherever you may live. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “All murderers must be put to death, but only if evidence is presented
      by more than one witness. No one may be put to death on the testimony of only
      one witness. '
    31: '³¹ Also, you must never accept a ransom payment for the life of someone judged
      guilty of murder and subject to execution; murderers must always be put to death. '
    32: '³² And never accept a ransom payment from someone who has fled to a city
      of refuge, allowing a slayer to return to his property before the death of the
      high priest. '
    33: '³³ This will ensure that the land where you live will not be polluted, for
      murder pollutes the land. And no sacrifice except the execution of the murderer
      can purify the land from murder. '
    34: ³⁴ You must not defile the land where you live, for I live there myself. I
      am the Lord, who lives among the people of Israel.”
  36:
    1: '¹ Then the heads of the clans of Gilead—descendants of Makir, son of Manasseh,
      son of Joseph—came to Moses and the family leaders of Israel with a petition. '
    2: '² They said, “Sir, the Lord instructed you to divide the land by sacred lot
      among the people of Israel. You were told by the Lord to give the grant of land
      owned by our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. '
    3: '³ But if they marry men from another tribe, their grants of land will go with
      them to the tribe into which they marry. In this way, the total area of our
      tribal land will be reduced. '
    4: "⁴ Then when the Year of Jubilee comes, their portion of land will be added\
      \ to that of the new tribe, causing it to be lost forever to our ancestral tribe.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ So Moses gave the Israelites this command from the Lord: “The claim of the
      men of the tribe of Joseph is legitimate. '
    6: '⁶ This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: Let
      them marry anyone they like, as long as it is within their own ancestral tribe. '
    7: '⁷ None of the territorial land may pass from tribe to tribe, for all the land
      given to each tribe must remain within the tribe to which it was first allotted. '
    8: '⁸ The daughters throughout the tribes of Israel who are in line to inherit
      property must marry within their tribe, so that all the Israelites will keep
      their ancestral property. '
    9: "⁹ No grant of land may pass from one tribe to another; each tribe of Israel\
      \ must keep its allotted portion of land.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord commanded Moses. '
    11: '¹¹ Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah all married cousins on their
      father’s side. '
    12: "¹² They married into the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. Thus, their inheritance\
      \ of land remained within their ancestral tribe. \n"
    13: ¹³ These are the commands and regulations that the Lord gave to the people
      of Israel through Moses while they were camped on the plains of Moab beside
      the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
