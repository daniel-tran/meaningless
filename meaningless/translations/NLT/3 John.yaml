3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ This letter is from John, the elder.\nI am writing to Gaius, my dear friend,\
      \ whom I love in the truth. \n"
    2: '² Dear friend, I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in
      body as you are strong in spirit. '
    3: '³ Some of the traveling teachers recently returned and made me very happy
      by telling me about your faithfulness and that you are living according to the
      truth. '
    4: "⁴ I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following\
      \ the truth. \n"
    5: '⁵ Dear friend, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling
      teachers who pass through, even though they are strangers to you. '
    6: '⁶ They have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue
      providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God. '
    7: '⁷ For they are traveling for the Lord, and they accept nothing from people
      who are not believers. '
    8: "⁸ So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as\
      \ they teach the truth. \n"
    9: '⁹ I wrote to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader,
      refuses to have anything to do with us. '
    10: "¹⁰ When I come, I will report some of the things he is doing and the evil\
      \ accusations he is making against us. Not only does he refuse to welcome the\
      \ traveling teachers, he also tells others not to help them. And when they do\
      \ help, he puts them out of the church. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Dear friend, don’t let this bad example influence you. Follow only what\
      \ is good. Remember that those who do good prove that they are God’s children,\
      \ and those who do evil prove that they do not know God. \n"
    12: "¹² Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius, as does the truth itself. We ourselves\
      \ can say the same for him, and you know we speak the truth. \n"
    13: '¹³ I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to write it with pen
      and ink. '
    14: "¹⁴ For I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk face to face. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Peace be with you.\nYour friends here send you their greetings. Please\
      \ give my personal greetings to each of our friends there."
