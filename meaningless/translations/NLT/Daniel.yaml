Daniel:
  1:
    1: '¹ During the third year of King Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar
      of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. '
    2: "² The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim of Judah and permitted him\
      \ to take some of the sacred objects from the Temple of God. So Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ took them back to the land of Babylonia and placed them in the treasure-house\
      \ of his god. \n"
    3: '³ Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace
      some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families, who
      had been brought to Babylon as captives. '
    4: '⁴ “Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. “Make
      sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge
      and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these
      young men in the language and literature of Babylon.” '
    5: "⁵ The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens.\
      \ They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal\
      \ service. \n"
    6: '⁶ Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen,
      all from the tribe of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names:\nDaniel was\
      \ called Belteshazzar.\nHananiah was called Shadrach.\nMishael was called Meshach.\n\
      Azariah was called Abednego. \n"
    8: '⁸ But Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine
      given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to
      eat these unacceptable foods. '
    9: '⁹ Now God had given the chief of staff both respect and affection for Daniel. '
    10: "¹⁰ But he responded, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has ordered that\
      \ you eat this food and wine. If you become pale and thin compared to the other\
      \ youths your age, I am afraid the king will have me beheaded.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Daniel spoke with the attendant who had been appointed by the chief of
      staff to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. '
    12: '¹² “Please test us for ten days on a diet of vegetables and water,” Daniel
      said. '
    13: '¹³ “At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young
      men who are eating the king’s food. Then make your decision in light of what
      you see.” '
    14: "¹⁴ The attendant agreed to Daniel’s suggestion and tested them for ten days.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier
      and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned
      by the king. '
    16: "¹⁶ So after that, the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the food\
      \ and wine provided for the others. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ God gave these four young men an unusual aptitude for understanding every\
      \ aspect of literature and wisdom. And God gave Daniel the special ability to\
      \ interpret the meanings of visions and dreams. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ When the training period ordered by the king was completed, the chief
      of staff brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar. '
    19: '¹⁹ The king talked with them, and no one impressed him as much as Daniel,
      Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the royal service. '
    20: "²⁰ Whenever the king consulted them in any matter requiring wisdom and balanced\
      \ judgment, he found them ten times more capable than any of the magicians and\
      \ enchanters in his entire kingdom. \n"
    21: ²¹ Daniel remained in the royal service until the first year of the reign
      of King Cyrus.
  2:
    1: '¹ One night during the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing
      dreams that he couldn’t sleep. '
    2: '² He called in his magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers, and
      he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed. As they stood before the
      king, '
    3: "³ he said, “I have had a dream that deeply troubles me, and I must know what\
      \ it means.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, “Long live the king!\
      \ Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.” \n"
    5: '⁵ But the king said to the astrologers, “I am serious about this. If you don’t
      tell me what my dream was and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb,
      and your houses will be turned into heaps of rubble! '
    6: "⁶ But if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means, I will give\
      \ you many wonderful gifts and honors. Just tell me the dream and what it means!”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ They said again, “Please, Your Majesty. Tell us the dream, and we will tell\
      \ you what it means.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The king replied, “I know what you are doing! You’re stalling for time because
      you know I am serious when I say, '
    9: "⁹ ‘If you don’t tell me the dream, you are doomed.’ So you have conspired\
      \ to tell me lies, hoping I will change my mind. But tell me the dream, and\
      \ then I’ll know that you can tell me what it means.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The astrologers replied to the king, “No one on earth can tell the king
      his dream! And no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing
      of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer! '
    11: "¹¹ The king’s demand is impossible. No one except the gods can tell you your\
      \ dream, and they do not live here among people.” \n"
    12: '¹² The king was furious when he heard this, and he ordered that all the wise
      men of Babylon be executed. '
    13: "¹³ And because of the king’s decree, men were sent to find and kill Daniel\
      \ and his friends. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, came to kill them, Daniel
      handled the situation with wisdom and discretion. '
    15: '¹⁵ He asked Arioch, “Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?” So Arioch
      told him all that had happened. '
    16: "¹⁶ Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the\
      \ king what the dream meant. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
      what had happened. '
    18: '¹⁸ He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling
      them the secret, so they would not be executed along with the other wise men
      of Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel
      praised the God of heaven. '
    20: "²⁰ He said, \n“Praise the name of God forever and ever,\n    for he has all\
      \ wisdom and power.\n"
    21: "²¹ He controls the course of world events;\n    he removes kings and sets\
      \ up other kings.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise\n    and knowledge to the scholars.\n"
    22: "²² He reveals deep and mysterious things\n    and knows what lies hidden\
      \ in darkness,\n    though he is surrounded by light.\n"
    23: "²³ I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors,\n    for you have given me\
      \ wisdom and strength.\nYou have told me what we asked of you\n    and revealed\
      \ to us what the king demanded.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then Daniel went in to see Arioch, whom the king had ordered to execute\
      \ the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men. Take\
      \ me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning of his dream.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said, “I have found one of\
      \ the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream!”\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ The king said to Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar), “Is this true? Can\
      \ you tell me what my dream was and what it means?” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Daniel replied, “There are no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or fortune-tellers
      who can reveal the king’s secret. '
    28: "²⁸ But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown King\
      \ Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you your dream\
      \ and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about coming events. He
      who reveals secrets has shown you what is going to happen. '
    30: "³⁰ And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else that I know the secret\
      \ of your dream, but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ “In your vision, Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge, shining
      statue of a man. It was a frightening sight. '
    32: '³² The head of the statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were
      silver, its belly and thighs were bronze, '
    33: '³³ its legs were iron, and its feet were a combination of iron and baked
      clay. '
    34: '³⁴ As you watched, a rock was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands.
      It struck the feet of iron and clay, smashing them to bits. '
    35: "³⁵ The whole statue was crushed into small pieces of iron, clay, bronze,\
      \ silver, and gold. Then the wind blew them away without a trace, like chaff\
      \ on a threshing floor. But the rock that knocked the statue down became a great\
      \ mountain that covered the whole earth. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “That was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means. '
    37: '³⁷ Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has given
      you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. '
    38: "³⁸ He has made you the ruler over all the inhabited world and has put even\
      \ the wild animals and birds under your control. You are the head of gold. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “But after your kingdom comes to an end, another kingdom, inferior to
      yours, will rise to take your place. After that kingdom has fallen, yet a third
      kingdom, represented by bronze, will rise to rule the world. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one, as strong as iron.
      That kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires, just as iron smashes
      and crushes everything it strikes. '
    41: '⁴¹ The feet and toes you saw were a combination of iron and baked clay, showing
      that this kingdom will be divided. Like iron mixed with clay, it will have some
      of the strength of iron. '
    42: '⁴² But while some parts of it will be as strong as iron, other parts will
      be as weak as clay. '
    43: "⁴³ This mixture of iron and clay also shows that these kingdoms will try\
      \ to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage.\
      \ But they will not hold together, just as iron and clay do not mix. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
      that will never be destroyed or conquered. It will crush all these kingdoms
      into nothingness, and it will stand forever. '
    45: "⁴⁵ That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain, though not by human\
      \ hands, that crushed to pieces the statue of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and\
      \ gold. The great God was showing the king what will happen in the future. The\
      \ dream is true, and its meaning is certain.” \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Then King Nebuchadnezzar threw himself down before Daniel and worshiped
      him, and he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense
      before him. '
    47: "⁴⁷ The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is the greatest of gods, the\
      \ Lord over kings, a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal\
      \ this secret.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then the king appointed Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable
      gifts. He made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon, as well as chief
      over all his wise men. '
    49: ⁴⁹ At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
      to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel
      remained in the king’s court.
  3:
    1: '¹ King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide
      and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. '
    2: '² Then he sent messages to the high officers, officials, governors, advisers,
      treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to
      the dedication of the statue he had set up. '
    3: "³ So all these officials came and stood before the statue King Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ had set up. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then a herald shouted out, “People of all races and nations and languages,
      listen to the king’s command! '
    5: '⁵ When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and
      other musical instruments, bow to the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s
      gold statue. '
    6: "⁶ Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ So at the sound of the musical instruments, all the people, whatever their\
      \ race or nation or language, bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue\
      \ that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. \n"
    8: '⁸ But some of the astrologers went to the king and informed on the Jews. '
    9: '⁹ They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Long live the king! '
    10: '¹⁰ You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the
      gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
      pipes, and other musical instruments. '
    11: '¹¹ That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into
      a blazing furnace. '
    12: "¹² But there are some Jews—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—whom you have\
      \ put in charge of the province of Babylon. They pay no attention to you, Your\
      \ Majesty. They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue\
      \ you have set up.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach, Meshach,
      and Abednego be brought before him. When they were brought in, '
    14: '¹⁴ Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
      that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up? '
    15: "¹⁵ I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have\
      \ made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments. But if you refuse,\
      \ you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace. And then what god\
      \ will be able to rescue you from my power?” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not
      need to defend ourselves before you. '
    17: '¹⁷ If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able
      to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. '
    18: "¹⁸ But even if he doesn’t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty,\
      \ that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set\
      \ up.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that
      his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated
      seven times hotter than usual. '
    20: '²⁰ Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach,
      Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. '
    21: '²¹ So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace, fully dressed in
      their pants, turbans, robes, and other garments. '
    22: '²² And because the king, in his anger, had demanded such a hot fire in the
      furnace, the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in. '
    23: "²³ So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied, fell into the roaring\
      \ flames. \n"
    24: "²⁴ But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his\
      \ advisers, “Didn’t we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace?”\n\
      “Yes, Your Majesty, we certainly did,” they replied. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Look!” Nebuchadnezzar shouted. “I see four men, unbound, walking around\
      \ in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god!” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming\
      \ furnace and shouted: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most\
      \ High God, come out! Come here!”\nSo Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped\
      \ out of the fire. "
    27: "²⁷ Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around\
      \ them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads\
      \ was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn’t even smell of\
      \ smoke! \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
      Abednego! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They
      defied the king’s command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship
      any god except their own God. '
    29: "²⁹ Therefore, I make this decree: If any people, whatever their race or nation\
      \ or language, speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,\
      \ they will be torn limb from limb, and their houses will be turned into heaps\
      \ of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue like this!” \n"
    30: ³⁰ Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions
      in the province of Babylon.
  4:
    1: "¹ King Nebuchadnezzar sent this message to the people of every race and nation\
      \ and language throughout the world:\n“Peace and prosperity to you! \n"
    2: "² “I want you all to know about the miraculous signs and wonders the Most\
      \ High God has performed for me. \n"
    3: "³ How great are his signs,\n    how powerful his wonders!\nHis kingdom will\
      \ last forever,\n    his rule through all generations. \n"
    4: '⁴ “I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace in comfort and prosperity. '
    5: '⁵ But one night I had a dream that frightened me; I saw visions that terrified
      me as I lay in my bed. '
    6: '⁶ So I issued an order calling in all the wise men of Babylon, so they could
      tell me what my dream meant. '
    7: '⁷ When all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers came
      in, I told them the dream, but they could not tell me what it meant. '
    8: "⁸ At last Daniel came in before me, and I told him the dream. (He was named\
      \ Belteshazzar after my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.) \n"
    9: "⁹ “I said to him, ‘Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit\
      \ of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too great for you to solve.\
      \ Now tell me what my dream means. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘While I was lying in my bed, this is what I dreamed. I saw a large tree
      in the middle of the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ The tree grew very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for
      all the world to see. '
    12: "¹² It had fresh green leaves, and it was loaded with fruit for all to eat.\
      \ Wild animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. All the\
      \ world was fed from this tree. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Then as I lay there dreaming, I saw a messenger, a holy one, coming
      down from heaven. '
    14: "¹⁴ The messenger shouted,\n“Cut down the tree and lop off its branches!\n\
      \    Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit!\nChase the wild animals from\
      \ its shade\n    and the birds from its branches.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But leave the stump and the roots in the ground,\n    bound with a band\
      \ of iron and bronze\n    and surrounded by tender grass.\nNow let him be drenched\
      \ with the dew of heaven,\n    and let him live with the wild animals among\
      \ the plants of the field.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For seven periods of time,\n    let him have the mind of a wild animal\n\
      \    instead of the mind of a human.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For this has been decreed by the messengers;\n    it is commanded by the\
      \ holy ones,\nso that everyone may know\n    that the Most High rules over the\
      \ kingdoms of the world.\nHe gives them to anyone he chooses—\n    even to the\
      \ lowliest of people.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “‘Belteshazzar, that was the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now\
      \ tell me what it means, for none of the wise men of my kingdom can do so. But\
      \ you can tell me because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Upon hearing this, Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar) was overcome for\
      \ a time, frightened by the meaning of the dream. Then the king said to him,\
      \ ‘Belteshazzar, don’t be alarmed by the dream and what it means.’\n“Belteshazzar\
      \ replied, ‘I wish the events foreshadowed in this dream would happen to your\
      \ enemies, my lord, and not to you! "
    20: '²⁰ The tree you saw was growing very tall and strong, reaching high into
      the heavens for all the world to see. '
    21: '²¹ It had fresh green leaves and was loaded with fruit for all to eat. Wild
      animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. '
    22: "²² That tree, Your Majesty, is you. For you have grown strong and great;\
      \ your greatness reaches up to heaven, and your rule to the ends of the earth.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ “‘Then you saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying,\
      \ “Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and the roots in the\
      \ ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass.\
      \ Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals\
      \ of the field for seven periods of time.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ “‘This is what the dream means, Your Majesty, and what the Most High has
      declared will happen to my lord the king. '
    25: '²⁵ You will be driven from human society, and you will live in the fields
      with the wild animals. You will eat grass like a cow, and you will be drenched
      with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass while you live this
      way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world
      and gives them to anyone he chooses. '
    26: "²⁶ But the stump and roots of the tree were left in the ground. This means\
      \ that you will receive your kingdom back again when you have learned that heaven\
      \ rules. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “‘King Nebuchadnezzar, please accept my advice. Stop sinning and do what\
      \ is right. Break from your wicked past and be merciful to the poor. Perhaps\
      \ then you will continue to prosper.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “But all these things did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. '
    29: '²⁹ Twelve months later he was taking a walk on the flat roof of the royal
      palace in Babylon. '
    30: "³⁰ As he looked out across the city, he said, ‘Look at this great city of\
      \ Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal\
      \ residence to display my majestic splendor.’ \n"
    31: '³¹ “While these words were still in his mouth, a voice called down from heaven,
      ‘O King Nebuchadnezzar, this message is for you! You are no longer ruler of
      this kingdom. '
    32: "³² You will be driven from human society. You will live in the fields with\
      \ the wild animals, and you will eat grass like a cow. Seven periods of time\
      \ will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules\
      \ over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses.’ \n"
    33: "³³ “That same hour the judgment was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven\
      \ from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the\
      \ dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles’ feathers\
      \ and his nails were like birds’ claws. \n"
    34: "³⁴ “After this time had passed, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven. My\
      \ sanity returned, and I praised and worshiped the Most High and honored the\
      \ one who lives forever.\nHis rule is everlasting,\n    and his kingdom is eternal.\n"
    35: "³⁵ All the people of the earth\n    are nothing compared to him.\nHe does\
      \ as he pleases\n    among the angels of heaven\n    and among the people of\
      \ the earth.\nNo one can stop him or say to him,\n    ‘What do you mean by doing\
      \ these things?’ \n"
    36: "³⁶ “When my sanity returned to me, so did my honor and glory and kingdom.\
      \ My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored as head of my kingdom,\
      \ with even greater honor than before. \n"
    37: ³⁷ “Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and glorify and honor the King of heaven.
      All his acts are just and true, and he is able to humble the proud.”
  5:
    1: '¹ Many years later King Belshazzar gave a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles,
      and he drank wine with them. '
    2: '² While Belshazzar was drinking the wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold
      and silver cups that his predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the Temple
      in Jerusalem. He wanted to drink from them with his nobles, his wives, and his
      concubines. '
    3: '³ So they brought these gold cups taken from the Temple, the house of God
      in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank
      from them. '
    4: "⁴ While they drank from them they praised their idols made of gold, silver,\
      \ bronze, iron, wood, and stone. \n"
    5: '⁵ Suddenly, they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall
      of the king’s palace, near the lampstand. The king himself saw the hand as it
      wrote, '
    6: "⁶ and his face turned pale with fright. His knees knocked together in fear\
      \ and his legs gave way beneath him. \n"
    7: "⁷ The king shouted for the enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers to\
      \ be brought before him. He said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever can\
      \ read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in purple robes\
      \ of royal honor and will have a gold chain placed around his neck. He will\
      \ become the third highest ruler in the kingdom!” \n"
    8: '⁸ But when all the king’s wise men had come in, none of them could read the
      writing or tell him what it meant. '
    9: "⁹ So the king grew even more alarmed, and his face turned pale. His nobles,\
      \ too, were shaken. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But when the queen mother heard what was happening, she hurried to the
      banquet hall. She said to Belshazzar, “Long live the king! Don’t be so pale
      and frightened. '
    11: '¹¹ There is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy
      gods. During Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, this man was found to have insight, understanding,
      and wisdom like that of the gods. Your predecessor, the king—your predecessor
      King Nebuchadnezzar—made him chief over all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers,
      and fortune-tellers of Babylon. '
    12: "¹² This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has exceptional ability\
      \ and is filled with divine knowledge and understanding. He can interpret dreams,\
      \ explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will\
      \ tell you what the writing means.” \n"
    13: '¹³ So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked him, “Are you
      Daniel, one of the exiles brought from Judah by my predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar? '
    14: '¹⁴ I have heard that you have the spirit of the gods within you and that
      you are filled with insight, understanding, and wisdom. '
    15: '¹⁵ My wise men and enchanters have tried to read the words on the wall and
      tell me their meaning, but they cannot do it. '
    16: "¹⁶ I am told that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems.\
      \ If you can read these words and tell me their meaning, you will be clothed\
      \ in purple robes of royal honor, and you will have a gold chain placed around\
      \ your neck. You will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Daniel answered the king, “Keep your gifts or give them to someone else,
      but I will tell you what the writing means. '
    18: '¹⁸ Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, majesty, glory, and
      honor to your predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar. '
    19: '¹⁹ He made him so great that people of all races and nations and languages
      trembled before him in fear. He killed those he wanted to kill and spared those
      he wanted to spare. He honored those he wanted to honor and disgraced those
      he wanted to disgrace. '
    20: '²⁰ But when his heart and mind were puffed up with arrogance, he was brought
      down from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. '
    21: "²¹ He was driven from human society. He was given the mind of a wild animal,\
      \ and he lived among the wild donkeys. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched\
      \ with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over\
      \ the kingdoms of the world and appoints anyone he desires to rule over them.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² “You are his successor, O Belshazzar, and you knew all this, yet you have
      not humbled yourself. '
    23: '²³ For you have proudly defied the Lord of heaven and have had these cups
      from his Temple brought before you. You and your nobles and your wives and concubines
      have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver, gold, bronze,
      iron, wood, and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all.
      But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls
      your destiny! '
    24: "²⁴ So God has sent this hand to write this message. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “This is the message that was written: Mene, mene, tekel, and Parsin. '
    26: "²⁶ This is what these words mean:\nMene means ‘numbered’—God has numbered\
      \ the days of your reign and has brought it to an end.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Tekel means ‘weighed’—you have been weighed on the balances and have not\
      \ measured up.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Parsin means ‘divided’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the\
      \ Medes and Persians.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was dressed in purple robes, a gold\
      \ chain was hung around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler\
      \ in the kingdom. \n"
    30: "³⁰ That very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king, was killed. \n"
    31: ³¹ And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.
  6:
    1: '¹ Darius the Mede decided to divide the kingdom into 120 provinces, and he
      appointed a high officer to rule over each province. '
    2: '² The king also chose Daniel and two others as administrators to supervise
      the high officers and protect the king’s interests. '
    3: "³ Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other administrators\
      \ and high officers. Because of Daniel’s great ability, the king made plans\
      \ to place him over the entire empire. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some
      fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find
      anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely
      trustworthy. '
    5: "⁵ So they concluded, “Our only chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel\
      \ will be in connection with the rules of his religion.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So the administrators and high officers went to the king and said, “Long
      live King Darius! '
    7: '⁷ We are all in agreement—we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers,
      and governors—that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced.
      Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine
      or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions. '
    8: '⁸ And now, Your Majesty, issue and sign this law so it cannot be changed,
      an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.” '
    9: "⁹ So King Darius signed the law. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went home and
      knelt down as usual in his upstairs room, with its windows open toward Jerusalem.
      He prayed three times a day, just as he had always done, giving thanks to his
      God. '
    11: '¹¹ Then the officials went together to Daniel’s house and found him praying
      and asking for God’s help. '
    12: "¹² So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. “Did\
      \ you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone,\
      \ divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of\
      \ lions?”\n“Yes,” the king replied, “that decision stands; it is an official\
      \ law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then they told the king, “That man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah,\
      \ is ignoring you and your law. He still prays to his God three times a day.”\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Hearing this, the king was deeply troubled, and he tried to think of a\
      \ way to save Daniel. He spent the rest of the day looking for a way to get\
      \ Daniel out of this predicament. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ In the evening the men went together to the king and said, “Your Majesty,\
      \ you know that according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, no law that\
      \ the king signs can be changed.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into\
      \ the den of lions. The king said to him, “May your God, whom you serve so faithfully,\
      \ rescue you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed
      the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one
      could rescue Daniel. '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting. He refused\
      \ his usual entertainment and couldn’t sleep at all that night. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lions’
      den. '
    20: "²⁰ When he got there, he called out in anguish, “Daniel, servant of the living\
      \ God! Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the\
      \ lions?” \n"
    21: '²¹ Daniel answered, “Long live the king! '
    22: "²² My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they would not\
      \ hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged\
      \ you, Your Majesty.” \n"
    23: "²³ The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den.\
      \ Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused\
      \ Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and\
      \ children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit\
      \ the floor of the den. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then King Darius sent this message to the people of every race and nation\
      \ and language throughout the world:\n“Peace and prosperity to you! \n"
    26: "²⁶ “I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with fear\
      \ before the God of Daniel.\nFor he is the living God,\n    and he will endure\
      \ forever.\nHis kingdom will never be destroyed,\n    and his rule will never\
      \ end.\n"
    27: "²⁷ He rescues and saves his people;\n    he performs miraculous signs and\
      \ wonders\n    in the heavens and on earth.\nHe has rescued Daniel\n    from\
      \ the power of the lions.” \n"
    28: ²⁸ So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the
      Persian.
  7:
    1: "¹ Earlier, during the first year of King Belshazzar’s reign in Babylon, Daniel\
      \ had a dream and saw visions as he lay in his bed. He wrote down the dream,\
      \ and this is what he saw. \n"
    2: '² In my vision that night, I, Daniel, saw a great storm churning the surface
      of a great sea, with strong winds blowing from every direction. '
    3: "³ Then four huge beasts came up out of the water, each different from the\
      \ others. \n"
    4: "⁴ The first beast was like a lion with eagles’ wings. As I watched, its wings\
      \ were pulled off, and it was left standing with its two hind feet on the ground,\
      \ like a human being. And it was given a human mind. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up\
      \ on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard\
      \ a voice saying to it, “Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard.\
      \ It had four bird’s wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority\
      \ was given to this beast. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast—terrifying, dreadful,\
      \ and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth\
      \ and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of\
      \ the other beasts, and it had ten horns. \n"
    8: "⁸ As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among\
      \ them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for\
      \ it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting\
      \ arrogantly. \n"
    9: "⁹ I watched as thrones were put in place\n    and the Ancient One sat down\
      \ to judge.\nHis clothing was as white as snow,\n    his hair like purest wool.\n\
      He sat on a fiery throne\n    with wheels of blazing fire,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ and a river of fire was pouring out,\n    flowing from his presence.\n\
      Millions of angels ministered to him;\n    many millions stood to attend him.\n\
      Then the court began its session,\n    and the books were opened. \n"
    11: '¹¹ I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn’s boastful speech.
      I kept watching until the fourth beast was killed and its body was destroyed
      by fire. '
    12: "¹² The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were\
      \ allowed to live a while longer. \n"
    13: '¹³ As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man coming
      with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his
      presence. '
    14: "¹⁴ He was given authority, honor, and sovereignty over all the nations of\
      \ the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey\
      \ him. His rule is eternal—it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ I, Daniel, was troubled by all I had seen, and my visions terrified me. '
    16: '¹⁶ So I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him
      what it all meant. He explained it to me like this: '
    17: '¹⁷ “These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the
      earth. '
    18: "¹⁸ But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom,\
      \ and they will rule forever and ever.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one so
      different from the others and so terrifying. It had devoured and crushed its
      victims with iron teeth and bronze claws, trampling their remains beneath its
      feet. '
    20: '²⁰ I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast’s head and the little
      horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns. This horn
      had seemed greater than the others, and it had human eyes and a mouth that was
      boasting arrogantly. '
    21: '²¹ As I watched, this horn was waging war against God’s holy people and was
      defeating them, '
    22: "²² until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy\
      \ people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ Then he said to me, “This fourth beast is the fourth world power that
      will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour
      the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path. '
    24: '²⁴ Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king
      will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them. '
    25: "²⁵ He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High.\
      \ He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed\
      \ under his control for a time, times, and half a time. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But then the court will pass judgment, and all his power will be taken
      away and completely destroyed. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven\
      \ will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever,\
      \ and all rulers will serve and obey him.” \n"
    28: ²⁸ That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts
      and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.
  8:
    1: '¹ During the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, saw another
      vision, following the one that had already appeared to me. '
    2: "² In this vision I was at the fortress of Susa, in the province of Elam, standing\
      \ beside the Ulai River. \n"
    3: '³ As I looked up, I saw a ram with two long horns standing beside the river.
      One of the horns was longer than the other, even though it had grown later than
      the other one. '
    4: "⁴ The ram butted everything out of his way to the west, to the north, and\
      \ to the south, and no one could stand against him or help his victims. He did\
      \ as he pleased and became very great. \n"
    5: '⁵ While I was watching, suddenly a male goat appeared from the west, crossing
      the land so swiftly that he didn’t even touch the ground. This goat, which had
      one very large horn between its eyes, '
    6: '⁶ headed toward the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the river,
      rushing at him in a rage. '
    7: "⁷ The goat charged furiously at the ram and struck him, breaking off both\
      \ his horns. Now the ram was helpless, and the goat knocked him down and trampled\
      \ him. No one could rescue the ram from the goat’s power. \n"
    8: '⁸ The goat became very powerful. But at the height of his power, his large
      horn was broken off. In the large horn’s place grew four prominent horns pointing
      in the four directions of the earth. '
    9: '⁹ Then from one of the prominent horns came a small horn whose power grew
      very great. It extended toward the south and the east and toward the glorious
      land of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Its power reached to the heavens, where it attacked the heavenly army,
      throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and
      trampling them. '
    11: '¹¹ It even challenged the Commander of heaven’s army by canceling the daily
      sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple. '
    12: "¹² The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion. So\
      \ the daily sacrifice was halted, and truth was overthrown. The horn succeeded\
      \ in everything it did. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other. One of them asked, “How\
      \ long will the events of this vision last? How long will the rebellion that\
      \ causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices? How long will the Temple and\
      \ heaven’s army be trampled on?” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The other replied, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the\
      \ Temple will be made right again.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As I, Daniel, was trying to understand the meaning of this vision, someone
      who looked like a man stood in front of me. '
    16: "¹⁶ And I heard a human voice calling out from the Ulai River, “Gabriel, tell\
      \ this man the meaning of his vision.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ As Gabriel approached the place where I was standing, I became so terrified\
      \ that I fell with my face to the ground. “Son of man,” he said, “you must understand\
      \ that the events you have seen in your vision relate to the time of the end.”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ While he was speaking, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground.\
      \ But Gabriel roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then he said, “I am here to tell you what will happen later in the time
      of wrath. What you have seen pertains to the very end of time. '
    20: '²⁰ The two-horned ram represents the kings of Media and Persia. '
    21: '²¹ The shaggy male goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn
      between his eyes represents the first king of the Greek Empire. '
    22: "²² The four prominent horns that replaced the one large horn show that the\
      \ Greek Empire will break into four kingdoms, but none as great as the first.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “At the end of their rule, when their sin is at its height, a fierce king,
      a master of intrigue, will rise to power. '
    24: '²⁴ He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause a
      shocking amount of destruction and succeed in everything he does. He will destroy
      powerful leaders and devastate the holy people. '
    25: "²⁵ He will be a master of deception and will become arrogant; he will destroy\
      \ many without warning. He will even take on the Prince of princes in battle,\
      \ but he will be broken, though not by human power. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “This vision about the 2,300 evenings and mornings is true. But none of\
      \ these things will happen for a long time, so keep this vision a secret.” \n"
    27: ²⁷ Then I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for several days. Afterward I
      got up and performed my duties for the king, but I was greatly troubled by the
      vision and could not understand it.
  9:
    1: '¹ It was the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus,
      who became king of the Babylonians. '
    2: '² During the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, learned from reading the
      word of the Lord, as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem must lie
      desolate for seventy years. '
    3: "³ So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and fasting.\
      \ I also wore rough burlap and sprinkled myself with ashes. \n"
    4: "⁴ I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed:\n“O Lord, you are a great and\
      \ awesome God! You always fulfill your covenant and keep your promises of unfailing\
      \ love to those who love you and obey your commands. "
    5: '⁵ But we have sinned and done wrong. We have rebelled against you and scorned
      your commands and regulations. '
    6: "⁶ We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets, who spoke on your\
      \ authority to our kings and princes and ancestors and to all the people of\
      \ the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Lord, you are in the right; but as you see, our faces are covered with
      shame. This is true of all of us, including the people of Judah and Jerusalem
      and all Israel, scattered near and far, wherever you have driven us because
      of our disloyalty to you. '
    8: '⁸ O Lord, we and our kings, princes, and ancestors are covered with shame
      because we have sinned against you. '
    9: '⁹ But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled
      against him. '
    10: '¹⁰ We have not obeyed the Lord our God, for we have not followed the instructions
      he gave us through his servants the prophets. '
    11: "¹¹ All Israel has disobeyed your instruction and turned away, refusing to\
      \ listen to your voice.\n“So now the solemn curses and judgments written in\
      \ the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured down on us because\
      \ of our sin. "
    12: '¹² You have kept your word and done to us and our rulers exactly as you warned.
      Never has there been such a disaster as happened in Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ Every curse written against us in the Law of Moses has come true. Yet
      we have refused to seek mercy from the Lord our God by turning from our sins
      and recognizing his truth. '
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, the Lord has brought upon us the disaster he prepared. The\
      \ Lord our God was right to do all of these things, for we did not obey him.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “O Lord our God, you brought lasting honor to your name by rescuing your
      people from Egypt in a great display of power. But we have sinned and are full
      of wickedness. '
    16: "¹⁶ In view of all your faithful mercies, Lord, please turn your furious anger\
      \ away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. All the neighboring nations\
      \ mock Jerusalem and your people because of our sins and the sins of our ancestors.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “O our God, hear your servant’s prayer! Listen as I plead. For your own\
      \ sake, Lord, smile again on your desolate sanctuary. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “O my God, lean down and listen to me. Open your eyes and see our despair.\
      \ See how your city—the city that bears your name—lies in ruins. We make this\
      \ plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and act! For your own sake,\
      \ do not delay, O my God, for your people and your city bear your name.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ I went on praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people, pleading
      with the Lord my God for Jerusalem, his holy mountain. '
    21: '²¹ As I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came
      swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice. '
    22: '²² He explained to me, “Daniel, I have come here to give you insight and
      understanding. '
    23: "²³ The moment you began praying, a command was given. And now I am here to\
      \ tell you what it was, for you are very precious to God. Listen carefully so\
      \ that you can understand the meaning of your vision. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “A period of seventy sets of seven has been decreed for your people and
      your holy city to finish their rebellion, to put an end to their sin, to atone
      for their guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic
      vision, and to anoint the Most Holy Place. '
    25: "²⁵ Now listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of\
      \ seven will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until\
      \ a ruler—the Anointed One—comes. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and\
      \ strong defenses, despite the perilous times. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “After this period of sixty-two sets of seven, the Anointed One will be
      killed, appearing to have accomplished nothing, and a ruler will arise whose
      armies will destroy the city and the Temple. The end will come with a flood,
      and war and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end. '
    27: ²⁷ The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of
      seven, but after half this time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings.
      And as a climax to all his terrible deeds, he will set up a sacrilegious object
      that causes desecration, until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally
      poured out on him.”
  10:
    1: "¹ In the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia, Daniel (also known\
      \ as Belteshazzar) had another vision. He understood that the vision concerned\
      \ events certain to happen in the future—times of war and great hardship. \n"
    2: '² When this vision came to me, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three whole
      weeks. '
    3: "³ All that time I had eaten no rich food. No meat or wine crossed my lips,\
      \ and I used no fragrant lotions until those three weeks had passed. \n"
    4: '⁴ On April 23, as I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River, '
    5: '⁵ I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothing, with a belt of pure
      gold around his waist. '
    6: "⁶ His body looked like a precious gem. His face flashed like lightning, and\
      \ his eyes flamed like torches. His arms and feet shone like polished bronze,\
      \ and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people. \n"
    7: '⁷ Only I, Daniel, saw this vision. The men with me saw nothing, but they were
      suddenly terrified and ran away to hide. '
    8: '⁸ So I was left there all alone to see this amazing vision. My strength left
      me, my face grew deathly pale, and I felt very weak. '
    9: "⁹ Then I heard the man speak, and when I heard the sound of his voice, I fainted\
      \ and lay there with my face to the ground. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Just then a hand touched me and lifted me, still trembling, to my hands
      and knees. '
    11: "¹¹ And the man said to me, “Daniel, you are very precious to God, so listen\
      \ carefully to what I have to say to you. Stand up, for I have been sent to\
      \ you.” When he said this to me, I stood up, still trembling. \n"
    12: '¹² Then he said, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day you began
      to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your request
      has been heard in heaven. I have come in answer to your prayer. '
    13: '¹³ But for twenty-one days the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked
      my way. Then Michael, one of the archangels, came to help me, and I left him
      there with the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia. '
    14: "¹⁴ Now I am here to explain what will happen to your people in the future,\
      \ for this vision concerns a time yet to come.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ While he was speaking to me, I looked down at the ground, unable to say
      a word. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then the one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth
      and began to speak. I said to the one standing in front of me, “I am filled
      with anguish because of the vision I have seen, my lord, and I am very weak. '
    17: "¹⁷ How can someone like me, your servant, talk to you, my lord? My strength\
      \ is gone, and I can hardly breathe.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the one who looked like a man touched me again, and I felt my strength
      returning. '
    19: "¹⁹ “Don’t be afraid,” he said, “for you are very precious to God. Peace!\
      \ Be encouraged! Be strong!”\nAs he spoke these words to me, I suddenly felt\
      \ stronger and said to him, “Please speak to me, my lord, for you have strengthened\
      \ me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ He replied, “Do you know why I have come? Soon I must return to fight
      against the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia, and after that the spirit
      prince of the kingdom of Greece will come. '
    21: ²¹ Meanwhile, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one
      helps me against these spirit princes except Michael, your spirit prince.
  11:
    1: "¹ I have been standing beside Michael to support and strengthen him since\
      \ the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede.) \n"
    2: "² “Now then, I will reveal the truth to you. Three more Persian kings will\
      \ reign, to be succeeded by a fourth, far richer than the others. He will use\
      \ his wealth to stir up everyone to fight against the kingdom of Greece. \n"
    3: '³ “Then a mighty king will rise to power who will rule with great authority
      and accomplish everything he sets out to do. '
    4: "⁴ But at the height of his power, his kingdom will be broken apart and divided\
      \ into four parts. It will not be ruled by the king’s descendants, nor will\
      \ the kingdom hold the authority it once had. For his empire will be uprooted\
      \ and given to others. \n"
    5: "⁵ “The king of the south will increase in power, but one of his own officials\
      \ will become more powerful than he and will rule his kingdom with great strength.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Some years later an alliance will be formed between the king of the north
      and the king of the south. The daughter of the king of the south will be given
      in marriage to the king of the north to secure the alliance, but she will lose
      her influence over him, and so will her father. She will be abandoned along
      with her supporters. '
    7: '⁷ But when one of her relatives becomes king of the south, he will raise an
      army and enter the fortress of the king of the north and defeat him. '
    8: "⁸ When he returns to Egypt, he will carry back their idols with him, along\
      \ with priceless articles of gold and silver. For some years afterward he will\
      \ leave the king of the north alone. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Later the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south
      but will soon return to his own land. '
    10: "¹⁰ However, the sons of the king of the north will assemble a mighty army\
      \ that will advance like a flood and carry the battle as far as the enemy’s\
      \ fortress. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Then, in a rage, the king of the south will rally against the vast forces
      assembled by the king of the north and will defeat them. '
    12: "¹² After the enemy army is swept away, the king of the south will be filled\
      \ with pride and will execute many thousands of his enemies. But his success\
      \ will be short lived. \n"
    13: '¹³ “A few years later the king of the north will return with a fully equipped
      army far greater than before. '
    14: '¹⁴ At that time there will be a general uprising against the king of the
      south. Violent men among your own people will join them in fulfillment of this
      vision, but they will not succeed. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then the king of the north will come and lay siege to a fortified city\
      \ and capture it. The best troops of the south will not be able to stand in\
      \ the face of the onslaught. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “The king of the north will march onward unopposed; none will be able
      to stop him. He will pause in the glorious land of Israel, intent on destroying
      it. '
    17: "¹⁷ He will make plans to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will\
      \ form an alliance with the king of the south. He will give him a daughter in\
      \ marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom from within, but his plan will\
      \ fail. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “After this, he will turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many
      cities. But a commander from another land will put an end to his insolence and
      cause him to retreat in shame. '
    19: "¹⁹ He will take refuge in his own fortresses but will stumble and fall and\
      \ be seen no more. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor.\
      \ But after a very brief reign, he will die, though not from anger or in battle.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ “The next to come to power will be a despicable man who is not in line
      for royal succession. He will slip in when least expected and take over the
      kingdom by flattery and intrigue. '
    22: '²² Before him great armies will be swept away, including a covenant prince. '
    23: '²³ With deceitful promises, he will make various alliances. He will become
      strong despite having only a handful of followers. '
    24: "²⁴ Without warning he will enter the richest areas of the land. Then he will\
      \ distribute among his followers the plunder and wealth of the rich—something\
      \ his predecessors had never done. He will plot the overthrow of strongholds,\
      \ but this will last for only a short while. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Then he will stir up his courage and raise a great army against the king
      of the south. The king of the south will go to battle with a mighty army, but
      to no avail, for there will be plots against him. '
    26: '²⁶ His own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away,
      and many will be killed. '
    27: "²⁷ Seeking nothing but each other’s harm, these kings will plot against each\
      \ other at the conference table, attempting to deceive each other. But it will\
      \ make no difference, for the end will come at the appointed time. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “The king of the north will then return home with great riches. On the\
      \ way he will set himself against the people of the holy covenant, doing much\
      \ damage before continuing his journey. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Then at the appointed time he will once again invade the south, but this
      time the result will be different. '
    30: "³⁰ For warships from western coastlands will scare him off, and he will withdraw\
      \ and return home. But he will vent his anger against the people of the holy\
      \ covenant and reward those who forsake the covenant. \n"
    31: '³¹ “His army will take over the Temple fortress, pollute the sanctuary, put
      a stop to the daily sacrifices, and set up the sacrilegious object that causes
      desecration. '
    32: "³² He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant. But\
      \ the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him. \n"
    33: '³³ “Wise leaders will give instruction to many, but these teachers will die
      by fire and sword, or they will be jailed and robbed. '
    34: '³⁴ During these persecutions, little help will arrive, and many who join
      them will not be sincere. '
    35: "³⁵ And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way, they\
      \ will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end, for\
      \ the appointed time is still to come. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “The king will do as he pleases, exalting himself and claiming to be greater
      than every god, even blaspheming the God of gods. He will succeed, but only
      until the time of wrath is completed. For what has been determined will surely
      take place. '
    37: '³⁷ He will have no respect for the gods of his ancestors, or for the god
      loved by women, or for any other god, for he will boast that he is greater than
      them all. '
    38: '³⁸ Instead of these, he will worship the god of fortresses—a god his ancestors
      never knew—and lavish on him gold, silver, precious stones, and expensive gifts. '
    39: "³⁹ Claiming this foreign god’s help, he will attack the strongest fortresses.\
      \ He will honor those who submit to him, appointing them to positions of authority\
      \ and dividing the land among them as their reward. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “Then at the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the king
      of the north. The king of the north will storm out with chariots, charioteers,
      and a vast navy. He will invade various lands and sweep through them like a
      flood. '
    41: '⁴¹ He will enter the glorious land of Israel, and many nations will fall,
      but Moab, Edom, and the best part of Ammon will escape. '
    42: '⁴² He will conquer many countries, and even Egypt will not escape. '
    43: "⁴³ He will gain control over the gold, silver, and treasures of Egypt, and\
      \ the Libyans and Ethiopians will be his servants. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “But then news from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will
      set out in great anger to destroy and obliterate many. '
    45: ⁴⁵ He will stop between the glorious holy mountain and the sea and will pitch
      his royal tents. But while he is there, his time will suddenly run out, and
      no one will help him.
  12:
    1: '¹ “At that time Michael, the archangel who stands guard over your nation,
      will arise. Then there will be a time of anguish greater than any since nations
      first came into existence. But at that time every one of your people whose name
      is written in the book will be rescued. '
    2: '² Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up, some to everlasting
      life and some to shame and everlasting disgrace. '
    3: '³ Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many
      to righteousness will shine like the stars forever. '
    4: "⁴ But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the\
      \ time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of
      the river. '
    6: "⁶ One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was now standing above the\
      \ river, “How long will it be until these shocking events are over?” \n"
    7: "⁷ The man dressed in linen, who was standing above the river, raised both\
      \ his hands toward heaven and took a solemn oath by the One who lives forever,\
      \ saying, “It will go on for a time, times, and half a time. When the shattering\
      \ of the holy people has finally come to an end, all these things will have\
      \ happened.” \n"
    8: "⁸ I heard what he said, but I did not understand what he meant. So I asked,\
      \ “How will all this finally end, my lord?” \n"
    9: '⁹ But he said, “Go now, Daniel, for what I have said is kept secret and sealed
      until the time of the end. '
    10: "¹⁰ Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined by these trials. But the\
      \ wicked will continue in their wickedness, and none of them will understand.\
      \ Only those who are wise will know what it means. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “From the time the daily sacrifice is stopped and the sacrilegious object
      that causes desecration is set up to be worshiped, there will be 1,290 days. '
    12: "¹² And blessed are those who wait and remain until the end of the 1,335 days!\
      \ \n"
    13: ¹³ “As for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the
      end of the days, you will rise again to receive the inheritance set aside for
      you.”
