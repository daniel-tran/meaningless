Leviticus:
  1:
    1: '¹ The Lord called to Moses from the Tabernacle and said to him, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you present\
      \ an animal as an offering to the Lord, you may take it from your herd of cattle\
      \ or your flock of sheep and goats. \n"
    3: '³ “If the animal you present as a burnt offering is from the herd, it must
      be a male with no defects. Bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle so you
      may be accepted by the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Lay your hand on the animal’s head, and the Lord will accept its death in
      your place to purify you, making you right with him. '
    5: '⁵ Then slaughter the young bull in the Lord’s presence, and Aaron’s sons,
      the priests, will present the animal’s blood by splattering it against all sides
      of the altar that stands at the entrance to the Tabernacle. '
    6: '⁶ Then skin the animal and cut it into pieces. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Aaron the priest will build a wood fire on the altar. '
    8: '⁸ They will arrange the pieces of the offering, including the head and fat,
      on the wood burning on the altar. '
    9: "⁹ But the internal organs and the legs must first be washed with water. Then\
      \ the priest will burn the entire sacrifice on the altar as a burnt offering.\
      \ It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “If the animal you present as a burnt offering is from the flock, it may
      be either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a male with no defects. '
    11: '¹¹ Slaughter the animal on the north side of the altar in the Lord’s presence,
      and Aaron’s sons, the priests, will splatter its blood against all sides of
      the altar. '
    12: '¹² Then cut the animal in pieces, and the priests will arrange the pieces
      of the offering, including the head and fat, on the wood burning on the altar. '
    13: "¹³ But the internal organs and the legs must first be washed with water.\
      \ Then the priest will burn the entire sacrifice on the altar as a burnt offering.\
      \ It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “If you present a bird as a burnt offering to the Lord, choose either
      a turtledove or a young pigeon. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest will take the bird to the altar, wring off its head, and burn
      it on the altar. But first he must drain its blood against the side of the altar. '
    16: '¹⁶ The priest must also remove the crop and the feathers and throw them in
      the ashes on the east side of the altar. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then, grasping the bird by its wings, the priest will tear the bird open,
      but without tearing it apart. Then he will burn it as a burnt offering on the
      wood burning on the altar. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ “When you present grain as an offering to the Lord, the offering must consist
      of choice flour. You are to pour olive oil on it, sprinkle it with frankincense, '
    2: '² and bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. The priest will scoop out a handful
      of the flour moistened with oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn
      this representative portion on the altar. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma
      to the Lord. '
    3: "³ The rest of the grain offering will then be given to Aaron and his sons.\
      \ This offering will be considered a most holy part of the special gifts presented\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ “If your offering is a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be made
      of choice flour, but without any yeast. It may be presented in the form of thin
      cakes mixed with olive oil or wafers spread with olive oil. '
    5: '⁵ If your grain offering is cooked on a griddle, it must be made of choice
      flour mixed with olive oil but without any yeast. '
    6: '⁶ Break it in pieces and pour olive oil on it; it is a grain offering. '
    7: "⁷ If your grain offering is prepared in a pan, it must be made of choice flour\
      \ and olive oil. \n"
    8: '⁸ “No matter how a grain offering for the Lord has been prepared, bring it
      to the priest, who will present it at the altar. '
    9: '⁹ The priest will take a representative portion of the grain offering and
      burn it on the altar. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ The rest of the grain offering will then be given to Aaron and his sons\
      \ as their food. This offering will be considered a most holy part of the special\
      \ gifts presented to the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Do not use yeast in preparing any of the grain offerings you present
      to the Lord, because no yeast or honey may be burned as a special gift presented
      to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² You may add yeast and honey to an offering of the first crops of your
      harvest, but these must never be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma to
      the Lord. '
    13: "¹³ Season all your grain offerings with salt to remind you of God’s eternal\
      \ covenant. Never forget to add salt to your grain offerings. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “If you present a grain offering to the Lord from the first portion of
      your harvest, bring fresh grain that is coarsely ground and roasted on a fire. '
    15: '¹⁵ Put olive oil on this grain offering, and sprinkle it with frankincense. '
    16: ¹⁶ The priest will take a representative portion of the grain moistened with
      oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn it as a special gift presented
      to the Lord.
  3:
    1: '¹ “If you present an animal from the herd as a peace offering to the Lord,
      it may be a male or a female, but it must have no defects. '
    2: '² Lay your hand on the animal’s head, and slaughter it at the entrance of
      the Tabernacle. Then Aaron’s sons, the priests, will splatter its blood against
      all sides of the altar. '
    3: '³ The priest must present part of this peace offering as a special gift to
      the Lord. This includes all the fat around the internal organs, '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe
      of the liver. These must be removed with the kidneys, '
    5: "⁵ and Aaron’s sons will burn them on top of the burnt offering on the wood\
      \ burning on the altar. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ “If you present an animal from the flock as a peace offering to the Lord,
      it may be a male or a female, but it must have no defects. '
    7: '⁷ If you present a sheep as your offering, bring it to the Lord, '
    8: '⁸ lay your hand on its head, and slaughter it in front of the Tabernacle.
      Aaron’s sons will then splatter the sheep’s blood against all sides of the altar. '
    9: '⁹ The priest must present the fat of this peace offering as a special gift
      to the Lord. This includes the fat of the broad tail cut off near the backbone,
      all the fat around the internal organs, '
    10: '¹⁰ the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe
      of the liver. These must be removed with the kidneys, '
    11: "¹¹ and the priest will burn them on the altar. It is a special gift of food\
      \ presented to the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “If you present a goat as your offering, bring it to the Lord, '
    13: '¹³ lay your hand on its head, and slaughter it in front of the Tabernacle.
      Aaron’s sons will then splatter the goat’s blood against all sides of the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ The priest must present part of this offering as a special gift to the
      Lord. This includes all the fat around the internal organs, '
    15: '¹⁵ the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe
      of the liver. These must be removed with the kidneys, '
    16: "¹⁶ and the priest will burn them on the altar. It is a special gift of food,\
      \ a pleasing aroma to the Lord. All the fat belongs to the Lord. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ “You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you,
      and it must be observed from generation to generation, wherever you live.”
  4:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. This is how you\
      \ are to deal with those who sin unintentionally by doing anything that violates\
      \ one of the Lord’s commands. \n"
    3: '³ “If the high priest sins, bringing guilt upon the entire community, he must
      give a sin offering for the sin he has committed. He must present to the Lord
      a young bull with no defects. '
    4: '⁴ He must bring the bull to the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle, lay
      his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter it before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ The high priest will then take some of the bull’s blood into the Tabernacle, '
    6: '⁶ dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord
      in front of the inner curtain of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ The priest will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar for
      fragrant incense that stands in the Lord’s presence inside the Tabernacle. He
      will pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar for burnt
      offerings at the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    8: '⁸ Then the priest must remove all the fat of the bull to be offered as a sin
      offering. This includes all the fat around the internal organs, '
    9: '⁹ the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe
      of the liver. He must remove these along with the kidneys, '
    10: '¹⁰ just as he does with cattle offered as a peace offering, and burn them
      on the altar of burnt offerings. '
    11: '¹¹ But he must take whatever is left of the bull—its hide, meat, head, legs,
      internal organs, and dung— '
    12: "¹² and carry it away to a place outside the camp that is ceremonially clean,\
      \ the place where the ashes are dumped. There, on the ash heap, he will burn\
      \ it on a wood fire. \n"
    13: '¹³ “If the entire Israelite community sins by violating one of the Lord’s
      commands, but the people don’t realize it, they are still guilty. '
    14: '¹⁴ When they become aware of their sin, the people must bring a young bull
      as an offering for their sin and present it before the Tabernacle. '
    15: '¹⁵ The elders of the community must then lay their hands on the bull’s head
      and slaughter it before the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ The high priest will then take some of the bull’s blood into the Tabernacle, '
    17: '¹⁷ dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord
      in front of the inner curtain. '
    18: '¹⁸ He will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar for fragrant
      incense that stands in the Lord’s presence inside the Tabernacle. He will pour
      out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar for burnt offerings at the
      entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the priest must remove all the animal’s fat and burn it on the altar, '
    20: '²⁰ just as he does with the bull offered as a sin offering for the high priest.
      Through this process, the priest will purify the people, making them right with
      the Lord, and they will be forgiven. '
    21: "²¹ Then the priest must take what is left of the bull and carry it outside\
      \ the camp and burn it there, just as is done with the sin offering for the\
      \ high priest. This offering is for the sin of the entire congregation of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² “If one of Israel’s leaders sins by violating one of the commands of the
      Lord his God but doesn’t realize it, he is still guilty. '
    23: '²³ When he becomes aware of his sin, he must bring as his offering a male
      goat with no defects. '
    24: '²⁴ He must lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place
      where burnt offerings are slaughtered before the Lord. This is an offering for
      his sin. '
    25: '²⁵ Then the priest will dip his finger in the blood of the sin offering and
      put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour out the rest
      of the blood at the base of the altar. '
    26: "²⁶ Then he must burn all the goat’s fat on the altar, just as he does with\
      \ the peace offering. Through this process, the priest will purify the leader\
      \ from his sin, making him right with the Lord, and he will be forgiven. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “If any of the common people sin by violating one of the Lord’s commands,
      but they don’t realize it, they are still guilty. '
    28: '²⁸ When they become aware of their sin, they must bring as an offering for
      their sin a female goat with no defects. '
    29: '²⁹ They must lay a hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it
      at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the priest will dip his finger in the blood and put it on the horns
      of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour out the rest of the blood at
      the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ Then he must remove all the goat’s fat, just as he does with the fat of\
      \ the peace offering. He will burn the fat on the altar, and it will be a pleasing\
      \ aroma to the Lord. Through this process, the priest will purify the people,\
      \ making them right with the Lord, and they will be forgiven. \n"
    32: '³² “If the people bring a sheep as their sin offering, it must be a female
      with no defects. '
    33: '³³ They must lay a hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it
      at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered. '
    34: '³⁴ Then the priest will dip his finger in the blood of the sin offering and
      put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour out the rest
      of the blood at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ Then he must remove all the sheep’s fat, just as he does with the fat of
      a sheep presented as a peace offering. He will burn the fat on the altar on
      top of the special gifts presented to the Lord. Through this process, the priest
      will purify the people from their sin, making them right with the Lord, and
      they will be forgiven.
  5:
    1: "¹ “If you are called to testify about something you have seen or that you\
      \ know about, it is sinful to refuse to testify, and you will be punished for\
      \ your sin. \n"
    2: "² “Or suppose you unknowingly touch something that is ceremonially unclean,\
      \ such as the carcass of an unclean animal. When you realize what you have done,\
      \ you must admit your defilement and your guilt. This is true whether it is\
      \ a wild animal, a domestic animal, or an animal that scurries along the ground.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “Or suppose you unknowingly touch something that makes a person unclean.\
      \ When you realize what you have done, you must admit your guilt. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Or suppose you make a foolish vow of any kind, whether its purpose is for\
      \ good or for bad. When you realize its foolishness, you must admit your guilt.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “When you become aware of your guilt in any of these ways, you must confess
      your sin. '
    6: "⁶ Then you must bring to the Lord as the penalty for your sin a female from\
      \ the flock, either a sheep or a goat. This is a sin offering with which the\
      \ priest will purify you from your sin, making you right with the Lord. \n"
    7: '⁷ “But if you cannot afford to bring a sheep, you may bring to the Lord two
      turtledoves or two young pigeons as the penalty for your sin. One of the birds
      will be for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. '
    8: '⁸ You must bring them to the priest, who will present the first bird as the
      sin offering. He will wring its neck but without severing its head from the
      body. '
    9: '⁹ Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering against the
      sides of the altar, and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base
      of the altar. This is an offering for sin. '
    10: "¹⁰ The priest will then prepare the second bird as a burnt offering, following\
      \ all the procedures that have been prescribed. Through this process the priest\
      \ will purify you from your sin, making you right with the Lord, and you will\
      \ be forgiven. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “If you cannot afford to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, you
      may bring two quarts of choice flour for your sin offering. Since it is an offering
      for sin, you must not moisten it with olive oil or put any frankincense on it. '
    12: '¹² Take the flour to the priest, who will scoop out a handful as a representative
      portion. He will burn it on the altar on top of the special gifts presented
      to the Lord. It is an offering for sin. '
    13: "¹³ Through this process, the priest will purify those who are guilty of any\
      \ of these sins, making them right with the Lord, and they will be forgiven.\
      \ The rest of the flour will belong to the priest, just as with the grain offering.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    15: '¹⁵ “If one of you commits a sin by unintentionally defiling the Lord’s sacred
      property, you must bring a guilt offering to the Lord. The offering must be
      your own ram with no defects, or you may buy one of equal value with silver,
      as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. '
    16: "¹⁶ You must make restitution for the sacred property you have harmed by paying\
      \ for the loss, plus an additional 20 percent. When you give the payment to\
      \ the priest, he will purify you with the ram sacrificed as a guilt offering,\
      \ making you right with the Lord, and you will be forgiven. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Suppose you sin by violating one of the Lord’s commands. Even if you
      are unaware of what you have done, you are guilty and will be punished for your
      sin. '
    18: '¹⁸ For a guilt offering, you must bring to the priest your own ram with no
      defects, or you may buy one of equal value. Through this process the priest
      will purify you from your unintentional sin, making you right with the Lord,
      and you will be forgiven. '
    19: ¹⁹ This is a guilt offering, for you have been guilty of an offense against
      the Lord.”
  6:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Suppose one of you sins against your associate and is unfaithful to the
      Lord. Suppose you cheat in a deal involving a security deposit, or you steal
      or commit fraud, '
    3: '³ or you find lost property and lie about it, or you lie while swearing to
      tell the truth, or you commit any other such sin. '
    4: '⁴ If you have sinned in any of these ways, you are guilty. You must give back
      whatever you stole, or the money you took by extortion, or the security deposit,
      or the lost property you found, '
    5: '⁵ or anything obtained by swearing falsely. You must make restitution by paying
      the full price plus an additional 20 percent to the person you have harmed.
      On the same day you must present a guilt offering. '
    6: '⁶ As a guilt offering to the Lord, you must bring to the priest your own ram
      with no defects, or you may buy one of equal value. '
    7: "⁷ Through this process, the priest will purify you before the Lord, making\
      \ you right with him, and you will be forgiven for any of these sins you have\
      \ committed.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    9: '⁹ “Give Aaron and his sons the following instructions regarding the burnt
      offering. The burnt offering must be left on top of the altar until the next
      morning, and the fire on the altar must be kept burning all night. '
    10: '¹⁰ In the morning, after the priest on duty has put on his official linen
      clothing and linen undergarments, he must clean out the ashes of the burnt offering
      and put them beside the altar. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he must take off these garments, change back into his regular clothes,
      and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean. '
    12: '¹² Meanwhile, the fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must never go
      out. Each morning the priest will add fresh wood to the fire and arrange the
      burnt offering on it. He will then burn the fat of the peace offerings on it. '
    13: "¹³ Remember, the fire must be kept burning on the altar at all times. It\
      \ must never go out. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “These are the instructions regarding the grain offering. Aaron’s sons
      must present this offering to the Lord in front of the altar. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest on duty will take from the grain offering a handful of the
      choice flour moistened with olive oil, together with all the frankincense. He
      will burn this representative portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the
      Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ Aaron and his sons may eat the rest of the flour, but it must be baked
      without yeast and eaten in a sacred place within the courtyard of the Tabernacle. '
    17: '¹⁷ Remember, it must never be prepared with yeast. I have given it to the
      priests as their share of the special gifts presented to me. Like the sin offering
      and the guilt offering, it is most holy. '
    18: "¹⁸ Any of Aaron’s male descendants may eat from the special gifts presented\
      \ to the Lord. This is their permanent right from generation to generation.\
      \ Anyone or anything that touches these offerings will become holy.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    20: '²⁰ “On the day Aaron and his sons are anointed, they must present to the
      Lord the standard grain offering of two quarts of choice flour, half to be offered
      in the morning and half to be offered in the evening. '
    21: '²¹ It must be carefully mixed with olive oil and cooked on a griddle. Then
      slice this grain offering and present it as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    22: '²² In each generation, the high priest who succeeds Aaron must prepare this
      same offering. It belongs to the Lord and must be burned up completely. This
      is a permanent law. '
    23: "²³ All such grain offerings of a priest must be burned up entirely. None\
      \ of it may be eaten.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    25: '²⁵ “Give Aaron and his sons the following instructions regarding the sin
      offering. The animal given as an offering for sin is a most holy offering, and
      it must be slaughtered in the Lord’s presence at the place where the burnt offerings
      are slaughtered. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest who offers the sacrifice as a sin offering must eat his portion
      in a sacred place within the courtyard of the Tabernacle. '
    27: '²⁷ Anyone or anything that touches the sacrificial meat will become holy.
      If any of the sacrificial blood spatters on a person’s clothing, the soiled
      garment must be washed in a sacred place. '
    28: '²⁸ If a clay pot is used to boil the sacrificial meat, it must then be broken.
      If a bronze pot is used, it must be scoured and thoroughly rinsed with water. '
    29: '²⁹ Any male from a priest’s family may eat from this offering; it is most
      holy. '
    30: ³⁰ But the offering for sin may not be eaten if its blood was brought into
      the Tabernacle as an offering for purification in the Holy Place. It must be
      completely burned with fire.
  7:
    1: '¹ “These are the instructions for the guilt offering. It is most holy. '
    2: '² The animal sacrificed as a guilt offering must be slaughtered at the place
      where the burnt offerings are slaughtered, and its blood must be splattered
      against all sides of the altar. '
    3: '³ The priest will then offer all its fat on the altar, including the fat of
      the broad tail, the fat around the internal organs, '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe
      of the liver. These are to be removed with the kidneys, '
    5: '⁵ and the priests will burn them on the altar as a special gift presented
      to the Lord. This is the guilt offering. '
    6: "⁶ Any male from a priest’s family may eat the meat. It must be eaten in a\
      \ sacred place, for it is most holy. \n"
    7: '⁷ “The same instructions apply to both the guilt offering and the sin offering.
      Both belong to the priest who uses them to purify someone, making that person
      right with the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ In the case of the burnt offering, the priest may keep the hide of the sacrificed
      animal. '
    9: '⁹ Any grain offering that has been baked in an oven, prepared in a pan, or
      cooked on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it. '
    10: "¹⁰ All other grain offerings, whether made of dry flour or flour moistened\
      \ with olive oil, are to be shared equally among all the priests, the descendants\
      \ of Aaron. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “These are the instructions regarding the different kinds of peace offerings
      that may be presented to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² If you present your peace offering as an expression of thanksgiving, the
      usual animal sacrifice must be accompanied by various kinds of bread made without
      yeast—thin cakes mixed with olive oil, wafers spread with oil, and cakes made
      of choice flour mixed with olive oil. '
    13: '¹³ This peace offering of thanksgiving must also be accompanied by loaves
      of bread made with yeast. '
    14: '¹⁴ One of each kind of bread must be presented as a gift to the Lord. It
      will then belong to the priest who splatters the blood of the peace offering
      against the altar. '
    15: "¹⁵ The meat of the peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the same\
      \ day it is offered. None of it may be saved for the next morning. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “If you bring an offering to fulfill a vow or as a voluntary offering,
      the meat must be eaten on the same day the sacrifice is offered, but whatever
      is left over may be eaten on the second day. '
    17: '¹⁷ Any meat left over until the third day must be completely burned up. '
    18: "¹⁸ If any of the meat from the peace offering is eaten on the third day,\
      \ the person who presented it will not be accepted by the Lord. You will receive\
      \ no credit for offering it. By then the meat will be contaminated; if you eat\
      \ it, you will be punished for your sin. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean may not be eaten; it
      must be completely burned up. The rest of the meat may be eaten, but only by
      people who are ceremonially clean. '
    20: '²⁰ If you are ceremonially unclean and you eat meat from a peace offering
      that was presented to the Lord, you will be cut off from the community. '
    21: "²¹ If you touch anything that is unclean (whether it is human defilement\
      \ or an unclean animal or any other unclean, detestable thing) and then eat\
      \ meat from a peace offering presented to the Lord, you will be cut off from\
      \ the community.” \n"
    22: '²² Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    23: '²³ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. You must never
      eat fat, whether from cattle, sheep, or goats. '
    24: '²⁴ The fat of an animal found dead or torn to pieces by wild animals must
      never be eaten, though it may be used for any other purpose. '
    25: '²⁵ Anyone who eats fat from an animal presented as a special gift to the
      Lord will be cut off from the community. '
    26: '²⁶ No matter where you live, you must never consume the blood of any bird
      or animal. '
    27: "²⁷ Anyone who consumes blood will be cut off from the community.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    29: '²⁹ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you present
      a peace offering to the Lord, bring part of it as a gift to the Lord. '
    30: '³⁰ Present it to the Lord with your own hands as a special gift to the Lord.
      Bring the fat of the animal, together with the breast, and lift up the breast
      as a special offering to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ Then the priest will burn the fat on the altar, but the breast will belong
      to Aaron and his descendants. '
    32: '³² Give the right thigh of your peace offering to the priest as a gift. '
    33: '³³ The right thigh must always be given to the priest who offers the blood
      and the fat of the peace offering. '
    34: '³⁴ For I have reserved the breast of the special offering and the right thigh
      of the sacred offering for the priests. It is the permanent right of Aaron and
      his descendants to share in the peace offerings brought by the people of Israel. '
    35: '³⁵ This is their rightful share. The special gifts presented to the Lord
      have been reserved for Aaron and his descendants from the time they were set
      apart to serve the Lord as priests. '
    36: "³⁶ On the day they were anointed, the Lord commanded the Israelites to give\
      \ these portions to the priests as their permanent share from generation to\
      \ generation.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ These are the instructions for the burnt offering, the grain offering,
      the sin offering, and the guilt offering, as well as the ordination offering
      and the peace offering. '
    38: ³⁸ The Lord gave these instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai when he commanded
      the Israelites to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Bring Aaron and his sons, along with their sacred garments, the anointing
      oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of bread made
      without yeast, '
    3: "³ and call the entire community of Israel together at the entrance of the\
      \ Tabernacle.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Moses followed the Lord’s instructions, and the whole community assembled
      at the Tabernacle entrance. '
    5: '⁵ Moses announced to them, “This is what the Lord has commanded us to do!” '
    6: '⁶ Then he presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ He put the official tunic on Aaron and tied the sash around his waist. He
      dressed him in the robe, placed the ephod on him, and attached the ephod securely
      with its decorative sash. '
    8: '⁸ Then Moses placed the chestpiece on Aaron and put the Urim and the Thummim
      inside it. '
    9: "⁹ He placed the turban on Aaron’s head and attached the gold medallion—the\
      \ badge of holiness—to the front of the turban, just as the Lord had commanded\
      \ him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything
      in it, making them holy. '
    11: '¹¹ He sprinkled the oil on the altar seven times, anointing it and all its
      utensils, as well as the washbasin and its stand, making them holy. '
    12: '¹² Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, anointing him
      and making him holy for his work. '
    13: "¹³ Next Moses presented Aaron’s sons. He clothed them in their tunics, tied\
      \ their sashes around them, and put their special head coverings on them, just\
      \ as the Lord had commanded him. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Moses presented the bull for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the bull’s head, '
    15: '¹⁵ and Moses slaughtered it. Moses took some of the blood, and with his finger
      he put it on the four horns of the altar to purify it. He poured out the rest
      of the blood at the base of the altar. Through this process, he made the altar
      holy by purifying it. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Moses took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe
      of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat around them, and he burned it
      all on the altar. '
    17: "¹⁷ He took the rest of the bull, including its hide, meat, and dung, and\
      \ burned it on a fire outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded him.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the ram’s head, '
    19: '¹⁹ and Moses slaughtered it. Then Moses took the ram’s blood and splattered
      it against all sides of the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ Then he cut the ram into pieces, and he burned the head, some of its pieces,
      and the fat on the altar. '
    21: "²¹ After washing the internal organs and the legs with water, Moses burned\
      \ the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering. It was a pleasing aroma,\
      \ a special gift presented to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Then Moses presented the other ram, which was the ram of ordination. Aaron
      and his sons laid their hands on the ram’s head, '
    23: '²³ and Moses slaughtered it. Then Moses took some of its blood and applied
      it to the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big
      toe of his right foot. '
    24: "²⁴ Next Moses presented Aaron’s sons and applied some of the blood to the\
      \ lobes of their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the big toes\
      \ of their right feet. He then splattered the rest of the blood against all\
      \ sides of the altar. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Next Moses took the fat, including the fat of the broad tail, the fat
      around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys
      and the fat around them, along with the right thigh. '
    26: '²⁶ On top of these he placed a thin cake of bread made without yeast, a cake
      of bread mixed with olive oil, and a wafer spread with olive oil. All these
      were taken from the basket of bread made without yeast that was placed in the
      Lord’s presence. '
    27: '²⁷ He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and he lifted these
      gifts as a special offering to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Moses then took all the offerings back from them and burned them on the
      altar on top of the burnt offering. This was the ordination offering. It was
      a pleasing aroma, a special gift presented to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ Then Moses took the breast and lifted it up as a special offering to the\
      \ Lord. This was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, just as the Lord had\
      \ commanded him. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Next Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was\
      \ on the altar, and he sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons\
      \ and their garments. In this way, he made Aaron and his sons and their garments\
      \ holy. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the remaining meat of the
      offerings at the Tabernacle entrance, and eat it there, along with the bread
      that is in the basket of offerings for the ordination, just as I commanded when
      I said, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’ '
    32: '³² Any meat or bread that is left over must then be burned up. '
    33: '³³ You must not leave the Tabernacle entrance for seven days, for that is
      when the ordination ceremony will be completed. '
    34: '³⁴ Everything we have done today was commanded by the Lord in order to purify
      you, making you right with him. '
    35: '³⁵ Now stay at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days,
      and do everything the Lord requires. If you fail to do this, you will die, for
      this is what the Lord has commanded.” '
    36: ³⁶ So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses.
  9:
    1: '¹ After the ordination ceremony, on the eighth day, Moses called together
      Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. '
    2: '² He said to Aaron, “Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a
      burnt offering, both without defects, and present them to the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then tell the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and take
      a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without defects, for a burnt offering. '
    4: "⁴ Also take a bull and a ram for a peace offering and flour moistened with\
      \ olive oil for a grain offering. Present all these offerings to the Lord because\
      \ the Lord will appear to you today.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ So the people presented all these things at the entrance of the Tabernacle,
      just as Moses had commanded. Then the whole community came forward and stood
      before the Lord. '
    6: "⁶ And Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded you to do so that the\
      \ glory of the Lord may appear to you.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Then Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering\
      \ and your burnt offering to purify yourself and the people. Then present the\
      \ offerings of the people to purify them, making them right with the Lord, just\
      \ as he has commanded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for
      himself. '
    9: '⁹ His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it and put it
      on the horns of the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of
      the altar. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the long lobe of
      the liver from the sin offering, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    11: "¹¹ The meat and the hide, however, he burned outside the camp. \n"
    12: '¹² Next Aaron slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering. His sons brought
      him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the altar. '
    13: '¹³ Then they handed him each piece of the burnt offering, including the head,
      and he burned them on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then he washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on the\
      \ altar along with the rest of the burnt offering. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Next Aaron presented the offerings of the people. He slaughtered the people’s
      goat and presented it as an offering for their sin, just as he had first done
      with the offering for his own sin. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then he presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it in the prescribed
      way. '
    17: "¹⁷ He also presented the grain offering, burning a handful of the flour mixture\
      \ on the altar, in addition to the regular burnt offering for the morning. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Aaron slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people’s peace offering.
      His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the
      altar. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then he took the fat of the bull and the ram—the fat of the broad tail
      and from around the internal organs—along with the kidneys and the long lobes
      of the livers. '
    20: '²⁰ He placed these fat portions on top of the breasts of these animals and
      burned them on the altar. '
    21: "²¹ Aaron then lifted up the breasts and right thighs as a special offering\
      \ to the Lord, just as Moses had commanded. \n"
    22: '²² After that, Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them.
      Then, after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering,
      he stepped down from the altar. '
    23: '²³ Then Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle, and when they came back
      out, they blessed the people again, and the glory of the Lord appeared to the
      whole community. '
    24: ²⁴ Fire blazed forth from the Lord’s presence and consumed the burnt offering
      and the fat on the altar. When the people saw this, they shouted with joy and
      fell face down on the ground.
  10:
    1: '¹ Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners
      and sprinkled incense over them. In this way, they disobeyed the Lord by burning
      before him the wrong kind of fire, different than he had commanded. '
    2: "² So fire blazed forth from the Lord’s presence and burned them up, and they\
      \ died there before the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord meant when he said,\n‘I\
      \ will display my holiness\n    through those who come near me.\nI will display\
      \ my glory\n    before all the people.’”\nAnd Aaron was silent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Moses called for Mishael and Elzaphan, Aaron’s cousins, the sons of
      Aaron’s uncle Uzziel. He said to them, “Come forward and carry away the bodies
      of your relatives from in front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.” '
    5: "⁵ So they came forward and picked them up by their garments and carried them\
      \ out of the camp, just as Moses had commanded. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not show
      grief by leaving your hair uncombed or by tearing your clothes. If you do, you
      will die, and the Lord’s anger will strike the whole community of Israel. However,
      the rest of the Israelites, your relatives, may mourn because of the Lord’s
      fiery destruction of Nadab and Abihu. '
    7: "⁷ But you must not leave the entrance of the Tabernacle or you will die, for\
      \ you have been anointed with the Lord’s anointing oil.” So they did as Moses\
      \ commanded. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord said to Aaron, '
    9: '⁹ “You and your descendants must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink
      before going into the Tabernacle. If you do, you will die. This is a permanent
      law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation. '
    10: '¹⁰ You must distinguish between what is sacred and what is common, between
      what is ceremonially unclean and what is clean. '
    11: "¹¹ And you must teach the Israelites all the decrees that the Lord has given\
      \ them through Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar,
      “Take what is left of the grain offering after a portion has been presented
      as a special gift to the Lord, and eat it beside the altar. Make sure it contains
      no yeast, for it is most holy. '
    13: '¹³ You must eat it in a sacred place, for it has been given to you and your
      descendants as your portion of the special gifts presented to the Lord. These
      are the commands I have been given. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the breast and thigh that were lifted up as a special offering may
      be eaten in any place that is ceremonially clean. These parts have been given
      to you and your descendants as your portion of the peace offerings presented
      by the people of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ You must lift up the thigh and breast as a special offering to the Lord,\
      \ along with the fat of the special gifts. These parts will belong to you and\
      \ your descendants as your permanent right, just as the Lord has commanded.”\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moses then asked them what had happened to the goat of the sin offering.
      When he discovered it had been burned up, he became very angry with Eleazar
      and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons. '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sacred area?” he demanded.
      “It is a holy offering! The Lord has given it to you to remove the guilt of
      the community and to purify the people, making them right with the Lord. '
    18: "¹⁸ Since the animal’s blood was not brought into the Holy Place, you should\
      \ have eaten the meat in the sacred area as I ordered you.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Aaron answered Moses, “Today my sons presented both their sin offering
      and their burnt offering to the Lord. And yet this tragedy has happened to me.
      If I had eaten the people’s sin offering on such a tragic day as this, would
      the Lord have been pleased?” '
    20: ²⁰ And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.\n“Of all the land\
      \ animals, these are the ones you may use for food. "
    3: '³ You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud. '
    4: '⁴ You may not, however, eat the following animals that have split hooves or
      that chew the cud, but not both. The camel chews the cud but does not have split
      hooves, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. '
    5: '⁵ The hyrax chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean. '
    6: '⁶ The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean. '
    7: '⁷ The pig has evenly split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is unclean. '
    8: "⁸ You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses.\
      \ They are ceremonially unclean for you. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Of all the marine animals, these are ones you may use for food. You may
      eat anything from the water if it has both fins and scales, whether taken from
      salt water or from streams. '
    10: '¹⁰ But you must never eat animals from the sea or from rivers that do not
      have both fins and scales. They are detestable to you. This applies both to
      little creatures that live in shallow water and to all creatures that live in
      deep water. '
    11: '¹¹ They will always be detestable to you. You must never eat their meat or
      even touch their dead bodies. '
    12: "¹² Any marine animal that does not have both fins and scales is detestable\
      \ to you. \n"
    13: '¹³ “These are the birds that are detestable to you. You must never eat them:
      the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, '
    14: '¹⁴ the kite, falcons of all kinds, '
    15: '¹⁵ ravens of all kinds, '
    16: '¹⁶ the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds, '
    17: '¹⁷ the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, '
    18: '¹⁸ the barn owl, the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, '
    19: "¹⁹ the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “You must not eat winged insects that walk along the ground; they are
      detestable to you. '
    21: '²¹ You may, however, eat winged insects that walk along the ground and have
      jointed legs so they can jump. '
    22: '²² The insects you are permitted to eat include all kinds of locusts, bald
      locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers. '
    23: "²³ All other winged insects that walk along the ground are detestable to\
      \ you. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “The following creatures will make you ceremonially unclean. If any of
      you touch their carcasses, you will be defiled until evening. '
    25: "²⁵ If you pick up their carcasses, you must wash your clothes, and you will\
      \ remain defiled until evening. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Any animal that has split hooves that are not evenly divided or that
      does not chew the cud is unclean for you. If you touch the carcass of such an
      animal, you will be defiled. '
    27: '²⁷ Of the animals that walk on all fours, those that have paws are unclean.
      If you touch the carcass of such an animal, you will be defiled until evening. '
    28: "²⁸ If you pick up its carcass, you must wash your clothes, and you will remain\
      \ defiled until evening. These animals are unclean for you. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Of the small animals that scurry along the ground, these are unclean
      for you: the mole rat, the rat, large lizards of all kinds, '
    30: '³⁰ the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the sand lizard, and
      the chameleon. '
    31: '³¹ All these small animals are unclean for you. If any of you touch the dead
      body of such an animal, you will be defiled until evening. '
    32: "³² If such an animal dies and falls on something, that object will be unclean.\
      \ This is true whether the object is made of wood, cloth, leather, or burlap.\
      \ Whatever its use, you must dip it in water, and it will remain defiled until\
      \ evening. After that, it will be ceremonially clean and may be used again.\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ “If such an animal falls into a clay pot, everything in the pot will be
      defiled, and the pot must be smashed. '
    34: '³⁴ If the water from such a container spills on any food, the food will be
      defiled. And any beverage in such a container will be defiled. '
    35: "³⁵ Any object on which the carcass of such an animal falls will be defiled.\
      \ If it is an oven or hearth, it must be destroyed, for it is defiled, and you\
      \ must treat it accordingly. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “However, if the carcass of such an animal falls into a spring or a cistern,
      the water will still be clean. But anyone who touches the carcass will be defiled. '
    37: '³⁷ If the carcass falls on seed grain to be planted in the field, the seed
      will still be considered clean. '
    38: "³⁸ But if the seed is wet when the carcass falls on it, the seed will be\
      \ defiled. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “If an animal you are permitted to eat dies and you touch its carcass,
      you will be defiled until evening. '
    40: "⁴⁰ If you eat any of its meat or carry away its carcass, you must wash your\
      \ clothes, and you will remain defiled until evening. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “All small animals that scurry along the ground are detestable, and you
      must never eat them. '
    42: '⁴² This includes all animals that slither along on their bellies, as well
      as those with four legs and those with many feet. All such animals that scurry
      along the ground are detestable, and you must never eat them. '
    43: '⁴³ Do not defile yourselves by touching them. You must not make yourselves
      ceremonially unclean because of them. '
    44: '⁴⁴ For I am the Lord your God. You must consecrate yourselves and be holy,
      because I am holy. So do not defile yourselves with any of these small animals
      that scurry along the ground. '
    45: "⁴⁵ For I, the Lord, am the one who brought you up from the land of Egypt,\
      \ that I might be your God. Therefore, you must be holy because I am holy. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “These are the instructions regarding land animals, birds, marine creatures,
      and animals that scurry along the ground. '
    47: ⁴⁷ By these instructions you will know what is unclean and clean, and which
      animals may be eaten and which may not be eaten.”
  12:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. If a woman becomes
      pregnant and gives birth to a son, she will be ceremonially unclean for seven
      days, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period. '
    3: '³ On the eighth day the boy’s foreskin must be circumcised. '
    4: '⁴ After waiting thirty-three days, she will be purified from the bleeding
      of childbirth. During this time of purification, she must not touch anything
      that is set apart as holy. And she must not enter the sanctuary until her time
      of purification is over. '
    5: "⁵ If a woman gives birth to a daughter, she will be ceremonially unclean for\
      \ two weeks, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period. After waiting\
      \ sixty-six days, she will be purified from the bleeding of childbirth. \n"
    6: '⁶ “When the time of purification is completed for either a son or a daughter,
      the woman must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon
      or turtledove for a purification offering. She must bring her offerings to the
      priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    7: "⁷ The priest will then present them to the Lord to purify her. Then she will\
      \ be ceremonially clean again after her bleeding at childbirth. These are the\
      \ instructions for a woman after the birth of a son or a daughter. \n"
    8: ⁸ “If a woman cannot afford to bring a lamb, she must bring two turtledoves
      or two young pigeons. One will be for the burnt offering and the other for the
      purification offering. The priest will sacrifice them to purify her, and she
      will be ceremonially clean.”
  13:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: '² “If anyone has a swelling or a rash or discolored skin that might develop
      into a serious skin disease, that person must be brought to Aaron the priest
      or to one of his sons. '
    3: "³ The priest will examine the affected area of the skin. If the hair in the\
      \ affected area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep,\
      \ it is a serious skin disease, and the priest who examines it must pronounce\
      \ the person ceremonially unclean. \n"
    4: '⁴ “But if the affected area of the skin is only a white discoloration and
      does not appear to be more than skin-deep, and if the hair on the spot has not
      turned white, the priest will quarantine the person for seven days. '
    5: '⁵ On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds
      the affected area has not changed and the problem has not spread on the skin,
      the priest will quarantine the person for seven more days. '
    6: '⁶ On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds
      the affected area has faded and has not spread, the priest will pronounce the
      person ceremonially clean. It was only a rash. The person’s clothing must be
      washed, and the person will be ceremonially clean. '
    7: '⁷ But if the rash continues to spread after the person has been examined by
      the priest and has been pronounced clean, the infected person must return to
      be examined again. '
    8: "⁸ If the priest finds that the rash has spread, he must pronounce the person\
      \ ceremonially unclean, for it is indeed a skin disease. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Anyone who develops a serious skin disease must go to the priest for an
      examination. '
    10: '¹⁰ If the priest finds a white swelling on the skin, and some hair on the
      spot has turned white, and there is an open sore in the affected area, '
    11: "¹¹ it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce the person\
      \ ceremonially unclean. In such cases the person need not be quarantined, for\
      \ it is obvious that the skin is defiled by the disease. \n"
    12: '¹² “Now suppose the disease has spread all over the person’s skin, covering
      the body from head to foot. '
    13: '¹³ When the priest examines the infected person and finds that the disease
      covers the entire body, he will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. Since
      the skin has turned completely white, the person is clean. '
    14: '¹⁴ But if any open sores appear, the infected person will be pronounced ceremonially
      unclean. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest must make this pronouncement as soon as he sees an open sore,
      since open sores indicate the presence of a skin disease. '
    16: '¹⁶ However, if the open sores heal and turn white like the rest of the skin,
      the person must return to the priest '
    17: "¹⁷ for another examination. If the affected areas have indeed turned white,\
      \ the priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean by declaring,\
      \ ‘You are clean!’ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “If anyone has a boil on the skin that has started to heal, '
    19: '¹⁹ but a white swelling or a reddish white spot develops in its place, that
      person must go to the priest to be examined. '
    20: '²⁰ If the priest examines it and finds it to be more than skin-deep, and
      if the hair in the affected area has turned white, the priest must pronounce
      the person ceremonially unclean. The boil has become a serious skin disease. '
    21: '²¹ But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem
      appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine
      the person for seven days. '
    22: '²² If during that time the affected area spreads on the skin, the priest
      must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, because it is a serious disease. '
    23: "²³ But if the area grows no larger and does not spread, it is merely the\
      \ scar from the boil, and the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially\
      \ clean. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “If anyone has suffered a burn on the skin and the burned area changes
      color, becoming either reddish white or shiny white, '
    25: '²⁵ the priest must examine it. If he finds that the hair in the affected
      area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, a skin
      disease has broken out in the burn. The priest must then pronounce the person
      ceremonially unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease. '
    26: '²⁶ But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem
      appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine
      the infected person for seven days. '
    27: '²⁷ On the seventh day the priest must examine the person again. If the affected
      area has spread on the skin, the priest must pronounce that person ceremonially
      unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease. '
    28: "²⁸ But if the affected area has not changed or spread on the skin and has\
      \ faded, it is simply a swelling from the burn. The priest will then pronounce\
      \ the person ceremonially clean, for it is only the scar from the burn. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “If anyone, either a man or woman, has a sore on the head or chin, '
    30: '³⁰ the priest must examine it. If he finds it is more than skin-deep and
      has fine yellow hair on it, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially
      unclean. It is a scabby sore of the head or chin. '
    31: '³¹ If the priest examines the scabby sore and finds that it is only skin-deep
      but there is no black hair on it, he must quarantine the person for seven days. '
    32: '³² On the seventh day the priest must examine the sore again. If he finds
      that the scabby sore has not spread, and there is no yellow hair on it, and
      it appears to be only skin-deep, '
    33: '³³ the person must shave off all hair except the hair on the affected area.
      Then the priest must quarantine the person for another seven days. '
    34: '³⁴ On the seventh day he will examine the sore again. If it has not spread
      and appears to be no more than skin-deep, the priest will pronounce the person
      ceremonially clean. The person’s clothing must be washed, and the person will
      be ceremonially clean. '
    35: '³⁵ But if the scabby sore begins to spread after the person is pronounced
      clean, '
    36: '³⁶ the priest must do another examination. If he finds that the sore has
      spread, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair. The infected person
      is ceremonially unclean. '
    37: "³⁷ But if the color of the scabby sore does not change and black hair has\
      \ grown on it, it has healed. The priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially\
      \ clean. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “If anyone, either a man or woman, has shiny white patches on the skin, '
    39: "³⁹ the priest must examine the affected area. If he finds that the shiny\
      \ patches are only pale white, this is a harmless skin rash, and the person\
      \ is ceremonially clean. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “If a man loses his hair and his head becomes bald, he is still ceremonially
      clean. '
    41: '⁴¹ And if he loses hair on his forehead, he simply has a bald forehead; he
      is still clean. '
    42: '⁴² However, if a reddish white sore appears on the bald area on top of his
      head or on his forehead, this is a skin disease. '
    43: '⁴³ The priest must examine him, and if he finds swelling around the reddish
      white sore anywhere on the man’s head and it looks like a skin disease, '
    44: "⁴⁴ the man is indeed infected with a skin disease and is unclean. The priest\
      \ must pronounce him ceremonially unclean because of the sore on his head. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ “Those who suffer from a serious skin disease must tear their clothing
      and leave their hair uncombed. They must cover their mouth and call out, ‘Unclean!
      Unclean!’ '
    46: "⁴⁶ As long as the serious disease lasts, they will be ceremonially unclean.\
      \ They must live in isolation in their place outside the camp. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ “Now suppose mildew contaminates some woolen or linen clothing, '
    48: '⁴⁸ woolen or linen fabric, the hide of an animal, or anything made of leather. '
    49: '⁴⁹ If the contaminated area in the clothing, the animal hide, the fabric,
      or the leather article has turned greenish or reddish, it is contaminated with
      mildew and must be shown to the priest. '
    50: '⁵⁰ After examining the affected spot, the priest will put the article in
      quarantine for seven days. '
    51: '⁵¹ On the seventh day the priest must inspect it again. If the contaminated
      area has spread, the clothing or fabric or leather is clearly contaminated by
      a serious mildew and is ceremonially unclean. '
    52: "⁵² The priest must burn the item—the clothing, the woolen or linen fabric,\
      \ or piece of leather—for it has been contaminated by a serious mildew. It must\
      \ be completely destroyed by fire. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has
      not spread in the clothing, the fabric, or the leather, '
    54: '⁵⁴ the priest will order the object to be washed and then quarantined for
      seven more days. '
    55: '⁵⁵ Then the priest must examine the object again. If he finds that the contaminated
      area has not changed color after being washed, even if it did not spread, the
      object is defiled. It must be completely burned up, whether the contaminated
      spot is on the inside or outside. '
    56: '⁵⁶ But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has
      faded after being washed, he must cut the spot from the clothing, the fabric,
      or the leather. '
    57: '⁵⁷ If the spot later reappears on the clothing, the fabric, or the leather
      article, the mildew is clearly spreading, and the contaminated object must be
      burned up. '
    58: "⁵⁸ But if the spot disappears from the clothing, the fabric, or the leather\
      \ article after it has been washed, it must be washed again; then it will be\
      \ ceremonially clean. \n"
    59: ⁵⁹ “These are the instructions for dealing with mildew that contaminates woolen
      or linen clothing or fabric or anything made of leather. This is how the priest
      will determine whether these items are ceremonially clean or unclean.”
  14:
    1: '¹ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “The following instructions are for those seeking ceremonial purification
      from a skin disease. Those who have been healed must be brought to the priest, '
    3: '³ who will examine them at a place outside the camp. If the priest finds that
      someone has been healed of a serious skin disease, '
    4: '⁴ he will perform a purification ceremony, using two live birds that are ceremonially
      clean, a stick of cedar, some scarlet yarn, and a hyssop branch. '
    5: '⁵ The priest will order that one bird be slaughtered over a clay pot filled
      with fresh water. '
    6: '⁶ He will take the live bird, the cedar stick, the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop
      branch, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the
      fresh water. '
    7: "⁷ The priest will then sprinkle the blood of the dead bird seven times on\
      \ the person being purified of the skin disease. When the priest has purified\
      \ the person, he will release the live bird in the open field to fly away. \n"
    8: '⁸ “The persons being purified must then wash their clothes, shave off all
      their hair, and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean
      and may return to the camp. However, they must remain outside their tents for
      seven days. '
    9: "⁹ On the seventh day they must again shave all the hair from their heads,\
      \ including the hair of the beard and eyebrows. They must also wash their clothes\
      \ and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “On the eighth day each person being purified must bring two male lambs
      and a one-year-old female lamb, all with no defects, along with a grain offering
      of six quarts of choice flour moistened with olive oil, and a cup of olive oil. '
    11: '¹¹ Then the officiating priest will present that person for purification,
      along with the offerings, before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    12: '¹² The priest will take one of the male lambs and the olive oil and present
      them as a guilt offering, lifting them up as a special offering before the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ He will then slaughter the male lamb in the sacred area where sin offerings
      and burnt offerings are slaughtered. As with the sin offering, the guilt offering
      belongs to the priest. It is a most holy offering. '
    14: "¹⁴ The priest will then take some of the blood of the guilt offering and\
      \ apply it to the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the\
      \ big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then the priest will pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his
      own left hand. '
    16: '¹⁶ He will dip his right finger into the oil in his palm and sprinkle some
      of it with his finger seven times before the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ The priest will then apply some of the oil in his palm over the blood
      from the guilt offering that is on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the
      right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. '
    18: "¹⁸ The priest will apply the oil remaining in his hand to the head of the\
      \ person being purified. Through this process, the priest will purify the person\
      \ before the Lord. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Then the priest must present the sin offering to purify the person who
      was cured of the skin disease. After that, the priest will slaughter the burnt
      offering '
    20: "²⁰ and offer it on the altar along with the grain offering. Through this\
      \ process, the priest will purify the person who was healed, and the person\
      \ will be ceremonially clean. \n"
    21: '²¹ “But anyone who is too poor and cannot afford these offerings may bring
      one male lamb for a guilt offering, to be lifted up as a special offering for
      purification. The person must also bring two quarts of choice flour moistened
      with olive oil for the grain offering and a cup of olive oil. '
    22: '²² The offering must also include two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever
      the person can afford. One of the pair must be used for the sin offering and
      the other for a burnt offering. '
    23: '²³ On the eighth day of the purification ceremony, the person being purified
      must bring the offerings to the priest in the Lord’s presence at the entrance
      of the Tabernacle. '
    24: '²⁴ The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering, along with the olive
      oil, and lift them up as a special offering to the Lord. '
    25: "²⁵ Then the priest will slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering. He will\
      \ take some of its blood and apply it to the lobe of the right ear, the thumb\
      \ of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “The priest will also pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his
      own left hand. '
    27: '²⁷ He will dip his right finger into the oil in his palm and sprinkle some
      of it seven times before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ The priest will then apply some of the oil in his palm over the blood
      from the guilt offering that is on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the
      right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. '
    29: "²⁹ The priest will apply the oil remaining in his hand to the head of the\
      \ person being purified. Through this process, the priest will purify the person\
      \ before the Lord. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Then the priest will offer the two turtledoves or the two young pigeons,
      whichever the person can afford. '
    31: '³¹ One of them is for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering,
      to be presented along with the grain offering. Through this process, the priest
      will purify the person before the Lord. '
    32: "³² These are the instructions for purification for those who have recovered\
      \ from a serious skin disease but who cannot afford to bring the offerings normally\
      \ required for the ceremony of purification.” \n"
    33: '³³ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    34: '³⁴ “When you arrive in Canaan, the land I am giving you as your own possession,
      I may contaminate some of the houses in your land with mildew. '
    35: '³⁵ The owner of such a house must then go to the priest and say, ‘It appears
      that my house has some kind of mildew.’ '
    36: '³⁶ Before the priest goes in to inspect the house, he must have the house
      emptied so nothing inside will be pronounced ceremonially unclean. '
    37: '³⁷ Then the priest will go in and examine the mildew on the walls. If he
      finds greenish or reddish streaks and the contamination appears to go deeper
      than the wall’s surface, '
    38: '³⁸ the priest will step outside the door and put the house in quarantine
      for seven days. '
    39: '³⁹ On the seventh day the priest must return for another inspection. If he
      finds that the mildew on the walls of the house has spread, '
    40: '⁴⁰ the priest must order that the stones from those areas be removed. The
      contaminated material will then be taken outside the town to an area designated
      as ceremonially unclean. '
    41: '⁴¹ Next the inside walls of the entire house must be scraped thoroughly and
      the scrapings dumped in the unclean place outside the town. '
    42: "⁴² Other stones will be brought in to replace the ones that were removed,\
      \ and the walls will be replastered. \n"
    43: '⁴³ “But if the mildew reappears after all the stones have been replaced and
      the house has been scraped and replastered, '
    44: '⁴⁴ the priest must return and inspect the house again. If he finds that the
      mildew has spread, the walls are clearly contaminated with a serious mildew,
      and the house is defiled. '
    45: '⁴⁵ It must be torn down, and all its stones, timbers, and plaster must be
      carried out of town to the place designated as ceremonially unclean. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Those who enter the house during the period of quarantine will be ceremonially
      unclean until evening, '
    47: "⁴⁷ and all who sleep or eat in the house must wash their clothing. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ “But if the priest returns for his inspection and finds that the mildew
      has not reappeared in the house after the fresh plastering, he will pronounce
      it clean because the mildew is clearly gone. '
    49: '⁴⁹ To purify the house the priest must take two birds, a stick of cedar,
      some scarlet yarn, and a hyssop branch. '
    50: '⁵⁰ He will slaughter one of the birds over a clay pot filled with fresh water. '
    51: '⁵¹ He will take the cedar stick, the hyssop branch, the scarlet yarn, and
      the live bird, and dip them into the blood of the slaughtered bird and into
      the fresh water. Then he will sprinkle the house seven times. '
    52: '⁵² When the priest has purified the house in exactly this way, '
    53: "⁵³ he will release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. Through\
      \ this process, the priest will purify the house, and it will be ceremonially\

    54: '⁵⁴ “These are the instructions for dealing with serious skin diseases, including
      scabby sores; '
    55: '⁵⁵ and mildew, whether on clothing or in a house; '

    4: '⁴ Any bed on which the man with the discharge lies and anything on which he
      sits will be ceremonially unclean. '
    5: '⁵ So if you touch the man’s bed, you must wash your clothes and bathe yourself

    13: '¹³ “When the man with the discharge is healed, he must count off seven days
      for the period of purification. Then he must wash his clothes and bathe himself
      in fresh water, and he will be ceremonially clean. '
    14: '¹⁴ On the eighth day he must get two turtledoves or two young pigeons and
      come before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle and give his offerings
      to the priest. '
    15: "¹⁵ The priest will offer one bird for a sin offering and the other for a\

  16:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron’s two sons, who died after
      they entered the Lord’s presence and burned the wrong kind of fire before him. '
    2: "² The Lord said to Moses, “Warn your brother, Aaron, not to enter the Most\
      \ Holy Place behind the inner curtain whenever he chooses; if he does, he will\
      \ die. For the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement—is there, and I myself am\
      \ present in the cloud above the atonement cover. \n"
    3: '³ “When Aaron enters the sanctuary area, he must follow these instructions
      fully. He must bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. '
    4: '⁴ He must put on his linen tunic and the linen undergarments worn next to
      his body. He must tie the linen sash around his waist and put the linen turban
      on his head. These are sacred garments, so he must bathe himself in water before
      he puts them on. '
    5: "⁵ Aaron must take from the community of Israel two male goats for a sin offering\
      \ and a ram for a burnt offering. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Aaron will present his own bull as a sin offering to purify himself and
      his family, making them right with the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ Then he must take the two male goats and present them to the Lord at the
      entrance of the Tabernacle. '
    8: '⁸ He is to cast sacred lots to determine which goat will be reserved as an
      offering to the Lord and which will carry the sins of the people to the wilderness
      of Azazel. '
    9: '⁹ Aaron will then present as a sin offering the goat chosen by lot for the
      Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ The other goat, the scapegoat chosen by lot to be sent away, will be kept\
      \ alive, standing before the Lord. When it is sent away to Azazel in the wilderness,\
      \ the people will be purified and made right with the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Aaron will present his own bull as a sin offering to purify himself and
      his family, making them right with the Lord. After he has slaughtered the bull
      as a sin offering, '
    12: '¹² he will fill an incense burner with burning coals from the altar that
      stands before the Lord. Then he will take two handfuls of fragrant powdered
      incense and will carry the burner and the incense behind the inner curtain. '
    13: '¹³ There in the Lord’s presence he will put the incense on the burning coals
      so that a cloud of incense will rise over the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement—that
      rests on the Ark of the Covenant. If he follows these instructions, he will
      not die. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then he must take some of the blood of the bull, dip his finger in it,\
      \ and sprinkle it on the east side of the atonement cover. He must sprinkle\
      \ blood seven times with his finger in front of the atonement cover. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then Aaron must slaughter the first goat as a sin offering for the people
      and carry its blood behind the inner curtain. There he will sprinkle the goat’s
      blood over the atonement cover and in front of it, just as he did with the bull’s
      blood. '
    16: '¹⁶ Through this process, he will purify the Most Holy Place, and he will
      do the same for the entire Tabernacle, because of the defiling sin and rebellion
      of the Israelites. '
    17: "¹⁷ No one else is allowed inside the Tabernacle when Aaron enters it for\
      \ the purification ceremony in the Most Holy Place. No one may enter until he\

      \ of Israel, making them right with the Lord. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then Aaron will come out to purify the altar that stands before the Lord.
      He will do this by taking some of the blood from the bull and the goat and putting
      it on each of the horns of the altar. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he must sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times over the altar.\
      \ In this way, he will cleanse it from Israel’s defilement and make it holy.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “When Aaron has finished purifying the Most Holy Place and the Tabernacle
      and the altar, he must present the live goat. '
    21: '²¹ He will lay both of his hands on the goat’s head and confess over it all
      the wickedness, rebellion, and sins of the people of Israel. In this way, he
      will transfer the people’s sins to the head of the goat. Then a man specially
      chosen for the task will drive the goat into the wilderness. '
    22: "²² As the goat goes into the wilderness, it will carry all the people’s sins\
      \ upon itself into a desolate land. \n"
    23: '²³ “When Aaron goes back into the Tabernacle, he must take off the linen
      garments he was wearing when he entered the Most Holy Place, and he must leave
      the garments there. '
    24: '²⁴ Then he must bathe himself with water in a sacred place, put on his regular
      garments, and go out to sacrifice a burnt offering for himself and a burnt offering
      for the people. Through this process, he will purify himself and the people,
      making them right with the Lord. '
    25: "²⁵ He must then burn all the fat of the sin offering on the altar. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “The man chosen to drive the scapegoat into the wilderness of Azazel must\
      \ wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. Then he may return to the camp.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “The bull and the goat presented as sin offerings, whose blood Aaron takes
      into the Most Holy Place for the purification ceremony, will be carried outside
      the camp. The animals’ hides, internal organs, and dung are all to be burned. '
    28: "²⁸ The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water\
      \ before returning to the camp. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “On the tenth day of the appointed month in early autumn, you must deny
      yourselves. Neither native-born Israelites nor foreigners living among you may
      do any kind of work. This is a permanent law for you. '
    30: '³⁰ On that day offerings of purification will be made for you, and you will
      be purified in the Lord’s presence from all your sins. '
    31: '³¹ It will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you, and you must deny yourselves.
      This is a permanent law for you. '
    32: '³² In future generations, the purification ceremony will be performed by
      the priest who has been anointed and ordained to serve as high priest in place
      of his ancestor Aaron. He will put on the holy linen garments '
    33: '³³ and purify the Most Holy Place, the Tabernacle, the altar, the priests,
      and the entire congregation. '
    34: "³⁴ This is a permanent law for you, to purify the people of Israel from their\
      \ sins, making them right with the Lord once each year.”\nMoses followed all\
      \ these instructions exactly as the Lord had commanded him."
  17:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to Aaron and his sons and all the people\
      \ of Israel. This is what the Lord has commanded. \n"
    3: '³ “If any native Israelite sacrifices a bull or a lamb or a goat anywhere
      inside or outside the camp '
    4: '⁴ instead of bringing it to the entrance of the Tabernacle to present it as
      an offering to the Lord, that person will be as guilty as a murderer. Such a
      person has shed blood and will be cut off from the community. '
    5: '⁵ The purpose of this rule is to stop the Israelites from sacrificing animals
      in the open fields. It will ensure that they bring their sacrifices to the priest
      at the entrance of the Tabernacle, so he can present them to the Lord as peace
      offerings. '
    6: '⁶ Then the priest will be able to splatter the blood against the Lord’s altar
      at the entrance of the Tabernacle, and he will burn the fat as a pleasing aroma
      to the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices\
      \ to the goat idols. This is a permanent law for them, to be observed from generation\
      \ to generation. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Give them this command as well. If any native Israelite or foreigner living
      among you offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice '
    9: "⁹ but does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle to offer it to the\
      \ Lord, that person will be cut off from the community. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “And if any native Israelite or foreigner living among you eats or drinks
      blood in any form, I will turn against that person and cut him off from the
      community of your people, '
    11: '¹¹ for the life of the body is in its blood. I have given you the blood on
      the altar to purify you, making you right with the Lord. It is the blood, given
      in exchange for a life, that makes purification possible. '
    12: "¹² That is why I have said to the people of Israel, ‘You must never eat or\
      \ drink blood—neither you nor the foreigners living among you.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “And if any native Israelite or foreigner living among you goes hunting
      and kills an animal or bird that is approved for eating, he must drain its blood
      and cover it with earth. '
    14: "¹⁴ The life of every creature is in its blood. That is why I have said to\
      \ the people of Israel, ‘You must never eat or drink blood, for the life of\
      \ any creature is in its blood.’ So whoever consumes blood will be cut off from\
      \ the community. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “And if any native-born Israelites or foreigners eat the meat of an animal
      that died naturally or was torn up by wild animals, they must wash their clothes
      and bathe themselves in water. They will remain ceremonially unclean until evening,
      but then they will be clean. '
    16: ¹⁶ But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves, they will be
      punished for their sin.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. I am the Lord
      your God. '
    3: '³ So do not act like the people in Egypt, where you used to live, or like
      the people of Canaan, where I am taking you. You must not imitate their way

      \ it, she and the animal must both be put to death. You must kill both, for\
      \ they are guilty of a capital offense. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his\
      \ mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a shameful disgrace. They must\
      \ be publicly cut off from the community. Since the man has violated his sister,\
      \ he will be punished for his sin. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her menstrual period,\
      \ both of them must be cut off from the community, for together they have exposed\
      \ the source of her blood flow. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Do not have sexual relations with your aunt, whether your mother’s sister\
      \ or your father’s sister. This would dishonor a close relative. Both parties\
      \ are guilty and will be punished for their sin. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “If a man has sex with his uncle’s wife, he has violated his uncle. Both\
      \ the man and woman will be punished for their sin, and they will die childless.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ “If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is an act of impurity. He has\
      \ violated his brother, and the guilty couple will remain childless. \n"
    22: '²² “You must keep all my decrees and regulations by putting them into practice;
      otherwise the land to which I am bringing you as your new home will vomit you
      out. '
    23: '²³ Do not live according to the customs of the people I am driving out before
      you. It is because they do these shameful things that I detest them. '
    24: "²⁴ But I have promised you, ‘You will possess their land because I will give\
      \ it to you as your possession—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ I am the\
      \ Lord your God, who has set you apart from all other people. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “You must therefore make a distinction between ceremonially clean and
      unclean animals, and between clean and unclean birds. You must not defile yourselves
      by eating any unclean animal or bird or creature that scurries along the ground.
      I have identified them as being unclean for you. '
    26: "²⁶ You must be holy because I, the Lord, am holy. I have set you apart from\
      \ all other people to be my very own. \n"
    27: ²⁷ “Men and women among you who act as mediums or who consult the spirits
      of the dead must be put to death by stoning. They are guilty of a capital offense.”
  21:
    1: "¹ The Lord said to Moses, “Give the following instructions to the priests,\
      \ the descendants of Aaron.\n“A priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean\
      \ by touching the dead body of a relative. "
    2: '² The only exceptions are his closest relatives—his mother or father, son
      or daughter, brother, '
    3: '³ or his virgin sister who depends on him because she has no husband. '
    4: "⁴ But a priest must not defile himself and make himself unclean for someone\
      \ who is related to him only by marriage. \n"
    5: '⁵ “The priests must not shave their heads or trim their beards or cut their
      bodies. '
    6: "⁶ They must be set apart as holy to their God and must never bring shame on\
      \ the name of God. They must be holy, for they are the ones who present the\
      \ special gifts to the Lord, gifts of food for their God. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Priests may not marry a woman defiled by prostitution, and they may not
      marry a woman who is divorced from her husband, for the priests are set apart
      as holy to their God. '
    8: "⁸ You must treat them as holy because they offer up food to your God. You\
      \ must consider them holy because I, the Lord, am holy, and I make you holy.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ “If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she also\
      \ defiles her father’s holiness, and she must be burned to death. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “The high priest has the highest rank of all the priests. The anointing
      oil has been poured on his head, and he has been ordained to wear the priestly
      garments. He must never leave his hair uncombed or tear his clothing. '
    11: '¹¹ He must not defile himself by going near a dead body. He may not make
      himself ceremonially unclean even for his father or mother. '
    12: "¹² He must not defile the sanctuary of his God by leaving it to attend to\
      \ a dead person, for he has been made holy by the anointing oil of his God.\
      \ I am the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ “The high priest may marry only a virgin. '
    14: '¹⁴ He may not marry a widow, a woman who is divorced, or a woman who has
      defiled herself by prostitution. She must be a virgin from his own clan, '
    15: "¹⁵ so that he will not dishonor his descendants among his clan, for I am\
      \ the Lord who makes him holy.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Give the following instructions to Aaron: In all future generations,
      none of your descendants who has any defect will qualify to offer food to his
      God. '
    18: '¹⁸ No one who has a defect qualifies, whether he is blind, lame, disfigured,
      deformed, '
    19: '¹⁹ or has a broken foot or arm, '
    20: '²⁰ or is hunchbacked or dwarfed, or has a defective eye, or skin sores or
      scabs, or damaged testicles. '
    21: '²¹ No descendant of Aaron who has a defect may approach the altar to present
      special gifts to the Lord. Since he has a defect, he may not approach the altar
      to offer food to his God. '
    22: '²² However, he may eat from the food offered to God, including the holy offerings
      and the most holy offerings. '
    23: "²³ Yet because of his physical defect, he may not enter the room behind the\
      \ inner curtain or approach the altar, for this would defile my holy places.\
      \ I am the Lord who makes them holy.” \n"
    24: ²⁴ So Moses gave these instructions to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
  22:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Tell Aaron and his sons to be very careful with the sacred gifts that the
      Israelites set apart for me, so they do not bring shame on my holy name. I am
      the Lord. '
    3: "³ Give them the following instructions.\n“In all future generations, if any\
      \ of your descendants is ceremonially unclean when he approaches the sacred\
      \ offerings that the people of Israel consecrate to the Lord, he must be cut\
      \ off from my presence. I am the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ “If any of Aaron’s descendants has a skin disease or any kind of discharge
      that makes him ceremonially unclean, he may not eat from the sacred offerings
      until he has been pronounced clean. He also becomes unclean by touching a corpse,
      or by having an emission of semen, '
    5: '⁵ or by touching a small animal that is unclean, or by touching someone who
      is ceremonially unclean for any reason. '
    6: '⁶ The man who is defiled in any of these ways will remain unclean until evening.
      He may not eat from the sacred offerings until he has bathed himself in water. '
    7: '⁷ When the sun goes down, he will be ceremonially clean again and may eat
      from the sacred offerings, for this is his food. '
    8: "⁸ He may not eat an animal that has died a natural death or has been torn\
      \ apart by wild animals, for this would defile him. I am the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “The priests must follow my instructions carefully. Otherwise they will\
      \ be punished for their sin and will die for violating my instructions. I am\
      \ the Lord who makes them holy. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offerings. Even guests
      and hired workers in a priest’s home are not allowed to eat them. '
    11: '¹¹ However, if the priest buys a slave for himself, the slave may eat from
      the sacred offerings. And if his slaves have children, they also may share his
      food. '
    12: '¹² If a priest’s daughter marries someone outside the priestly family, she
      may no longer eat the sacred offerings. '
    13: "¹³ But if she becomes a widow or is divorced and has no children to support\
      \ her, and she returns to live in her father’s home as in her youth, she may\
      \ eat her father’s food again. Otherwise, no one outside a priest’s family may\
      \ eat the sacred offerings. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Any such person who eats the sacred offerings without realizing it must
      pay the priest for the amount eaten, plus an additional 20 percent. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priests must not let the Israelites defile the sacred offerings brought
      to the Lord '
    16: "¹⁶ by allowing unauthorized people to eat them. This would bring guilt upon\
      \ them and require them to pay compensation. I am the Lord who makes them holy.”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Give Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites these instructions, which\
      \ apply both to native Israelites and to the foreigners living among you.\n\
      “If you present a gift as a burnt offering to the Lord, whether it is to fulfill\
      \ a vow or is a voluntary offering, "
    19: '¹⁹ you will be accepted only if your offering is a male animal with no defects.
      It may be a bull, a ram, or a male goat. '
    20: "²⁰ Do not present an animal with defects, because the Lord will not accept\
      \ it on your behalf. \n"
    21: '²¹ “If you present a peace offering to the Lord from the herd or the flock,
      whether it is to fulfill a vow or is a voluntary offering, you must offer a
      perfect animal. It may have no defect of any kind. '
    22: '²² You must not offer an animal that is blind, crippled, or injured, or that
      has a wart, a skin sore, or scabs. Such animals must never be offered on the
      altar as special gifts to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ If a bull or lamb has a leg that is too long or too short, it may be offered
      as a voluntary offering, but it may not be offered to fulfill a vow. '
    24: '²⁴ If an animal has damaged testicles or is castrated, you may not offer
      it to the Lord. You must never do this in your own land, '
    25: "²⁵ and you must not accept such an animal from foreigners and then offer\
      \ it as a sacrifice to your God. Such animals will not be accepted on your behalf,\
      \ for they are mutilated or defective.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    27: '²⁷ “When a calf or lamb or goat is born, it must be left with its mother
      for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a special gift
      to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ But you must not slaughter a mother animal and her offspring on the same
      day, whether from the herd or the flock. '
    29: '²⁹ When you bring a thanksgiving offering to the Lord, sacrifice it properly
      so you will be accepted. '
    30: "³⁰ Eat the entire sacrificial animal on the day it is presented. Do not leave\
      \ any of it until the next morning. I am the Lord. \n"
    31: '³¹ “You must faithfully keep all my commands by putting them into practice,
      for I am the Lord. '
    32: '³² Do not bring shame on my holy name, for I will display my holiness among
      the people of Israel. I am the Lord who makes you holy. '
    33: ³³ It was I who rescued you from the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.
      I am the Lord.”
  23:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. These are the\
      \ Lord’s appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as official days for\
      \ holy assembly. \n"
    3: "³ “You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day\
      \ is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is\
      \ the Lord’s Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live. \n"
    4: "⁴ “In addition to the Sabbath, these are the Lord’s appointed festivals, the\
      \ official days for holy assembly that are to be celebrated at their proper\
      \ times each year. \n"
    5: '⁵ “The Lord’s Passover begins at sundown on the fourteenth day of the first
      month. '
    6: '⁶ On the next day, the fifteenth day of the month, you must begin celebrating
      the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This festival to the Lord continues for seven
      days, and during that time the bread you eat must be made without yeast. '
    7: '⁷ On the first day of the festival, all the people must stop their ordinary
      work and observe an official day for holy assembly. '
    8: "⁸ For seven days you must present special gifts to the Lord. On the seventh\
      \ day the people must again stop all their ordinary work to observe an official\
      \ day for holy assembly.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you enter
      the land I am giving you and you harvest its first crops, bring the priest a
      bundle of grain from the first cutting of your grain harvest. '
    11: '¹¹ On the day after the Sabbath, the priest will lift it up before the Lord
      so it may be accepted on your behalf. '
    12: '¹² On that same day you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb with no defects
      as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ With it you must present a grain offering consisting of four quarts of
      choice flour moistened with olive oil. It will be a special gift, a pleasing
      aroma to the Lord. You must also offer one quart of wine as a liquid offering. '
    14: "¹⁴ Do not eat any bread or roasted grain or fresh kernels on that day until\
      \ you bring this offering to your God. This is a permanent law for you, and\
      \ it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “From the day after the Sabbath—the day you bring the bundle of grain
      to be lifted up as a special offering—count off seven full weeks. '
    16: '¹⁶ Keep counting until the day after the seventh Sabbath, fifty days later.
      Then present an offering of new grain to the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ From wherever you live, bring two loaves of bread to be lifted up before
      the Lord as a special offering. Make these loaves from four quarts of choice
      flour, and bake them with yeast. They will be an offering to the Lord from the
      first of your crops. '
    18: '¹⁸ Along with the bread, present seven one-year-old male lambs with no defects,
      one young bull, and two rams as burnt offerings to the Lord. These burnt offerings,
      together with the grain offerings and liquid offerings, will be a special gift,
      a pleasing aroma to the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then you must offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old\
      \ male lambs as a peace offering. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “The priest will lift up the two lambs as a special offering to the Lord,
      together with the loaves representing the first of your crops. These offerings,
      which are holy to the Lord, belong to the priests. '
    21: "²¹ That same day will be proclaimed an official day for holy assembly, a\
      \ day on which you do no ordinary work. This is a permanent law for you, and\
      \ it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live. \n"
    22: "²² “When you harvest the crops of your land, do not harvest the grain along\
      \ the edges of your fields, and do not pick up what the harvesters drop. Leave\
      \ it for the poor and the foreigners living among you. I am the Lord your God.”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ The Lord said to Moses, '
    24: '²⁴ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. On the first
      day of the appointed month in early autumn, you are to observe a day of complete
      rest. It will be an official day for holy assembly, a day commemorated with
      loud blasts of a trumpet. '
    25: "²⁵ You must do no ordinary work on that day. Instead, you are to present\
      \ special gifts to the Lord.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    27: '²⁷ “Be careful to celebrate the Day of Atonement on the tenth day of that
      same month—nine days after the Festival of Trumpets. You must observe it as
      an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves and present special
      gifts to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Do no work during that entire day because it is the Day of Atonement,
      when offerings of purification are made for you, making you right with the Lord
      your God. '
    29: '²⁹ All who do not deny themselves that day will be cut off from God’s people. '
    30: '³⁰ And I will destroy anyone among you who does any work on that day. '
    31: '³¹ You must not do any work at all! This is a permanent law for you, and
      it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live. '
    32: "³² This will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you, and on that day you\
      \ must deny yourselves. This day of rest will begin at sundown on the ninth\
      \ day of the month and extend until sundown on the tenth day.” \n"
    33: '³³ And the Lord said to Moses, '
    34: '³⁴ “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Begin celebrating
      the Festival of Shelters on the fifteenth day of the appointed month—five days
      after the Day of Atonement. This festival to the Lord will last for seven days. '
    35: '³⁵ On the first day of the festival you must proclaim an official day for
      holy assembly, when you do no ordinary work. '
    36: "³⁶ For seven days you must present special gifts to the Lord. The eighth\
      \ day is another holy day on which you present your special gifts to the Lord.\
      \ This will be a solemn occasion, and no ordinary work may be done that day.\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ (“These are the Lord’s appointed festivals. Celebrate them each year as
      official days for holy assembly by presenting special gifts to the Lord—burnt
      offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices, and liquid offerings—each on its proper
      day. '
    38: "³⁸ These festivals must be observed in addition to the Lord’s regular Sabbath\
      \ days, and the offerings are in addition to your personal gifts, the offerings\
      \ you give to fulfill your vows, and the voluntary offerings you present to\
      \ the Lord.) \n"
    39: '³⁹ “Remember that this seven-day festival to the Lord—the Festival of Shelters—begins
      on the fifteenth day of the appointed month, after you have harvested all the
      produce of the land. The first day and the eighth day of the festival will be
      days of complete rest. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On the first day gather branches from magnificent trees—palm fronds, boughs
      from leafy trees, and willows that grow by the streams. Then celebrate with
      joy before the Lord your God for seven days. '
    41: '⁴¹ You must observe this festival to the Lord for seven days every year.
      This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed in the appointed month
      from generation to generation. '
    42: '⁴² For seven days you must live outside in little shelters. All native-born
      Israelites must live in shelters. '
    43: "⁴³ This will remind each new generation of Israelites that I made their ancestors\
      \ live in shelters when I rescued them from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord\
      \ your God.” \n"
    44: ⁴⁴ So Moses gave the Israelites these instructions regarding the annual festivals
      of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for
      the light, to keep the lamps burning continually. '
    3: '³ This is the lampstand that stands in the Tabernacle, in front of the inner
      curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant. Aaron must keep the lamps burning
      in the Lord’s presence all night. This is a permanent law for you, and it must
      be observed from generation to generation. '
    4: "⁴ Aaron and the priests must tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand continually\
      \ in the Lord’s presence. \n"
    5: '⁵ “You must bake twelve flat loaves of bread from choice flour, using four
      quarts of flour for each loaf. '
    6: '⁶ Place the bread before the Lord on the pure gold table, and arrange the
      loaves in two stacks, with six loaves in each stack. '
    7: '⁷ Put some pure frankincense near each stack to serve as a representative
      offering, a special gift presented to the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Every Sabbath day this bread must be laid out before the Lord as a gift
      from the Israelites; it is an ongoing expression of the eternal covenant. '
    9: "⁹ The loaves of bread will belong to Aaron and his descendants, who must eat\
      \ them in a sacred place, for they are most holy. It is the permanent right\
      \ of the priests to claim this portion of the special gifts presented to the\
      \ Lord.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father came
      out of his tent and got into a fight with one of the Israelite men. '
    11: '¹¹ During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the Name of
      the Lord with a curse. So the man was brought to Moses for judgment. His mother
      was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan. '
    12: "¹² They kept the man in custody until the Lord’s will in the matter should\
      \ become clear to them. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    14: '¹⁴ “Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard the
      curse to lay their hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him
      to death. '
    15: '¹⁵ Say to the people of Israel: Those who curse their God will be punished
      for their sin. '
    16: "¹⁶ Anyone who blasphemes the Name of the Lord must be stoned to death by\
      \ the whole community of Israel. Any native-born Israelite or foreigner among\
      \ you who blasphemes the Name of the Lord must be put to death. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Anyone who takes another person’s life must be put to death. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Anyone who kills another person’s animal must pay for it in full—a live\
      \ animal for the animal that was killed. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Anyone who injures another person must be dealt with according to the
      injury inflicted— '
    20: "²⁰ a fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Whatever\
      \ anyone does to injure another person must be paid back in kind. \n"
    21: "²¹ “Whoever kills an animal must pay for it in full, but whoever kills another\
      \ person must be put to death. \n"
    22: "²² “This same standard applies both to native-born Israelites and to the\
      \ foreigners living among you. I am the Lord your God.” \n"
    23: ²³ After Moses gave all these instructions to the Israelites, they took the
      blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death. The Israelites did just
      as the Lord had commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: '¹ While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the Lord said to him, '
    2: '² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you have
      entered the land I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath rest
      before the Lord every seventh year. '
    3: '³ For six years you may plant your fields and prune your vineyards and harvest
      your crops, '
    4: '⁴ but during the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath year of complete
      rest. It is the Lord’s Sabbath. Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards
      during that year. '
    5: '⁵ And don’t store away the crops that grow on their own or gather the grapes
      from your unpruned vines. The land must have a year of complete rest. '
    6: '⁶ But you may eat whatever the land produces on its own during its Sabbath.
      This applies to you, your male and female servants, your hired workers, and
      the temporary residents who live with you. '
    7: "⁷ Your livestock and the wild animals in your land will also be allowed to\
      \ eat what the land produces. \n"
    8: '⁸ “In addition, you must count off seven Sabbath years, seven sets of seven
      years, adding up to forty-nine years in all. '
    9: '⁹ Then on the Day of Atonement in the fiftieth year, blow the ram’s horn loud
      and long throughout the land. '
    10: '¹⁰ Set this year apart as holy, a time to proclaim freedom throughout the
      land for all who live there. It will be a jubilee year for you, when each of
      you may return to the land that belonged to your ancestors and return to your
      own clan. '
    11: '¹¹ This fiftieth year will be a jubilee for you. During that year you must
      not plant your fields or store away any of the crops that grow on their own,
      and don’t gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. '
    12: '¹² It will be a jubilee year for you, and you must keep it holy. But you
      may eat whatever the land produces on its own. '
    13: "¹³ In the Year of Jubilee each of you may return to the land that belonged\
      \ to your ancestors. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “When you make an agreement with your neighbor to buy or sell property,
      you must not take advantage of each other. '
    15: '¹⁵ When you buy land from your neighbor, the price you pay must be based
      on the number of years since the last jubilee. The seller must set the price
      by taking into account the number of years remaining until the next Year of
      Jubilee. '
    16: '¹⁶ The more years until the next jubilee, the higher the price; the fewer
      years, the lower the price. After all, the person selling the land is actually
      selling you a certain number of harvests. '
    17: "¹⁷ Show your fear of God by not taking advantage of each other. I am the\
      \ Lord your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “If you want to live securely in the land, follow my decrees and obey
      my regulations. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the land will yield large crops, and you will eat your fill and live
      securely in it. '
    20: '²⁰ But you might ask, ‘What will we eat during the seventh year, since we
      are not allowed to plant or harvest crops that year?’ '
    21: '²¹ Be assured that I will send my blessing for you in the sixth year, so
      the land will produce a crop large enough for three years. '
    22: "²² When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating\
      \ from the large crop of the sixth year. In fact, you will still be eating from\
      \ that large crop when the new crop is harvested in the ninth year. \n"
    23: "²³ “The land must never be sold on a permanent basis, for the land belongs\
      \ to me. You are only foreigners and tenant farmers working for me. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “With every purchase of land you must grant the seller the right to buy
      it back. '
    25: '²⁵ If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to sell
      some family land, then a close relative should buy it back for him. '
    26: '²⁶ If there is no close relative to buy the land, but the person who sold
      it gets enough money to buy it back, '
    27: '²⁷ he then has the right to redeem it from the one who bought it. The price
      of the land will be discounted according to the number of years until the next
      Year of Jubilee. In this way the original owner can then return to the land. '
    28: "²⁸ But if the original owner cannot afford to buy back the land, it will\
      \ remain with the new owner until the next Year of Jubilee. In the jubilee year,\
      \ the land must be returned to the original owners so they can return to their\
      \ family land. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Anyone who sells a house inside a walled town has the right to buy it
      back for a full year after its sale. During that year, the seller retains the
      right to buy it back. '
    30: '³⁰ But if it is not bought back within a year, the sale of the house within
      the walled town cannot be reversed. It will become the permanent property of
      the buyer. It will not be returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee. '
    31: "³¹ But a house in a village—a settlement without fortified walls—will be\
      \ treated like property in the countryside. Such a house may be bought back\
      \ at any time, and it must be returned to the original owner in the Year of\
      \ Jubilee. \n"
    32: '³² “The Levites always have the right to buy back a house they have sold
      within the towns allotted to them. '
    33: '³³ And any property that is sold by the Levites—all houses within the Levitical
      towns—must be returned in the Year of Jubilee. After all, the houses in the
      towns reserved for the Levites are the only property they own in all Israel. '
    34: "³⁴ The open pastureland around the Levitical towns may never be sold. It\
      \ is their permanent possession. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and cannot support
      himself, support him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident and allow
      him to live with you. '
    36: '³⁶ Do not charge interest or make a profit at his expense. Instead, show
      your fear of God by letting him live with you as your relative. '
    37: '³⁷ Remember, do not charge interest on money you lend him or make a profit
      on food you sell him. '
    38: "³⁸ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give\
      \ you the land of Canaan and to be your God. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to
      sell himself to you, do not treat him as a slave. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Treat him instead as a hired worker or as a temporary resident who lives
      with you, and he will serve you only until the Year of Jubilee. '
    41: '⁴¹ At that time he and his children will no longer be obligated to you, and
      they will return to their clans and go back to the land originally allotted
      to their ancestors. '
    42: '⁴² The people of Israel are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of
      Egypt, so they must never be sold as slaves. '
    43: "⁴³ Show your fear of God by not treating them harshly. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “However, you may purchase male and female slaves from among the nations
      around you. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You may also purchase the children of temporary residents who live among
      you, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as
      your property, '
    46: "⁴⁶ passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat\
      \ them as slaves, but you must never treat your fellow Israelites this way.\
      \ \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ “Suppose a foreigner or temporary resident becomes rich while living among
      you. If any of your fellow Israelites fall into poverty and are forced to sell
      themselves to such a foreigner or to a member of his family, '
    48: '⁴⁸ they still retain the right to be bought back, even after they have been
      purchased. They may be bought back by a brother, '
    49: '⁴⁹ an uncle, or a cousin. In fact, anyone from the extended family may buy
      them back. They may also redeem themselves if they have prospered. '
    50: '⁵⁰ They will negotiate the price of their freedom with the person who bought
      them. The price will be based on the number of years from the time they were
      sold until the next Year of Jubilee—whatever it would cost to hire a worker
      for that period of time. '
    51: '⁵¹ If many years still remain until the jubilee, they will repay the proper
      proportion of what they received when they sold themselves. '
    52: '⁵² If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they will repay
      a small amount for their redemption. '
    53: '⁵³ The foreigner must treat them as workers hired on a yearly basis. You
      must not allow a foreigner to treat any of your fellow Israelites harshly. '
    54: '⁵⁴ If any Israelites have not been bought back by the time the Year of Jubilee
      arrives, they and their children must be set free at that time. '
    55: ⁵⁵ For the people of Israel belong to me. They are my servants, whom I brought
      out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
  26:
    1: '¹ “Do not make idols or set up carved images, or sacred pillars, or sculptured
      stones in your land so you may worship them. I am the Lord your God. '
    2: "² You must keep my Sabbath days of rest and show reverence for my sanctuary.\
      \ I am the Lord. \n"
    3: '³ “If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, '
    4: '⁴ I will send you the seasonal rains. The land will then yield its crops,
      and the trees of the field will produce their fruit. '
    5: "⁵ Your threshing season will overlap with the grape harvest, and your grape\
      \ harvest will overlap with the season of planting grain. You will eat your\
      \ fill and live securely in your own land. \n"
    6: '⁶ “I will give you peace in the land, and you will be able to sleep with no
      cause for fear. I will rid the land of wild animals and keep your enemies out
      of your land. '
    7: '⁷ In fact, you will chase down your enemies and slaughter them with your swords. '
    8: "⁸ Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand!\
      \ All your enemies will fall beneath your sword. \n"
    9: '⁹ “I will look favorably upon you, making you fertile and multiplying your
      people. And I will fulfill my covenant with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You will have such a surplus of crops that you will need to clear out
      the old grain to make room for the new harvest! '
    11: '¹¹ I will live among you, and I will not despise you. '
    12: '¹² I will walk among you; I will be your God, and you will be my people. '
    13: "¹³ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so you\
      \ would no longer be their slaves. I broke the yoke of slavery from your neck\
      \ so you can walk with your heads held high. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “However, if you do not listen to me or obey all these commands, '
    15: '¹⁵ and if you break my covenant by rejecting my decrees, treating my regulations
      with contempt, and refusing to obey my commands, '
    16: '¹⁶ I will punish you. I will bring sudden terrors upon you—wasting diseases
      and burning fevers that will cause your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away.
      You will plant your crops in vain because your enemies will eat them. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will turn against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. Those\
      \ who hate you will rule over you, and you will run even when no one is chasing\
      \ you! \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “And if, in spite of all this, you still disobey me, I will punish you
      seven times over for your sins. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will break your proud spirit by making the skies as unyielding as iron
      and the earth as hard as bronze. '
    20: "²⁰ All your work will be for nothing, for your land will yield no crops,\
      \ and your trees will bear no fruit. \n"
    21: '²¹ “If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey me, I will
      inflict disaster on you seven times over for your sins. '
    22: "²² I will send wild animals that will rob you of your children and destroy\
      \ your livestock. Your numbers will dwindle, and your roads will be deserted.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “And if you fail to learn the lesson and continue your hostility toward
      me, '
    24: '²⁴ then I myself will be hostile toward you. I will personally strike you
      with calamity seven times over for your sins. '
    25: '²⁵ I will send armies against you to carry out the curse of the covenant
      you have broken. When you run to your towns for safety, I will send a plague
      to destroy you there, and you will be handed over to your enemies. '
    26: "²⁶ I will destroy your food supply, so that ten women will need only one\
      \ oven to bake bread for their families. They will ration your food by weight,\
      \ and though you have food to eat, you will not be satisfied. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “If in spite of all this you still refuse to listen and still remain hostile
      toward me, '
    28: '²⁸ then I will give full vent to my hostility. I myself will punish you seven
      times over for your sins. '
    29: '²⁹ Then you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters. '
    30: '³⁰ I will destroy your pagan shrines and knock down your places of worship.
      I will leave your lifeless corpses piled on top of your lifeless idols, and
      I will despise you. '
    31: '³¹ I will make your cities desolate and destroy your places of pagan worship.
      I will take no pleasure in your offerings that should be a pleasing aroma to
      me. '
    32: '³² Yes, I myself will devastate your land, and your enemies who come to occupy
      it will be appalled at what they see. '
    33: '³³ I will scatter you among the nations and bring out my sword against you.
      Your land will become desolate, and your cities will lie in ruins. '
    34: '³⁴ Then at last the land will enjoy its neglected Sabbath years as it lies
      desolate while you are in exile in the land of your enemies. Then the land will
      finally rest and enjoy the Sabbaths it missed. '
    35: "³⁵ As long as the land lies in ruins, it will enjoy the rest you never allowed\
      \ it to take every seventh year while you lived in it. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “And for those of you who survive, I will demoralize you in the land of
      your enemies. You will live in such fear that the sound of a leaf driven by
      the wind will send you fleeing. You will run as though fleeing from a sword,
      and you will fall even when no one pursues you. '
    37: '³⁷ Though no one is chasing you, you will stumble over each other as though
      fleeing from a sword. You will have no power to stand up against your enemies. '
    38: '³⁸ You will die among the foreign nations and be devoured in the land of
      your enemies. '
    39: "³⁹ Those of you who survive will waste away in your enemies’ lands because\
      \ of their sins and the sins of their ancestors. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “But at last my people will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors
      for betraying me and being hostile toward me. '
    41: '⁴¹ When I have turned their hostility back on them and brought them to the
      land of their enemies, then at last their stubborn hearts will be humbled, and
      they will pay for their sins. '
    42: '⁴² Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac
      and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. '
    43: "⁴³ For the land must be abandoned to enjoy its years of Sabbath rest as it\
      \ lies deserted. At last the people will pay for their sins, for they have continually\
      \ rejected my regulations and despised my decrees. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “But despite all this, I will not utterly reject or despise them while
      they are in exile in the land of their enemies. I will not cancel my covenant
      with them by wiping them out, for I am the Lord their God. '
    45: "⁴⁵ For their sakes I will remember my ancient covenant with their ancestors,\
      \ whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of all the nations, that\
      \ I might be their God. I am the Lord.” \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ These are the decrees, regulations, and instructions that the Lord gave
      through Moses on Mount Sinai as evidence of the relationship between himself
      and the Israelites.
  27:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. If anyone makes
      a special vow to dedicate someone to the Lord by paying the value of that person, '
    3: '³ here is the scale of values to be used. A man between the ages of twenty
      and sixty is valued at fifty shekels of silver, as measured by the sanctuary
      shekel. '
    4: '⁴ A woman of that age is valued at thirty shekels of silver. '
    5: '⁵ A boy between the ages of five and twenty is valued at twenty shekels of
      silver; a girl of that age is valued at ten shekels of silver. '
    6: '⁶ A boy between the ages of one month and five years is valued at five shekels
      of silver; a girl of that age is valued at three shekels of silver. '
    7: '⁷ A man older than sixty is valued at fifteen shekels of silver; a woman of
      that age is valued at ten shekels of silver. '
    8: "⁸ If you desire to make such a vow but cannot afford to pay the required amount,\
      \ take the person to the priest. He will determine the amount for you to pay\
      \ based on what you can afford. \n"
    9: '⁹ “If your vow involves giving an animal that is acceptable as an offering
      to the Lord, any gift to the Lord will be considered holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ You may not exchange or substitute it for another animal—neither a good
      animal for a bad one nor a bad animal for a good one. But if you do exchange
      one animal for another, then both the original animal and its substitute will
      be considered holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If your vow involves an unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an
      offering to the Lord—then you must bring the animal to the priest. '
    12: '¹² He will assess its value, and his assessment will be final, whether high
      or low. '
    13: "¹³ If you want to buy back the animal, you must pay the value set by the\
      \ priest, plus 20 percent. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “If someone dedicates a house to the Lord, the priest will come to assess
      its value. The priest’s assessment will be final, whether high or low. '
    15: "¹⁵ If the person who dedicated the house wants to buy it back, he must pay\
      \ the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent. Then the house will again be\
      \ his. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “If someone dedicates to the Lord a piece of his family property, its
      value will be assessed according to the amount of seed required to plant it—fifty
      shekels of silver for a field planted with five bushels of barley seed. '
    17: '¹⁷ If the field is dedicated to the Lord in the Year of Jubilee, then the
      entire assessment will apply. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if the field is dedicated after the Year of Jubilee, the priest will
      assess the land’s value in proportion to the number of years left until the
      next Year of Jubilee. Its assessed value is reduced each year. '
    19: '¹⁹ If the person who dedicated the field wants to buy it back, he must pay
      the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent. Then the field will again be legally
      his. '
    20: '²⁰ But if he does not want to buy it back, and it is sold to someone else,
      the field can no longer be bought back. '
    21: "²¹ When the field is released in the Year of Jubilee, it will be holy, a\
      \ field specially set apart for the Lord. It will become the property of the\
      \ priests. \n"
    22: '²² “If someone dedicates to the Lord a field he has purchased but which is
      not part of his family property, '
    23: '²³ the priest will assess its value based on the number of years left until
      the next Year of Jubilee. On that day he must give the assessed value of the
      land as a sacred donation to the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ In the Year of Jubilee the field must be returned to the person from whom
      he purchased it, the one who inherited it as family property. '
    25: "²⁵ (All the payments must be measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel,\
      \ which equals twenty gerahs.) \n"
    26: '²⁶ “You may not dedicate a firstborn animal to the Lord, for the firstborn
      of your cattle, sheep, and goats already belong to him. '
    27: "²⁷ However, you may buy back the firstborn of a ceremonially unclean animal\
      \ by paying the priest’s assessment of its worth, plus 20 percent. If you do\
      \ not buy it back, the priest will sell it at its assessed value. \n"
    28: '²⁸ “However, anything specially set apart for the Lord—whether a person,
      an animal, or family property—must never be sold or bought back. Anything devoted
      in this way has been set apart as holy, and it belongs to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ No person specially set apart for destruction may be bought back. Such\
      \ a person must be put to death. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “One-tenth of the produce of the land, whether grain from the fields or
      fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord and must be set apart to him as holy. '
    31: '³¹ If you want to buy back the Lord’s tenth of the grain or fruit, you must
      pay its value, plus 20 percent. '
    32: '³² Count off every tenth animal from your herds and flocks and set them apart
      for the Lord as holy. '
    33: "³³ You may not pick and choose between good and bad animals, and you may\
      \ not substitute one for another. But if you do exchange one animal for another,\
      \ then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy and\
      \ cannot be bought back.” \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commands that the Lord gave through Moses on Mount Sinai
      for the Israelites.
