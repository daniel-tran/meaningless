3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. \n"
    2: '² Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good
      health, as it goes well with your soul. '
    3: '³ For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth,
      as indeed you are walking in the truth. '
    4: "⁴ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers,
      strangers as they are, '
    6: '⁶ who testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them
      on their journey in a manner worthy of God. '
    7: '⁷ For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from
      the Gentiles. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers\
      \ for the truth. \n"
    9: '⁹ I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put
      himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. '
    10: "¹⁰ So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense\
      \ against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers,\
      \ and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from
      God; whoever does evil has not seen God. '
    12: "¹² Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth\
      \ itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and
      ink. '
    14: "¹⁴ I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, each by name.
