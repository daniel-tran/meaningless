Ezekiel:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month,
      as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and
      I saw visions of God. '
    2: '² On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King
      Jehoiachin), '
    3: "³ the word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land\
      \ of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was on him\
      \ there. \n"
    4: '⁴ As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with brightness
      around it and fire flashing forth continually, and in the middle of the fire,
      something like gleaming amber. '
    5: '⁵ In the middle of it was something like four living creatures. This was their
      appearance: they were of human form. '
    6: '⁶ Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. '
    7: '⁷ Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole
      of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. '
    8: '⁸ Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four
      had their faces and their wings thus: '
    9: '⁹ their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without
      turning as they moved. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human
      being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side,
      and the face of an eagle; '
    11: '¹¹ such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature
      had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered
      their bodies. '
    12: '¹² Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without
      turning as they went. '
    13: '¹³ In the middle of the living creatures there was something that looked
      like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living
      creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire. '
    14: "¹⁴ The living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside
      the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. '
    16: '¹⁶ As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance
      was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction
      being something like a wheel within a wheel. '
    17: '¹⁷ When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering
      as they moved. '
    18: '¹⁸ Their rims were tall and awesome, for the rims of all four were full of
      eyes all around. '
    19: '¹⁹ When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when
      the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. '
    20: '²⁰ Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with
      them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. '
    21: "²¹ When they moved, the others moved; when they stopped, the others stopped;\
      \ and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the\
      \ spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. \n"
    22: '²² Over the heads of the living creatures there was something like a dome,
      shining like crystal, spread out above their heads. '
    23: '²³ Under the dome their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another;
      and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body. '
    24: '²⁴ When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty
      waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of
      an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings. '
    25: "²⁵ And there came a voice from above the dome over their heads; when they\
      \ stopped, they let down their wings. \n"
    26: '²⁶ And above the dome over their heads there was something like a throne,
      in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was something
      that seemed like a human form. '
    27: '²⁷ Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming
      amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from
      what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there
      was a splendor all around. '
    28: "²⁸ Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the\
      \ splendor all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory\
      \ of the Lord.\nWhen I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of someone\
      \ speaking."
  2:
    1: '¹ He said to me: O mortal, stand up on your feet, and I will speak with you. '
    2: '² And when he spoke to me, a spirit entered into me and set me on my feet;
      and I heard him speaking to me. '
    3: '³ He said to me, Mortal, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation
      of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed
      against me to this very day. '
    4: '⁴ The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and
      you shall say to them, “Thus says the Lord God.” '
    5: '⁵ Whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house), they
      shall know that there has been a prophet among them. '
    6: '⁶ And you, O mortal, do not be afraid of them, and do not be afraid of their
      words, though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions; do
      not be afraid of their words, and do not be dismayed at their looks, for they
      are a rebellious house. '
    7: "⁷ You shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for\
      \ they are a rebellious house. \n"
    8: '⁸ But you, mortal, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that
      rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you. '
    9: '⁹ I looked, and a hand was stretched out to me, and a written scroll was in
      it. '
    10: ¹⁰ He spread it before me; it had writing on the front and on the back, and
      written on it were words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
  3:
    1: '¹ He said to me, O mortal, eat what is offered to you; eat this scroll, and
      go, speak to the house of Israel. '
    2: '² So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. '
    3: "³ He said to me, Mortal, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach\
      \ with it. Then I ate it; and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey. \n"
    4: '⁴ He said to me: Mortal, go to the house of Israel and speak my very words
      to them. '
    5: '⁵ For you are not sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language,
      but to the house of Israel— '
    6: '⁶ not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words
      you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. '
    7: '⁷ But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they are not willing
      to listen to me; because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a
      stubborn heart. '
    8: '⁸ See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard
      against their foreheads. '
    9: '⁹ Like the hardest stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do
      not fear them or be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. '
    10: '¹⁰ He said to me: Mortal, all my words that I shall speak to you receive
      in your heart and hear with your ears; '
    11: "¹¹ then go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them. Say to them,\
      \ “Thus says the Lord God”; whether they hear or refuse to hear. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the Lord rose from its
      place, I heard behind me the sound of loud rumbling; '
    13: '¹³ it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against
      one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a loud
      rumbling. '
    14: '¹⁴ The spirit lifted me up and bore me away; I went in bitterness in the
      heat of my spirit, the hand of the Lord being strong upon me. '
    15: "¹⁵ I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I\
      \ sat there among them, stunned, for seven days. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me: '
    17: '¹⁷ Mortal, I have made you a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you
      hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. '
    18: '¹⁸ If I say to the wicked, “You shall surely die,” and you give them no warning,
      or speak to warn the wicked from their wicked way, in order to save their life,
      those wicked persons shall die for their iniquity; but their blood I will require
      at your hand. '
    19: '¹⁹ But if you warn the wicked, and they do not turn from their wickedness,
      or from their wicked way, they shall die for their iniquity; but you will have
      saved your life. '
    20: '²⁰ Again, if the righteous turn from their righteousness and commit iniquity,
      and I lay a stumbling block before them, they shall die; because you have not
      warned them, they shall die for their sin, and their righteous deeds that they
      have done shall not be remembered; but their blood I will require at your hand. '
    21: "²¹ If, however, you warn the righteous not to sin, and they do not sin, they\
      \ shall surely live, because they took warning; and you will have saved your\
      \ life. \n"
    22: '²² Then the hand of the Lord was upon me there; and he said to me, Rise up,
      go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you. '
    23: '²³ So I rose up and went out into the valley; and the glory of the Lord stood
      there, like the glory that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my
      face. '
    24: '²⁴ The spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me
      and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house. '
    25: '²⁵ As for you, mortal, cords shall be placed on you, and you shall be bound
      with them, so that you cannot go out among the people; '
    26: '²⁶ and I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you
      shall be speechless and unable to reprove them; for they are a rebellious house. '
    27: ²⁷ But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to
      them, “Thus says the Lord God”; let those who will hear, hear; and let those
      who refuse to hear, refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
  4:
    1: '¹ And you, O mortal, take a brick and set it before you. On it portray a city,
      Jerusalem; '
    2: '² and put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast
      up a ramp against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against
      it all around. '
    3: "³ Then take an iron plate and place it as an iron wall between you and the\
      \ city; set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press\
      \ the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel
      upon it; you shall bear their punishment for the number of the days that you
      lie there. '
    5: '⁵ For I assign to you a number of days, three hundred ninety days, equal to
      the number of the years of their punishment; and so you shall bear the punishment
      of the house of Israel. '
    6: '⁶ When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on
      your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah; forty days I
      assign you, one day for each year. '
    7: '⁷ You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and with your arm
      bared you shall prophesy against it. '
    8: "⁸ See, I am putting cords on you so that you cannot turn from one side to\
      \ the other until you have completed the days of your siege. \n"
    9: '⁹ And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put
      them into one vessel, and make bread for yourself. During the number of days
      that you lie on your side, three hundred ninety days, you shall eat it. '
    10: '¹⁰ The food that you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; at fixed
      times you shall eat it. '
    11: '¹¹ And you shall drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; at fixed times
      you shall drink. '
    12: '¹² You shall eat it as a barley-cake, baking it in their sight on human dung. '
    13: '¹³ The Lord said, “Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread, unclean,
      among the nations to which I will drive them.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I said, “Ah Lord God! I have never defiled myself; from my youth
      up until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by animals,
      nor has carrion flesh come into my mouth.” '
    15: "¹⁵ Then he said to me, “See, I will let you have cow’s dung instead of human\
      \ dung, on which you may prepare your bread.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then he said to me, Mortal, I am going to break the staff of bread in
      Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness; and they shall
      drink water by measure and in dismay. '
    17: ¹⁷ Lacking bread and water, they will look at one another in dismay, and waste
      away under their punishment.
  5:
    1: '¹ And you, O mortal, take a sharp sword; use it as a barber’s razor and run
      it over your head and your beard; then take balances for weighing, and divide
      the hair. '
    2: '² One third of the hair you shall burn in the fire inside the city, when the
      days of the siege are completed; one third you shall take and strike with the
      sword all around the city; and one third you shall scatter to the wind, and
      I will unsheathe the sword after them. '
    3: '³ Then you shall take from these a small number, and bind them in the skirts
      of your robe. '
    4: "⁴ From these, again, you shall take some, throw them into the fire and burn\
      \ them up; from there a fire will come out against all the house of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center
      of the nations, with countries all around her. '
    6: '⁶ But she has rebelled against my ordinances and my statutes, becoming more
      wicked than the nations and the countries all around her, rejecting my ordinances
      and not following my statutes. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you are more turbulent than the
      nations that are all around you, and have not followed my statutes or kept my
      ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are
      all around you; '
    8: '⁸ therefore thus says the Lord God: I, I myself, am coming against you; I
      will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. '
    9: '⁹ And because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never
      yet done, and the like of which I will never do again. '
    10: '¹⁰ Surely, parents shall eat their children in your midst, and children shall
      eat their parents; I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive
      I will scatter to every wind. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, surely, because you have defiled
      my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations—therefore
      I will cut you down; my eye will not spare, and I will have no pity. '
    12: "¹² One third of you shall die of pestilence or be consumed by famine among\
      \ you; one third shall fall by the sword around you; and one third I will scatter\
      \ to every wind and will unsheathe the sword after them. \n"
    13: '¹³ My anger shall spend itself, and I will vent my fury on them and satisfy
      myself; and they shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken in my jealousy, when
      I spend my fury on them. '
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover I will make you a desolation and an object of mocking among the
      nations around you, in the sight of all that pass by. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall be a mockery and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations
      around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious
      punishments—I, the Lord, have spoken— '
    16: '¹⁶ when I loose against you my deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction,
      which I will let loose to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine
      upon you, and break your staff of bread. '
    17: ¹⁷ I will send famine and wild animals against you, and they will rob you
      of your children; pestilence and bloodshed shall pass through you; and I will
      bring the sword upon you. I, the Lord, have spoken.
  6:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² O mortal, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against
      them, '
    3: '³ and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says
      the Lord God to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys:
      I, I myself will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. '
    4: '⁴ Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense stands shall be broken;
      and I will throw down your slain in front of your idols. '
    5: '⁵ I will lay the corpses of the people of Israel in front of their idols;
      and I will scatter your bones around your altars. '
    6: '⁶ Wherever you live, your towns shall be waste and your high places ruined,
      so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed,
      your incense stands cut down, and your works wiped out. '
    7: "⁷ The slain shall fall in your midst; then you shall know that I am the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ But I will spare some. Some of you shall escape the sword among the nations
      and be scattered through the countries. '
    9: '⁹ Those of you who escape shall remember me among the nations where they are
      carried captive, how I was crushed by their wanton heart that turned away from
      me, and their wanton eyes that turned after their idols. Then they will be loathsome
      in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations. '
    10: "¹⁰ And they shall know that I am the Lord; I did not threaten in vain to\
      \ bring this disaster upon them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Thus says the Lord God: Clap your hands and stamp your foot, and say,
      Alas for all the vile abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall
      by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. '
    12: '¹² Those far off shall die of pestilence; those nearby shall fall by the
      sword; and any who are left and are spared shall die of famine. Thus I will
      spend my fury upon them. '
    13: '¹³ And you shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain lie among their
      idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountain tops, under
      every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing
      odor to all their idols. '
    14: ¹⁴ I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate and
      waste, throughout all their settlements, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then
      they shall know that I am the Lord.
  7:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: "² You, O mortal, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel:\nAn end! The\
      \ end has come\n    upon the four corners of the land.\n"
    3: "³ Now the end is upon you,\n    I will let loose my anger upon you;\nI will\
      \ judge you according to your ways,\n    I will punish you for all your abominations.\n"
    4: "⁴ My eye will not spare you, I will have no pity.\n    I will punish you for\
      \ your ways,\n    while your abominations are among you.\nThen you shall know\
      \ that I am the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord God:\nDisaster after disaster! See, it comes.\n"
    6: "⁶     An end has come, the end has come.\nIt has awakened against you; see,\
      \ it comes!\n"
    7: "⁷ Your doom has come to you,\n    O inhabitant of the land.\nThe time has\
      \ come, the day is near—\n    of tumult, not of reveling on the mountains.\n"
    8: "⁸ Soon now I will pour out my wrath upon you;\n    I will spend my anger against\
      \ you.\nI will judge you according to your ways,\n    and punish you for all\
      \ your abominations.\n"
    9: "⁹ My eye will not spare; I will have no pity.\n    I will punish you according\
      \ to your ways,\n    while your abominations are among you.\nThen you shall\
      \ know that it is I the Lord who strike. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, the day! See, it comes!\n    Your doom has gone out.\nThe rod has\
      \ blossomed, pride has budded.\n"
    11: "¹¹     Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness.\nNone of them shall remain,\n\
      \    not their abundance, not their wealth;\n    no pre-eminence among them.\n"
    12: "¹² The time has come, the day draws near;\n    let not the buyer rejoice,\
      \ nor the seller mourn,\n    for wrath is upon all their multitude. \n"
    13: "¹³ For the sellers shall not return to what has been sold as long as they\
      \ remain alive. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not be\
      \ revoked. Because of their iniquity, they cannot maintain their lives. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They have blown the horn and made everything ready;\n    but no one goes\
      \ to battle,\n    for my wrath is upon all their multitude.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sword is outside, pestilence and famine are inside;\n    those in\
      \ the field die by the sword;\n    those in the city—famine and pestilence devour\
      \ them.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ If any survivors escape,\n    they shall be found on the mountains\n \
      \   like doves of the valleys,\nall of them moaning over their iniquity.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ All hands shall grow feeble,\n    all knees turn to water.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ They shall put on sackcloth,\n    horror shall cover them.\nShame shall\
      \ be on all faces,\n    baldness on all their heads.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They shall fling their silver into the streets,\n    their gold shall\
      \ be treated as unclean.\nTheir silver and gold cannot save them on the day\
      \ of the wrath of the Lord. They shall not satisfy their hunger or fill their\
      \ stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. "
    20: "²⁰ From their beautiful ornament, in which they took pride, they made their\
      \ abominable images, their detestable things; therefore I will make of it an\
      \ unclean thing to them. \n"
    21: "²¹ I will hand it over to strangers as booty,\n    to the wicked of the earth\
      \ as plunder;\n    they shall profane it.\n"
    22: "²² I will avert my face from them,\n    so that they may profane my treasured\
      \ place;\nthe violent shall enter it,\n    they shall profane it.\n"
    23: "²³ Make a chain!\nFor the land is full of bloody crimes;\n    the city is\
      \ full of violence.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I will bring the worst of the nations\n    to take possession of their\
      \ houses.\nI will put an end to the arrogance of the strong,\n    and their\
      \ holy places shall be profaned.\n"
    25: "²⁵ When anguish comes, they will seek peace,\n    but there shall be none.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Disaster comes upon disaster,\n    rumor follows rumor;\nthey shall keep\
      \ seeking a vision from the prophet;\n    instruction shall perish from the\
      \ priest,\n    and counsel from the elders.\n"
    27: "²⁷ The king shall mourn,\n    the prince shall be wrapped in despair,\n \
      \   and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble.\nAccording to their\
      \ way I will deal with them;\n    according to their own judgments I will judge\
      \ them.\nAnd they shall know that I am the Lord."
  8:
    1: '¹ In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as
      I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the
      Lord God fell upon me there. '
    2: '² I looked, and there was a figure that looked like a human being; below what
      appeared to be its loins it was fire, and above the loins it was like the appearance
      of brightness, like gleaming amber. '
    3: '³ It stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and
      the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions
      of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that
      faces north, to the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. '
    4: "⁴ And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I had\
      \ seen in the valley. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then God said to me, “O mortal, lift up your eyes now in the direction of
      the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the
      altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. '
    6: "⁶ He said to me, “Mortal, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations\
      \ that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary?\
      \ Yet you will see still greater abominations.” \n"
    7: '⁷ And he brought me to the entrance of the court; I looked, and there was
      a hole in the wall. '
    8: '⁸ Then he said to me, “Mortal, dig through the wall”; and when I dug through
      the wall, there was an entrance. '
    9: '⁹ He said to me, “Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing
      here.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So I went in and looked; there, portrayed on the wall all around, were
      all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome animals, and all the idols of the
      house of Israel. '
    11: '¹¹ Before them stood seventy of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah
      son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the
      fragrant cloud of incense was ascending. '
    12: '¹² Then he said to me, “Mortal, have you seen what the elders of the house
      of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of images? For they say, ‘The
      Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.’” '
    13: "¹³ He said also to me, “You will see still greater abominations that they\
      \ are committing.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the
      Lord; women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O mortal? You will see still\
      \ greater abominations than these.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord; there,
      at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar,
      were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the Lord, and
      their faces toward the east, prostrating themselves to the sun toward the east. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O mortal? Is it not bad enough
      that the house of Judah commits the abominations done here? Must they fill the
      land with violence, and provoke my anger still further? See, they are putting
      the branch to their nose! '
    18: ¹⁸ Therefore I will act in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity;
      and though they cry in my hearing with a loud voice, I will not listen to them.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Then he cried in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, you executioners
      of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.” '
    2: "² And six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north,\
      \ each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand; among them was a man clothed\
      \ in linen, with a writing case at his side. They went in and stood beside the\
      \ bronze altar. \n"
    3: '³ Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which
      it rested to the threshold of the house. The Lord called to the man clothed
      in linen, who had the writing case at his side; '
    4: '⁴ and said to him, “Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark
      on the foreheads of those who sigh and groan over all the abominations that
      are committed in it.” '
    5: '⁵ To the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and
      kill; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity. '
    6: '⁶ Cut down old men, young men and young women, little children and women,
      but touch no one who has the mark. And begin at my sanctuary.” So they began
      with the elders who were in front of the house. '
    7: '⁷ Then he said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain.
      Go!” So they went out and killed in the city. '
    8: '⁸ While they were killing, and I was left alone, I fell prostrate on my face
      and cried out, “Ah Lord God! will you destroy all who remain of Israel as you
      pour out your wrath upon Jerusalem?” '
    9: '⁹ He said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
      great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of perversity; for they
      say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see.’ '
    10: "¹⁰ As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will bring\
      \ down their deeds upon their heads.” \n"
    11: ¹¹ Then the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought
      back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded me.”
  10:
    1: '¹ Then I looked, and above the dome that was over the heads of the cherubim
      there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in form resembling a throne. '
    2: '² He said to the man clothed in linen, “Go within the wheelwork underneath
      the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim, and
      scatter them over the city.” He went in as I looked on. '
    3: '³ Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house when the man
      went in; and a cloud filled the inner court. '
    4: '⁴ Then the glory of the Lord rose up from the cherub to the threshold of the
      house; the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness
      of the glory of the Lord. '
    5: "⁵ The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court,\
      \ like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. \n"
    6: '⁶ When he commanded the man clothed in linen, “Take fire from within the wheelwork,
      from among the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel. '
    7: '⁷ And a cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire
      that was among the cherubim, took some of it and put it into the hands of the
      man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. '
    8: "⁸ The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each
      cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like gleaming beryl. '
    10: '¹⁰ And as for their appearance, the four looked alike, something like a wheel
      within a wheel. '
    11: '¹¹ When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering
      as they moved; but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed
      without veering as they moved. '
    12: '¹² Their entire body, their rims, their spokes, their wings, and the wheels—the
      wheels of the four of them—were full of eyes all around. '
    13: '¹³ As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing “the wheelwork.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Each one had four faces: the first face was that of the cherub, the second\
      \ face was that of a human being, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that\
      \ of an eagle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The cherubim rose up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the
      river Chebar. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the cherubim
      lifted up their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels at their side did
      not veer. '
    17: "¹⁷ When they stopped, the others stopped, and when they rose up, the others\
      \ rose up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the glory of the Lord went out from the threshold of the house and
      stopped above the cherubim. '
    19: "¹⁹ The cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight\
      \ as they went out with the wheels beside them. They stopped at the entrance\
      \ of the east gate of the house of the Lord; and the glory of the God of Israel\
      \ was above them. \n"
    20: '²⁰ These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel
      by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. '
    21: '²¹ Each had four faces, each four wings, and underneath their wings something
      like human hands. '
    22: ²² As for what their faces were like, they were the same faces whose appearance
      I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one moved straight ahead.
  11:
    1: '¹ The spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of
      the Lord, which faces east. There, at the entrance of the gateway, were twenty-five
      men; among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, officials
      of the people. '
    2: '² He said to me, “Mortal, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give
      wicked counsel in this city; '
    3: '³ they say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the pot, and
      we are the meat.’ '
    4: "⁴ Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O mortal.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus
      says the Lord: This is what you think, O house of Israel; I know the things
      that come into your mind. '
    6: '⁶ You have killed many in this city, and have filled its streets with the
      slain. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord God: The slain whom you have placed within
      it are the meat, and this city is the pot; but you shall be taken out of it. '
    8: '⁸ You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the
      Lord God. '
    9: '⁹ I will take you out of it and give you over to the hands of foreigners,
      and execute judgments upon you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel.
      And you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ This city shall not be your pot, and you shall not be the meat inside
      it; I will judge you at the border of Israel. '
    12: "¹² Then you shall know that I am the Lord, whose statutes you have not followed,\
      \ and whose ordinances you have not kept, but you have acted according to the\
      \ ordinances of the nations that are around you.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Now, while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell\
      \ down on my face, cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord God! will you\
      \ make a full end of the remnant of Israel?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    15: '¹⁵ Mortal, your kinsfolk, your own kin, your fellow exiles, the whole house
      of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have
      said, “They have gone far from the Lord; to us this land is given for a possession.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: Though I removed them far away
      among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have
      been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have
      gone. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples,
      and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will
      give you the land of Israel. '
    18: '¹⁸ When they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things
      and all its abominations. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will remove
      the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, '
    20: '²⁰ so that they may follow my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them.
      Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God. '
    21: "²¹ But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their\
      \ abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    22: '²² Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them;
      and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. '
    23: '²³ And the glory of the Lord ascended from the middle of the city, and stopped
      on the mountain east of the city. '
    24: '²⁴ The spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God
      into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen left me. '
    25: ²⁵ And I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me.
  12:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, you are living in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes
      to see but do not see, who have ears to hear but do not hear; '
    3: '³ for they are a rebellious house. Therefore, mortal, prepare for yourself
      an exile’s baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight; you shall go like
      an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will
      understand, though they are a rebellious house. '
    4: '⁴ You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile;
      and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who go
      into exile. '
    5: '⁵ Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry the baggage through it. '
    6: "⁶ In their sight you shall lift the baggage on your shoulder, and carry it\
      \ out in the dark; you shall cover your face, so that you may not see the land;\
      \ for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel. \n"
    7: "⁷ I did just as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage\
      \ for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands; I\
      \ brought it out in the dark, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight. \n"
    8: '⁸ In the morning the word of the Lord came to me: '
    9: '⁹ Mortal, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you,
      “What are you doing?” '
    10: '¹⁰ Say to them, “Thus says the Lord God: This oracle concerns the prince
      in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel in it.” '
    11: '¹¹ Say, “I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them;
      they shall go into exile, into captivity.” '
    12: '¹² And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage on his shoulder
      in the dark, and shall go out; he shall dig through the wall and carry it through;
      he shall cover his face, so that he may not see the land with his eyes. '
    13: '¹³ I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare; and
      I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see
      it; and he shall die there. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all
      his troops; and I will unsheathe the sword behind them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I disperse them among the
      nations and scatter them through the countries. '
    16: "¹⁶ But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence,\
      \ so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations where they\
      \ go; then they shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    18: '¹⁸ Mortal, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling
      and with fearfulness; '
    19: '¹⁹ and say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord God concerning the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with
      fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, because their land shall be stripped
      of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who live in it. '
    20: "²⁰ The inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a\
      \ desolation; and you shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    21: '²¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    22: '²² Mortal, what is this proverb of yours about the land of Israel, which
      says, “The days are prolonged, and every vision comes to nothing”? '
    23: '²³ Tell them therefore, “Thus says the Lord God: I will put an end to this
      proverb, and they shall use it no more as a proverb in Israel.” But say to them,
      The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision. '
    24: '²⁴ For there shall no longer be any false vision or flattering divination
      within the house of Israel. '
    25: "²⁵ But I the Lord will speak the word that I speak, and it will be fulfilled.\
      \ It will no longer be delayed; but in your days, O rebellious house, I will\
      \ speak the word and fulfill it, says the Lord God. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    27: '²⁷ Mortal, the house of Israel is saying, “The vision that he sees is for
      many years ahead; he prophesies for distant times.” '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God: None of my words will be
      delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be fulfilled, says the Lord
      God.'
  13:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying; say
      to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: “Hear the word of the Lord!” '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord God, Alas for the senseless prophets who follow their
      own spirit, and have seen nothing! '
    4: '⁴ Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel. '
    5: '⁵ You have not gone up into the breaches, or repaired a wall for the house
      of Israel, so that it might stand in battle on the day of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ They have envisioned falsehood and lying divination; they say, “Says the
      Lord,” when the Lord has not sent them, and yet they wait for the fulfillment
      of their word! '
    7: "⁷ Have you not seen a false vision or uttered a lying divination, when you\
      \ have said, “Says the Lord,” even though I did not speak? \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have uttered falsehood and
      envisioned lies, I am against you, says the Lord God. '
    9: '⁹ My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying
      divinations; they shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled
      in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel;
      and you shall know that I am the Lord God. '
    10: '¹⁰ Because, in truth, because they have misled my people, saying, “Peace,”
      when there is no peace; and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets
      smear whitewash on it. '
    11: '¹¹ Say to those who smear whitewash on it that it shall fall. There will
      be a deluge of rain, great hailstones will fall, and a stormy wind will break
      out. '
    12: '¹² When the wall falls, will it not be said to you, “Where is the whitewash
      you smeared on it?” '
    13: '¹³ Therefore thus says the Lord God: In my wrath I will make a stormy wind
      break out, and in my anger there shall be a deluge of rain, and hailstones in
      wrath to destroy it. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring
      it to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you
      shall perish within it; and you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ Thus I will spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have smeared
      it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who
      smeared it— '
    16: "¹⁶ the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions\
      \ of peace for it, when there was no peace, says the Lord God. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ As for you, mortal, set your face against the daughters of your people,
      who prophesy out of their own imagination; prophesy against them '
    18: '¹⁸ and say, Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the women who sew bands on all
      wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every height, in the hunt
      for human lives! Will you hunt down lives among my people, and maintain your
      own lives? '
    19: "¹⁹ You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces\
      \ of bread, putting to death persons who should not die and keeping alive persons\
      \ who should not live, by your lies to my people, who listen to lies. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore thus says the Lord God: I am against your bands with which you
      hunt lives; I will tear them from your arms, and let the lives go free, the
      lives that you hunt down like birds. '
    21: '²¹ I will tear off your veils, and save my people from your hands; they shall
      no longer be prey in your hands; and you shall know that I am the Lord. '
    22: '²² Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not
      disheartened them, and you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their
      wicked way and save their lives; '
    23: ²³ therefore you shall no longer see false visions or practice divination;
      I will save my people from your hand. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
  14:
    1: '¹ Certain elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me. '
    2: '² And the word of the Lord came to me: '
    3: '³ Mortal, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and placed their
      iniquity as a stumbling block before them; shall I let myself be consulted by
      them? '
    4: '⁴ Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Any of
      those of the house of Israel who take their idols into their hearts and place
      their iniquity as a stumbling block before them, and yet come to the prophet—I
      the Lord will answer those who come with the multitude of their idols, '
    5: "⁵ in order that I may take hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, all\
      \ of whom are estranged from me through their idols. \n"
    6: '⁶ Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: Repent and
      turn away from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. '
    7: '⁷ For any of those of the house of Israel, or of the aliens who reside in
      Israel, who separate themselves from me, taking their idols into their hearts
      and placing their iniquity as a stumbling block before them, and yet come to
      a prophet to inquire of me by him, I the Lord will answer them myself. '
    8: "⁸ I will set my face against them; I will make them a sign and a byword and\
      \ cut them off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ If a prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the Lord, have deceived that
      prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from
      the midst of my people Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they shall bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer and
      the punishment of the prophet shall be the same— '
    11: "¹¹ so that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, nor defile\
      \ themselves any more with all their transgressions. Then they shall be my people,\
      \ and I will be their God, says the Lord God. \n"
    12: '¹² The word of the Lord came to me: '
    13: '¹³ Mortal, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch
      out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it,
      and cut off from it human beings and animals, '
    14: '¹⁴ even if Noah, Daniel, and Job, these three, were in it, they would save
      only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord God. '
    15: '¹⁵ If I send wild animals through the land to ravage it, so that it is made
      desolate, and no one may pass through because of the animals; '
    16: '¹⁶ even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord God, they
      would save neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be saved, but the land
      would be desolate. '
    17: '¹⁷ Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, “Let a sword pass through
      the land,” and I cut off human beings and animals from it; '
    18: '¹⁸ though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord God, they
      would save neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be saved. '
    19: '¹⁹ Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it
      with blood, to cut off humans and animals from it; '
    20: "²⁰ even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord God,\
      \ they would save neither son nor daughter; they would save only their own lives\
      \ by their righteousness. \n"
    21: '²¹ For thus says the Lord God: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my
      four deadly acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild animals, and pestilence, to
      cut off humans and animals from it! '
    22: '²² Yet, survivors shall be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought
      out; they will come out to you. When you see their ways and their deeds, you
      will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that
      I have brought upon it. '
    23: ²³ They shall console you, when you see their ways and their deeds; and you
      shall know that it was not without cause that I did all that I have done in
      it, says the Lord God.
  15:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord came to me: \n"
    2: "² O mortal, how does the wood of the vine surpass all other wood—\n    the\
      \ vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?\n"
    3: "³ Is wood taken from it to make anything?\n    Does one take a peg from it\
      \ on which to hang any object?\n"
    4: "⁴ It is put in the fire for fuel;\n    when the fire has consumed both ends\
      \ of it\n    and the middle of it is charred,\n    is it useful for anything?\n"
    5: "⁵ When it was whole it was used for nothing;\n    how much less—when the fire\
      \ has consumed it,\n    and it is charred—\n    can it ever be used for anything!\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the vine among the trees
      of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    7: '⁷ I will set my face against them; although they escape from the fire, the
      fire shall still consume them; and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I
      set my face against them. '
    8: ⁸ And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, says
      the Lord God.
  16:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, make known to Jerusalem her abominations, '
    3: '³ and say, Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth
      were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite, and your mother
      a Hittite. '
    4: '⁴ As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut,
      nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped
      in cloths. '
    5: "⁵ No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you out of compassion for\
      \ you; but you were thrown out in the open field, for you were abhorred on the\
      \ day you were born. \n"
    6: '⁶ I passed by you, and saw you flailing about in your blood. As you lay in
      your blood, I said to you, “Live! '
    7: "⁷ and grow up like a plant of the field.” You grew up and became tall and\
      \ arrived at full womanhood; your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown;\
      \ yet you were naked and bare. \n"
    8: '⁸ I passed by you again and looked on you; you were at the age for love. I
      spread the edge of my cloak over you, and covered your nakedness: I pledged
      myself to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord God, and you
      became mine. '
    9: '⁹ Then I bathed you with water and washed off the blood from you, and anointed
      you with oil. '
    10: '¹⁰ I clothed you with embroidered cloth and with sandals of fine leather;
      I bound you in fine linen and covered you with rich fabric. '
    11: '¹¹ I adorned you with ornaments: I put bracelets on your arms, a chain on
      your neck, '
    12: '¹² a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon
      your head. '
    13: '¹³ You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine
      linen, rich fabric, and embroidered cloth. You had choice flour and honey and
      oil for food. You grew exceedingly beautiful, fit to be a queen. '
    14: "¹⁴ Your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was\
      \ perfect because of my splendor that I had bestowed on you, says the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But you trusted in your beauty, and played the whore because of your fame,
      and lavished your whorings on any passer-by. '
    16: '¹⁶ You took some of your garments, and made for yourself colorful shrines,
      and on them played the whore; nothing like this has ever been or ever shall
      be. '
    17: '¹⁷ You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and my silver that I had
      given you, and made for yourself male images, and with them played the whore; '
    18: '¹⁸ and you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and
      my incense before them. '
    19: '¹⁹ Also my bread that I gave you—I fed you with choice flour and oil and
      honey—you set it before them as a pleasing odor; and so it was, says the Lord
      God. '
    20: '²⁰ You took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these
      you sacrificed to them to be devoured. As if your whorings were not enough! '
    21: '²¹ You slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering to them. '
    22: "²² And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the\
      \ days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, flailing about in your blood.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ After all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! says the Lord God), '
    24: '²⁴ you built yourself a platform and made yourself a lofty place in every
      square; '
    25: '²⁵ at the head of every street you built your lofty place and prostituted
      your beauty, offering yourself to every passer-by, and multiplying your whoring. '
    26: '²⁶ You played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying
      your whoring, to provoke me to anger. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore I stretched out my hand against you, reduced your rations, and
      gave you up to the will of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who
      were ashamed of your lewd behavior. '
    28: '²⁸ You played the whore with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable;
      you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied. '
    29: "²⁹ You multiplied your whoring with Chaldea, the land of merchants; and even\
      \ with this you were not satisfied. \n"
    30: '³⁰ How sick is your heart, says the Lord God, that you did all these things,
      the deeds of a brazen whore; '
    31: '³¹ building your platform at the head of every street, and making your lofty
      place in every square! Yet you were not like a whore, because you scorned payment. '
    32: '³² Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! '
    33: '³³ Gifts are given to all whores; but you gave your gifts to all your lovers,
      bribing them to come to you from all around for your whorings. '
    34: "³⁴ So you were different from other women in your whorings: no one solicited\
      \ you to play the whore; and you gave payment, while no payment was given to\
      \ you; you were different. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Therefore, O whore, hear the word of the Lord: '
    36: '³⁶ Thus says the Lord God, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness
      uncovered in your whoring with your lovers, and because of all your abominable
      idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them, '
    37: '³⁷ therefore, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure,
      all those you loved and all those you hated; I will gather them against you
      from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, so that they may see
      all your nakedness. '
    38: '³⁸ I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged,
      and bring blood upon you in wrath and jealousy. '
    39: '³⁹ I will deliver you into their hands, and they shall throw down your platform
      and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take
      your beautiful objects and leave you naked and bare. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They shall bring up a mob against you, and they shall stone you and cut
      you to pieces with their swords. '
    41: '⁴¹ They shall burn your houses and execute judgments on you in the sight
      of many women; I will stop you from playing the whore, and you shall also make
      no more payments. '
    42: '⁴² So I will satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall turn away from
      you; I will be calm, and will be angry no longer. '
    43: "⁴³ Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged\
      \ me with all these things; therefore, I have returned your deeds upon your\
      \ head, says the Lord God.\nHave you not committed lewdness beyond all your\
      \ abominations? "
    44: '⁴⁴ See, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, “Like
      mother, like daughter.” '
    45: '⁴⁵ You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children;
      and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their
      children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north
      of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with
      her daughters. '
    47: '⁴⁷ You not only followed their ways, and acted according to their abominations;
      within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. '
    48: '⁴⁸ As I live, says the Lord God, your sister Sodom and her daughters have
      not done as you and your daughters have done. '
    49: '⁴⁹ This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride,
      excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. '
    50: '⁵⁰ They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed
      them when I saw it. '
    51: '⁵¹ Samaria has not committed half your sins; you have committed more abominations
      than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations
      that you have committed. '
    52: "⁵² Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have brought about for your sisters\
      \ a more favorable judgment; because of your sins in which you acted more abominably\
      \ than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and\
      \ bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. \n"
    53: '⁵³ I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters
      and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes
      along with theirs, '
    54: '⁵⁴ in order that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you
      have done, becoming a consolation to them. '
    55: '⁵⁵ As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former
      state, Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you
      and your daughters shall return to your former state. '
    56: '⁵⁶ Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride, '
    57: '⁵⁷ before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you are a mockery to the daughters
      of Aram and all her neighbors, and to the daughters of the Philistines, those
      all around who despise you. '
    58: "⁵⁸ You must bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ Yes, thus says the Lord God: I will deal with you as you have done, you
      who have despised the oath, breaking the covenant; '
    60: '⁶⁰ yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and
      I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. '
    61: '⁶¹ Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed when I take your sisters,
      both your elder and your younger, and give them to you as daughters, but not
      on account of my covenant with you. '
    62: '⁶² I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the
      Lord, '
    63: ⁶³ in order that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth
      again because of your shame, when I forgive you all that you have done, says
      the Lord God.
  17:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² O mortal, propound a riddle, and speak an allegory to the house of Israel. '
    3: "³ Say: Thus says the Lord God:\nA great eagle, with great wings and long pinions,\n\
      \    rich in plumage of many colors,\n    came to the Lebanon.\nHe took the\
      \ top of the cedar,\n"
    4: "⁴     broke off its topmost shoot;\nhe carried it to a land of trade,\n  \
      \  set it in a city of merchants.\n"
    5: "⁵ Then he took a seed from the land,\n    placed it in fertile soil;\na plant\
      \ by abundant waters,\n    he set it like a willow twig.\n"
    6: "⁶ It sprouted and became a vine\n    spreading out, but low;\nits branches\
      \ turned toward him,\n    its roots remained where it stood.\nSo it became a\
      \ vine;\n    it brought forth branches,\n    put forth foliage. \n"
    7: "⁷ There was another great eagle,\n    with great wings and much plumage.\n\
      And see! This vine stretched out\n    its roots toward him;\nit shot out its\
      \ branches toward him,\n    so that he might water it.\nFrom the bed where it\
      \ was planted\n"
    8: "⁸     it was transplanted\nto good soil by abundant waters,\n    so that it\
      \ might produce branches\n    and bear fruit\n    and become a noble vine. \n"
    9: "⁹ Say: Thus says the Lord God:\nWill it prosper?\nWill he not pull up its\
      \ roots,\n    cause its fruit to rot and wither,\n    its fresh sprouting leaves\
      \ to fade?\nNo strong arm or mighty army will be needed\n    to pull it from\
      \ its roots.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ When it is transplanted, will it thrive?\nWhen the east wind strikes it,\n\
      \    will it not utterly wither,\n    wither on the bed where it grew? \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    12: '¹² Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean?
      Tell them: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and its officials,
      and brought them back with him to Babylon. '
    13: '¹³ He took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting
      him under oath (he had taken away the chief men of the land), '
    14: '¹⁴ so that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and that by
      keeping his covenant it might stand. '
    15: '¹⁵ But he rebelled against him by sending ambassadors to Egypt, in order
      that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can one escape
      who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape? '
    16: '¹⁶ As I live, says the Lord God, surely in the place where the king resides
      who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke—in
      Babylon he shall die. '
    17: '¹⁷ Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war,
      when ramps are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives. '
    18: '¹⁸ Because he despised the oath and broke the covenant, because he gave his
      hand and yet did all these things, he shall not escape. '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore thus says the Lord God: As I live, I will surely return upon
      his head my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. '
    20: '²⁰ I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare; I will
      bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treason
      he has committed against me. '
    21: "²¹ All the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors\
      \ shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the Lord, have\
      \ spoken. \n"
    22: "²² Thus says the Lord God:\nI myself will take a sprig\n    from the lofty\
      \ top of a cedar;\n    I will set it out.\nI will break off a tender one\n \
      \   from the topmost of its young twigs;\nI myself will plant it\n    on a high\
      \ and lofty mountain.\n"
    23: "²³ On the mountain height of Israel\n    I will plant it,\nin order that\
      \ it may produce boughs and bear fruit,\n    and become a noble cedar.\nUnder\
      \ it every kind of bird will live;\n    in the shade of its branches will nest\n\
      \    winged creatures of every kind.\n"
    24: "²⁴ All the trees of the field shall know\n    that I am the Lord.\nI bring\
      \ low the high tree,\n    I make high the low tree;\nI dry up the green tree\n\
      \    and make the dry tree flourish.\nI the Lord have spoken;\n    I will accomplish\
      \ it."
  18:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
      “The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge”? '
    3: '³ As I live, says the Lord God, this proverb shall no more be used by you
      in Israel. '
    4: "⁴ Know that all lives are mine; the life of the parent as well as the life\
      \ of the child is mine: it is only the person who sins that shall die. \n"
    5: '⁵ If a man is righteous and does what is lawful and right— '
    6: '⁶ if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of
      the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman
      during her menstrual period, '
    7: '⁷ does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits
      no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, '
    8: '⁸ does not take advance or accrued interest, withholds his hand from iniquity,
      executes true justice between contending parties, '
    9: "⁹ follows my statutes, and is careful to observe my ordinances, acting faithfully—such\
      \ a one is righteous; he shall surely live, says the Lord God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ If he has a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, '
    11: '¹¹ who does any of these things (though his father does none of them), who
      eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife, '
    12: '¹² oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge,
      lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination, '
    13: "¹³ takes advance or accrued interest; shall he then live? He shall not. He\
      \ has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall\
      \ be upon himself. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ But if this man has a son who sees all the sins that his father has done,
      considers, and does not do likewise, '
    15: '¹⁵ who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of
      the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife, '
    16: '¹⁶ does not wrong anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives
      his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, '
    17: '¹⁷ withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no advance or accrued interest,
      observes my ordinances, and follows my statutes; he shall not die for his father’s
      iniquity; he shall surely live. '
    18: "¹⁸ As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother,\
      \ and did what is not good among his people, he dies for his iniquity. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Yet you say, “Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?”
      When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe
      all my statutes, he shall surely live. '
    20: "²⁰ The person who sins shall die. A child shall not suffer for the iniquity\
      \ of a parent, nor a parent suffer for the iniquity of a child; the righteousness\
      \ of the righteous shall be his own, and the wickedness of the wicked shall\
      \ be his own. \n"
    21: '²¹ But if the wicked turn away from all their sins that they have committed
      and keep all my statutes and do what is lawful and right, they shall surely

    22: '²² None of the transgressions that they have committed shall be remembered

    25: '²⁵ Yet you say, “The way of the Lord is unfair.” Hear now, O house of Israel:
      Is my way unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair? '
    26: '²⁶ When the righteous turn away from their righteousness and commit iniquity,
      they shall die for it; for the iniquity that they have committed they shall
      die. '
    27: '²⁷ Again, when the wicked turn away from the wickedness they have committed
      and do what is lawful and right, they shall save their life. '
    28: '²⁸ Because they considered and turned away from all the transgressions that
      they had committed, they shall surely live; they shall not die. '
    29: "²⁹ Yet the house of Israel says, “The way of the Lord is unfair.” O house\
      \ of Israel, are my ways unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair? \n"
    30: '³⁰ Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, all of you according to
      your ways, says the Lord God. Repent and turn from all your transgressions;
      otherwise iniquity will be your ruin. '
    31: '³¹ Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed against
      me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house
      of Israel? '
    32: ³² For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, says the Lord God. Turn,
      then, and live.

    11: "¹¹ Its strongest stem became\n    a ruler’s scepter;\nit towered aloft\n\
      \    among the thick boughs;\nit stood out in its height\n    with its mass\
      \ of branches.\n"
    12: "¹² But it was plucked up in fury,\n    cast down to the ground;\nthe east\
      \ wind dried it up;\n    its fruit was stripped off,\nits strong stem was withered;\n\
      \    the fire consumed it.\n"
    13: "¹³ Now it is transplanted into the wilderness,\n    into a dry and thirsty\
      \ land.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And fire has gone out from its stem,\n    has consumed its branches and\
      \ fruit,\nso that there remains in it no strong stem,\n    no scepter for ruling.\n\
      This is a lamentation, and it is used as a lamentation."
  20:
    1: '¹ In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month,
      certain elders of Israel came to consult the Lord, and sat down before me. '
    2: '² And the word of the Lord came to me: '
    3: '³ Mortal, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them: Thus says the Lord
      God: Why are you coming? To consult me? As I live, says the Lord God, I will
      not be consulted by you. '
    4: '⁴ Will you judge them, mortal, will you judge them? Then let them know the
      abominations of their ancestors, '
    5: '⁵ and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: On the day when I chose Israel,
      I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob—making myself known to them in
      the land of Egypt—I swore to them, saying, I am the Lord your God. '
    6: '⁶ On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt
      into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey,
      the most glorious of all lands. '
    7: '⁷ And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on,
      every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am
      the Lord your God. '
    8: "⁸ But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; not one of them\
      \ cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake\
      \ the idols of Egypt.\nThen I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and\
      \ spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. "
    9: '⁹ But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the
      sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known
      to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. '
    10: '¹⁰ So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. '
    11: '¹¹ I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance
      everyone shall live. '
    12: '¹² Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, so that
      they might know that I the Lord sanctify them. '
    13: "¹³ But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did\
      \ not observe my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance everyone\
      \ shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned.\nThen I thought I would\
      \ pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make an end of them. "
    14: '¹⁴ But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it should not be profaned
      in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them
      into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the
      most glorious of all lands, '
    16: '¹⁶ because they rejected my ordinances and did not observe my statutes, and
      profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. '
    17: "¹⁷ Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make an\
      \ end of them in the wilderness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not follow the statutes
      of your parents, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their
      idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I the Lord am your God; follow my statutes, and be careful to observe
      my ordinances, '
    20: '²⁰ and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, so
      that you may know that I the Lord am your God. '
    21: "²¹ But the children rebelled against me; they did not follow my statutes,\
      \ and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance everyone\
      \ shall live; they profaned my sabbaths.\nThen I thought I would pour out my\
      \ wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. "
    22: '²² But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so that it
      should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought
      them out. '
    23: '²³ Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among
      the nations and disperse them through the countries, '
    24: '²⁴ because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes
      and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their ancestors’ idols. '
    25: '²⁵ Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which
      they could not live. '
    26: "²⁶ I defiled them through their very gifts, in their offering up all their\
      \ firstborn, in order that I might horrify them, so that they might know that\
      \ I am the Lord. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Therefore, mortal, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus
      says the Lord God: In this again your ancestors blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously
      with me. '
    28: '²⁸ For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then
      wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their
      sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent
      up their pleasing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings. '
    29: '²⁹ (I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So it is called
      Bamah to this day.) '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: Will you
      defile yourselves after the manner of your ancestors and go astray after their
      detestable things? '
    31: "³¹ When you offer your gifts and make your children pass through the fire,\
      \ you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be consulted\
      \ by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord God, I will not be consulted\
      \ by you. \n"
    32: "³² What is in your mind shall never happen—the thought, “Let us be like the\
      \ nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.” \n"
    33: '³³ As I live, says the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched
      arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you. '
    34: '³⁴ I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries
      where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with
      wrath poured out; '
    35: '³⁵ and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will
      enter into judgment with you face to face. '
    36: '³⁶ As I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of the
      land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord God. '
    37: '³⁷ I will make you pass under the staff, and will bring you within the bond
      of the covenant. '
    38: "³⁸ I will purge out the rebels among you, and those who transgress against\
      \ me; I will bring them out of the land where they reside as aliens, but they\
      \ shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    39: "³⁹ As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Go serve your idols,\
      \ every one of you now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy\
      \ name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord
      God, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land;
      there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the
      choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred things. '
    41: '⁴¹ As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples,
      and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will
      manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations. '
    42: '⁴² You shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel,
      the country that I swore to give to your ancestors. '
    43: '⁴³ There you shall remember your ways and all the deeds by which you have
      polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that
      you have committed. '
    44: "⁴⁴ And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for my name’s\
      \ sake, not according to your evil ways, or corrupt deeds, O house of Israel,\
      \ says the Lord God. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    46: '⁴⁶ Mortal, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and
      prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb; '
    47: '⁴⁷ say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the
      Lord God, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree
      in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all
      faces from south to north shall be scorched by it. '
    48: '⁴⁸ All flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it; it shall not be quenched. '
    49: ⁴⁹ Then I said, “Ah Lord God! they are saying of me, ‘Is he not a maker of
      allegories?’”
  21:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries;

      and wicked. '
    4: '⁴ Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my
      sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north; '
    5: '⁵ and all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its
      sheath; it shall not be sheathed again. '
    6: '⁶ Moan therefore, mortal; moan with breaking heart and bitter grief before
      their eyes. '
    7: "⁷ And when they say to you, “Why do you moan?” you shall say, “Because of\
      \ the news that has come. Every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble,\
      \ every spirit will faint and all knees will turn to water. See, it comes and\

    20: '²⁰ mark out the road for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites or

    22: '²² Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams,

    27: '²⁷ Its officials within it are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood,
      destroying lives to get dishonest gain. '
    28: '²⁸ Its prophets have smeared whitewash on their behalf, seeing false visions
      and divining lies for them, saying, “Thus says the Lord God,” when the Lord

    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; '
    3: '³ they played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; their

      \ is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. \n"
    5: '⁵ Oholah played the whore while she was mine; she lusted after her lovers
      the Assyrians, warriors '
    6: '⁶ clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men,
      mounted horsemen. '
    7: '⁷ She bestowed her favors upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them;
      and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone for whom she lusted. '
    8: '⁸ She did not give up her whorings that she had practiced since Egypt; for
      in her youth men had lain with her and fondled her virgin bosom and poured out
      their lust upon her. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of
      the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. '
    10: "¹⁰ These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters;\
      \ and they killed her with the sword. Judgment was executed upon her, and she\
      \ became a byword among women. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she in her
      lusting and in her whorings, which were worse than those of her sister. '
    12: '¹² She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed
      in full armor, mounted horsemen, all of them handsome young men. '
    13: '¹³ And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way. '
    14: '¹⁴ But she carried her whorings further; she saw male figures carved on the
      wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion, '
    15: '¹⁵ with belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all
      of them looking like officers—a picture of Babylonians whose native land was
      Chaldea. '
    16: '¹⁶ When she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them in
      Chaldea. '
    17: '¹⁷ And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled
      her with their lust; and after she defiled herself with them, she turned from
      them in disgust. '
    18: '¹⁸ When she carried on her whorings so openly and flaunted her nakedness,
      I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her sister. '
    19: '¹⁹ Yet she increased her whorings, remembering the days of her youth, when
      she played the whore in the land of Egypt '
    20: '²⁰ and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of
      donkeys, and whose emission was like that of stallions. '
    21: "²¹ Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled\
      \ your bosom and caressed your young breasts. \n"
    22: '²² Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: I will rouse against you

      them, officers and warriors, all of them riding on horses. '
    24: '²⁴ They shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and
      a host of peoples; they shall set themselves against you on every side with
      buckler, shield, and helmet, and I will commit the judgment to them, and they
      shall judge you according to their ordinances. '
    25: '²⁵ I will direct my indignation against you, in order that they may deal
      with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors

      your survivors shall be devoured by fire. '
    26: '²⁶ They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels. '
    27: '²⁷ So I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring brought from the
      land of Egypt; you shall not long for them, or remember Egypt any more. '
    28: '²⁸ For thus says the Lord God: I will deliver you into the hands of those
      whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust; '
    29: '²⁹ and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit of
      your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whorings

    36: '³⁶ The Lord said to me: Mortal, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then

    37: '³⁷ For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; with their
      idols they have committed adultery; and they have even offered up to them for

    38: '³⁸ Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on
      the same day and profaned my sabbaths. '
    39: "³⁹ For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, on the same\

    43: '⁴³ Then I said, Ah, she is worn out with adulteries, but they carry on their
      sexual acts with her. '
    44: '⁴⁴ For they have gone in to her, as one goes in to a whore. Thus they went
      in to Oholah and to Oholibah, wanton women. '
    45: "⁴⁵ But righteous judges shall declare them guilty of adultery and of bloodshed;\

    46: '⁴⁶ For thus says the Lord God: Bring up an assembly against them, and make
      them an object of terror and of plunder. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The assembly shall stone them and with their swords they shall cut them
      down; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, so that all women may
      take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done. '
    49: ⁴⁹ They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall bear the penalty

    8: '⁸ Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab said, The house of Judah is like all

      righteous shall not be able to live by their righteousness when they sin. '
    13: '¹³ Though I say to the righteous that they shall surely live, yet if they
      trust in their righteousness and commit iniquity, none of their righteous deeds
      shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that they have committed they shall
      die. '
    14: '¹⁴ Again, though I say to the wicked, “You shall surely die,” yet if they
      turn from their sin and do what is lawful and right— '
    15: '¹⁵ if the wicked restore the pledge, give back what they have taken by robbery,
      and walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity—they shall surely live,
      they shall not die. '
    16: "¹⁶ None of the sins that they have committed shall be remembered against\
      \ them; they have done what is lawful and right, they shall surely live. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Yet your people say, “The way of the Lord is not just,” when it is their
      own way that is not just. '
    18: '¹⁸ When the righteous turn from their righteousness, and commit iniquity,
      they shall die for it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when the wicked turn from their wickedness, and do what is lawful
      and right, they shall live by it. '
    20: "²⁰ Yet you say, “The way of the Lord is not just.” O house of Israel, I will\
      \ judge all of you according to your ways! \n"
    21: '²¹ In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day
      of the month, someone who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The
      city has fallen.” '
    22: "²² Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me the evening before the fugitive\
      \ came; but he had opened my mouth by the time the fugitive came to me in the\
      \ morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer unable to speak. \n"
    23: '²³ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    24: '²⁴ Mortal, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep
      saying, “Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we
      are many; the land is surely given us to possess.” '
    25: '²⁵ Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God: You eat flesh with the
      blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; shall you then possess
      the land? '
    26: '²⁶ You depend on your swords, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles
      his neighbor’s wife; shall you then possess the land? '
    27: '²⁷ Say this to them, Thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely those who
      are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and those who are in the open
      field I will give to the wild animals to be devoured; and those who are in strongholds
      and in caves shall die by pestilence. '
    28: '²⁸ I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and its proud might shall
      come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one
      will pass through. '
    29: "²⁹ Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desolation\
      \ and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed. \n"
    30: '³⁰ As for you, mortal, your people who talk together about you by the walls,
      and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to a neighbor, “Come
      and hear what the word is that comes from the Lord.” '
    31: '³¹ They come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people,
      and they hear your words, but they will not obey them. For flattery is on their
      lips, but their heart is set on their gain. '
    32: '³² To them you are like a singer of love songs, one who has a beautiful voice
      and plays well on an instrument; they hear what you say, but they will not do
      it. '
    33: ³³ When this comes—and come it will!—then they shall know that a prophet has
      been among them.
  34:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them—to
      the shepherds: Thus says the Lord God: Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have
      been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? '
    3: '³ You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the
      fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep. '
    4: '⁴ You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have
      not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not
      sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them. '
    5: '⁵ So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they
      became food for all the wild animals. '
    6: "⁶ My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every\
      \ high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no\
      \ one to search or seek for them. \n"
    7: '⁷ Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    8: '⁸ As I live, says the Lord God, because my sheep have become a prey, and my
      sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd;
      and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have
      fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep; '
    9: '⁹ therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    10: "¹⁰ Thus says the Lord God, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand\
      \ my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer\
      \ shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths,\
      \ so that they may not be food for them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will
      seek them out. '
    12: '¹² As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered
      sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to
      which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries,
      and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains
      of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel
      shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and
      they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down,
      says the Lord God. '
    16: "¹⁶ I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind\
      \ up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong\
      \ I will destroy. I will feed them with justice. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God: I shall judge between sheep
      and sheep, between rams and goats: '
    18: '¹⁸ Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, but you must tread
      down with your feet the rest of your pasture? When you drink of clear water,
      must you foul the rest with your feet? '
    19: "¹⁹ And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink\
      \ what you have fouled with your feet? \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, thus says the Lord God to them: I myself will judge between
      the fat sheep and the lean sheep. '
    21: '²¹ Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak
      animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, '
    22: "²² I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will\
      \ judge between sheep and sheep. \n"
    23: '²³ I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed
      them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. '
    24: "²⁴ And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince\
      \ among them; I, the Lord, have spoken. \n"
    25: '²⁵ I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild animals from
      the land, so that they may live in the wild and sleep in the woods securely. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make them and the region around my hill a blessing; and I will
      send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing. '
    27: '²⁷ The trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield
      its increase. They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I
      am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the hands
      of those who enslaved them. '
    28: '²⁸ They shall no more be plunder for the nations, nor shall the animals of
      the land devour them; they shall live in safety, and no one shall make them
      afraid. '
    29: '²⁹ I will provide for them a splendid vegetation so that they shall no more
      be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the insults of the
      nations. '
    30: '³⁰ They shall know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and that they,
      the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord God. '
    31: ³¹ You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture and I am your God, says the Lord
      God.
  35:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, '
    3: "³ and say to it, Thus says the Lord God:\nI am against you, Mount Seir;\n\
      \    I stretch out my hand against you\n    to make you a desolation and a waste.\n"
    4: "⁴ I lay your towns in ruins;\n    you shall become a desolation,\n    and\
      \ you shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Because you cherished an ancient enmity, and gave over the people of Israel
      to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their
      final punishment; '
    6: '⁶ therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will prepare you for blood, and
      blood shall pursue you; since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed shall pursue
      you. '
    7: '⁷ I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation; and I will cut off from
      it all who come and go. '
    8: '⁸ I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys
      and in all your watercourses those killed with the sword shall fall. '
    9: "⁹ I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall never be inhabited.\
      \ Then you shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Because you said, “These two nations and these two countries shall be
      mine, and we will take possession of them,”—although the Lord was there— '
    11: '¹¹ therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will deal with you according
      to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them; and
      I will make myself known among you, when I judge you. '
    12: '¹² You shall know that I, the Lord, have heard all the abusive speech that
      you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, “They are laid desolate,
      they are given us to devour.” '
    13: '¹³ And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied
      your words against me; I heard it. '
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the Lord God: As the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. '
    15: ¹⁵ As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it
      was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and
      all Edom, all of it. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.
  36:
    1: '¹ And you, mortal, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: O mountains
      of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy said of you, “Aha!” and, “The
      ancient heights have become our possession,” '
    3: '³ therefore prophesy, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Because they made you
      desolate indeed, and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession
      of the rest of the nations, and you became an object of gossip and slander among
      the people; '
    4: '⁴ therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says
      the Lord God to the mountains and the hills, the watercourses and the valleys,
      the desolate wastes and the deserted towns, which have become a source of plunder
      and an object of derision to the rest of the nations all around; '
    5: '⁵ therefore thus says the Lord God: I am speaking in my hot jealousy against
      the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who, with wholehearted joy and
      utter contempt, took my land as their possession, because of its pasture, to
      plunder it. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains
      and hills, to the watercourses and valleys, Thus says the Lord God: I am speaking
      in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the insults of the nations; '
    7: "⁷ therefore thus says the Lord God: I swear that the nations that are all\
      \ around you shall themselves suffer insults. \n"
    8: '⁸ But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot out your branches, and yield
      your fruit to my people Israel; for they shall soon come home. '
    9: '⁹ See now, I am for you; I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown; '
    10: '¹⁰ and I will multiply your population, the whole house of Israel, all of
      it; the towns shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt; '
    11: '¹¹ and I will multiply human beings and animals upon you. They shall increase
      and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times,
      and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you shall know that I am
      the Lord. '
    12: "¹² I will lead people upon you—my people Israel—and they shall possess you,\
      \ and you shall be their inheritance. No longer shall you bereave them of children.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Thus says the Lord God: Because they say to you, “You devour people, and
      you bereave your nation of children,” '
    14: '¹⁴ therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your
      nation of children, says the Lord God; '
    15: "¹⁵ and no longer will I let you hear the insults of the nations, no longer\
      \ shall you bear the disgrace of the peoples; and no longer shall you cause\
      \ your nation to stumble, says the Lord God. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    17: '¹⁷ Mortal, when the house of Israel lived on their own soil, they defiled
      it with their ways and their deeds; their conduct in my sight was like the uncleanness
      of a woman in her menstrual period. '
    18: '¹⁸ So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon
      the land, and for the idols with which they had defiled it. '
    19: '¹⁹ I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the
      countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them. '
    20: '²⁰ But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my
      holy name, in that it was said of them, “These are the people of the Lord, and
      yet they had to go out of his land.” '
    21: "²¹ But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned\
      \ among the nations to which they came. \n"
    22: '²² Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not
      for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of
      my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. '
    23: '²³ I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations,
      and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am
      the Lord, says the Lord God, when through you I display my holiness before their
      eyes. '
    24: '²⁴ I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries,
      and bring you into your own land. '
    25: '²⁵ I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all
      your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. '
    26: '²⁶ A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and
      I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. '
    27: '²⁷ I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be
      careful to observe my ordinances. '
    28: '²⁸ Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you
      shall be my people, and I will be your God. '
    29: '²⁹ I will save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will summon the grain
      and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. '
    30: '³⁰ I will make the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field abundant,
      so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. '
    31: '³¹ Then you shall remember your evil ways, and your dealings that were not
      good; and you shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable
      deeds. '
    32: "³² It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord God; let that be\
      \ known to you. Be ashamed and dismayed for your ways, O house of Israel. \n"
    33: '³³ Thus says the Lord God: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities,
      I will cause the towns to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt. '
    34: '³⁴ The land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation
      that it was in the sight of all who passed by. '
    35: '³⁵ And they will say, “This land that was desolate has become like the garden
      of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are now inhabited and fortified.” '
    36: "³⁶ Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord,\
      \ have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I,\
      \ the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Thus says the Lord God: I will also let the house of Israel ask me to
      do this for them: to increase their population like a flock. '
    38: ³⁸ Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed
      festivals, so shall the ruined towns be filled with flocks of people. Then they
      shall know that I am the Lord.
  37:
    1: '¹ The hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of
      the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. '
    2: '² He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and
      they were very dry. '
    3: '³ He said to me, “Mortal, can these bones live?” I answered, “O Lord God,
      you know.” '
    4: '⁴ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones,
      hear the word of the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ Thus says the Lord God to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you,
      and you shall live. '
    6: "⁶ I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover\
      \ you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know\
      \ that I am the Lord.” \n"
    7: '⁷ So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there
      was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. '
    8: '⁸ I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and
      skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. '
    9: '⁹ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to
      the breath: Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O breath, and
      breathe upon these slain, that they may live.” '
    10: "¹⁰ I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they\
      \ lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then he said to me, “Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
      They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: I am going
      to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will
      bring you back to the land of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and bring
      you up from your graves, O my people. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place\
      \ you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken and\
      \ will act, says the Lord.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    16: '¹⁶ Mortal, take a stick and write on it, “For Judah, and the Israelites associated
      with it”; then take another stick and write on it, “For Joseph (the stick of
      Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with it”; '
    17: '¹⁷ and join them together into one stick, so that they may become one in
      your hand. '
    18: '¹⁸ And when your people say to you, “Will you not show us what you mean by
      these?” '
    19: '¹⁹ say to them, Thus says the Lord God: I am about to take the stick of Joseph
      (which is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with it;
      and I will put the stick of Judah upon it, and make them one stick, in order
      that they may be one in my hand. '
    20: '²⁰ When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, '
    21: '²¹ then say to them, Thus says the Lord God: I will take the people of Israel
      from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from every
      quarter, and bring them to their own land. '
    22: '²² I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and
      one king shall be king over them all. Never again shall they be two nations,
      and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms. '
    23: "²³ They shall never again defile themselves with their idols and their detestable\
      \ things, or with any of their transgressions. I will save them from all the\
      \ apostasies into which they have fallen, and will cleanse them. Then they shall\
      \ be my people, and I will be their God. \n"
    24: '²⁴ My servant David shall be king over them; and they shall all have one
      shepherd. They shall follow my ordinances and be careful to observe my statutes. '
    25: '²⁵ They shall live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, in which
      your ancestors lived; they and their children and their children’s children
      shall live there forever; and my servant David shall be their prince forever. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting
      covenant with them; and I will bless them and multiply them, and will set my
      sanctuary among them forevermore. '
    27: '²⁷ My dwelling place shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they
      shall be my people. '
    28: ²⁸ Then the nations shall know that I the Lord sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary
      is among them forevermore.
  38:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² Mortal, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince
      of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him '
    3: '³ and say: Thus says the Lord God: I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of
      Meshech and Tubal; '
    4: '⁴ I will turn you around and put hooks into your jaws, and I will lead you
      out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor,
      a great company, all of them with shield and buckler, wielding swords. '
    5: '⁵ Persia, Ethiopia, and Put are with them, all of them with buckler and helmet; '
    6: "⁶ Gomer and all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remotest parts of the north\
      \ with all its troops—many peoples are with you. \n"
    7: '⁷ Be ready and keep ready, you and all the companies that are assembled around
      you, and hold yourselves in reserve for them. '
    8: '⁸ After many days you shall be mustered; in the latter years you shall go
      against a land restored from war, a land where people were gathered from many
      nations on the mountains of Israel, which had long lain waste; its people were
      brought out from the nations and now are living in safety, all of them. '
    9: "⁹ You shall advance, coming on like a storm; you shall be like a cloud covering\
      \ the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Thus says the Lord God: On that day thoughts will come into your mind,
      and you will devise an evil scheme. '
    11: '¹¹ You will say, “I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will
      fall upon the quiet people who live in safety, all of them living without walls,
      and having no bars or gates”; '
    12: '¹² to seize spoil and carry off plunder; to assail the waste places that
      are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who are
      acquiring cattle and goods, who live at the center of the earth. '
    13: "¹³ Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its young warriors\
      \ will say to you, “Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your horde\
      \ to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and\
      \ goods, to seize a great amount of booty?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore, mortal, prophesy, and say to Gog: Thus says the Lord God: On
      that day when my people Israel are living securely, you will rouse yourself '
    15: '¹⁵ and come from your place out of the remotest parts of the north, you and
      many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty
      army; '
    16: "¹⁶ you will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the earth.\
      \ In the latter days I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may\
      \ know me, when through you, O Gog, I display my holiness before their eyes.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Thus says the Lord God: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my
      servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that
      I would bring you against them? '
    18: '¹⁸ On that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord
      God, my wrath shall be aroused. '
    19: '¹⁹ For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare: On that day there
      shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; '
    20: '²⁰ the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the animals of the
      field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all human beings
      that are on the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence, and the mountains
      shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble
      to the ground. '
    21: '²¹ I will summon the sword against Gog in all my mountains, says the Lord
      God; the swords of all will be against their comrades. '
    22: '²² With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him; and
      I will pour down torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur, upon him
      and his troops and the many peoples that are with him. '
    23: ²³ So I will display my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in
      the eyes of many nations. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.
  39:
    1: '¹ And you, mortal, prophesy against Gog, and say: Thus says the Lord God:
      I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal! '
    2: '² I will turn you around and drive you forward, and bring you up from the
      remotest parts of the north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel. '
    3: '³ I will strike your bow from your left hand, and will make your arrows drop
      out of your right hand. '
    4: '⁴ You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the
      peoples that are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every kind and
      to the wild animals to be devoured. '
    5: '⁵ You shall fall in the open field; for I have spoken, says the Lord God. '
    6: "⁶ I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the coastlands;\
      \ and they shall know that I am the Lord. \n"
    7: '⁷ My holy name I will make known among my people Israel; and I will not let
      my holy name be profaned any more; and the nations shall know that I am the
      Lord, the Holy One in Israel. '
    8: "⁸ It has come! It has happened, says the Lord God. This is the day of which\
      \ I have spoken. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and make fires of
      the weapons and burn them—bucklers and shields, bows and arrows, handpikes and
      spears—and they will make fires of them for seven years. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any trees\
      \ in the forests, for they will make their fires of the weapons; they will despoil\
      \ those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, says the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    11: '¹¹ On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley
      of the Travelers east of the sea; it shall block the path of the travelers,
      for there Gog and all his horde will be buried; it shall be called the Valley
      of Hamon-gog. '
    12: '¹² Seven months the house of Israel shall spend burying them, in order to
      cleanse the land. '
    13: '¹³ All the people of the land shall bury them; and it will bring them honor
      on the day that I show my glory, says the Lord God. '
    14: '¹⁴ They will set apart men to pass through the land regularly and bury any
      invaders who remain on the face of the land, so as to cleanse it; for seven
      months they shall make their search. '
    15: '¹⁵ As the searchers pass through the land, anyone who sees a human bone shall
      set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog. '
    16: "¹⁶ (A city Hamonah is there also.) Thus they shall cleanse the land. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ As for you, mortal, thus says the Lord God: Speak to the birds of every
      kind and to all the wild animals: Assemble and come, gather from all around
      to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast
      on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes
      of the earth—of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings
      of Bashan. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall eat fat until you are filled, and drink blood until you are
      drunk, at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you. '
    20: "²⁰ And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with\
      \ warriors and all kinds of soldiers, says the Lord God. \n"
    21: '²¹ I will display my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see
      my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them. '
    22: '²² The house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from that
      day forward. '
    23: '²³ And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity
      for their iniquity, because they dealt treacherously with me. So I hid my face
      from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell
      by the sword. '
    24: "²⁴ I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions,\
      \ and hid my face from them. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Therefore thus says the Lord God: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob,
      and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy
      name. '
    26: '²⁶ They shall forget their shame, and all the treachery they have practiced
      against me, when they live securely in their land with no one to make them afraid, '
    27: '²⁷ when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from
      their enemies’ lands, and through them have displayed my holiness in the sight
      of many nations. '
    28: '²⁸ Then they shall know that I am the Lord their God because I sent them
      into exile among the nations, and then gathered them into their own land. I
      will leave none of them behind; '
    29: ²⁹ and I will never again hide my face from them, when I pour out my spirit
      upon the house of Israel, says the Lord God.
  40:
    1: '¹ In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on
      the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck
      down, on that very day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me
      there. '
    2: '² He brought me, in visions of God, to the land of Israel, and set me down
      upon a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south. '
    3: '³ When he brought me there, a man was there, whose appearance shone like bronze,
      with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand; and he was standing in the
      gateway. '
    4: "⁴ The man said to me, “Mortal, look closely and listen attentively, and set\
      \ your mind upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order\
      \ that I might show it to you; declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area. The length
      of the measuring reed in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit
      and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed;
      and the height, one reed. '
    6: '⁶ Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured
      the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. There were '
    7: '⁷ recesses, and each recess was one reed wide and one reed deep; and the space
      between the recesses, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule
      of the gate at the inner end was one reed deep. '
    8: '⁸ Then he measured the inner vestibule of the gateway, one cubit. '
    9: '⁹ Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its pilasters,
      two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end. '
    10: '¹⁰ There were three recesses on either side of the east gate; the three were
      of the same size; and the pilasters on either side were of the same size. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits;
      and the width of the gateway, thirteen cubits. '
    12: '¹² There was a barrier before the recesses, one cubit on either side; and
      the recesses were six cubits on either side. '
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the gate from the back of the one recess to the back
      of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, from wall to wall. '
    14: '¹⁴ He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and the gate next to the
      pilaster on every side of the court. '
    15: '¹⁵ From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule
      of the gate was fifty cubits. '
    16: "¹⁶ The recesses and their pilasters had windows, with shutters on the inside\
      \ of the gateway all around, and the vestibules also had windows on the inside\
      \ all around; and on the pilasters were palm trees. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then he brought me into the outer court; there were chambers there, and
      a pavement, all around the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement. '
    18: '¹⁸ The pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length
      of the gates; this was the lower pavement. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to\
      \ the outer front of the inner court, one hundred cubits. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he measured the gate of the outer court that faced north—its depth
      and width. '
    21: '²¹ Its recesses, three on either side, and its pilasters and its vestibule
      were of the same size as those of the first gate; its depth was fifty cubits,
      and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    22: '²² Its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as
      those of the gate that faced toward the east. Seven steps led up to it; and
      its vestibule was on the inside. '
    23: "²³ Opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner\
      \ court; he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then he led me toward the south, and there was a gate on the south; and
      he measured its pilasters and its vestibule; they had the same dimensions as
      the others. '
    25: '²⁵ There were windows all around in it and in its vestibule, like the windows
      of the others; its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    26: '²⁶ There were seven steps leading up to it; its vestibule was on the inside.
      It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on either side. '
    27: "²⁷ There was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from\
      \ gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured
      the south gate; it was of the same dimensions as the others. '
    29: '²⁹ Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as
      the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule; its
      depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    30: '³⁰ There were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits deep and five cubits
      wide. '
    31: "³¹ Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pilasters,\
      \ and its stairway had eight steps. \n"
    32: '³² Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured
      the gate; it was of the same size as the others. '
    33: '³³ Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same dimensions
      as the others; and there were windows all around in it and in its vestibule;
      its depth was fifty cubits, and its width twenty-five cubits. '
    34: "³⁴ Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters,\
      \ on either side; and its stairway had eight steps. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same
      dimensions as the others. '
    36: '³⁶ Its recesses, its pilasters, and its vestibule were of the same size as
      the others; and it had windows all around. Its depth was fifty cubits, and its
      width twenty-five cubits. '
    37: "³⁷ Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its pilasters,\
      \ on either side; and its stairway had eight steps. \n"
    38: '³⁸ There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where
      the burnt offering was to be washed. '
    39: '³⁹ And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which
      the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On the outside of the vestibule at the entrance of the north gate were
      two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables. '
    41: '⁴¹ Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the
      side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. '
    42: '⁴² There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit
      and a half long, and one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which
      the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices
      were slaughtered. '
    43: "⁴³ There were pegs, one handbreadth long, fastened all around the inside.\
      \ And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ On the outside of the inner gateway there were chambers for the singers
      in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other
      at the side of the east gate facing north. '
    45: '⁴⁵ He said to me, “This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have
      charge of the temple, '
    46: '⁴⁶ and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of
      the altar; these are the descendants of Zadok, who alone among the descendants
      of Levi may come near to the Lord to minister to him.” '
    47: "⁴⁷ He measured the court, one hundred cubits deep, and one hundred cubits\
      \ wide, a square; and the altar was in front of the temple. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the pilasters
      of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the width of the gate was
      fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side. '
    49: ⁴⁹ The depth of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width twelve cubits;
      ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars beside the pilasters on either
      side.
  41:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me to the nave, and measured the pilasters; on each side
      six cubits was the width of the pilasters. '
    2: '² The width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance
      were five cubits on either side. He measured the length of the nave, forty cubits,
      and its width, twenty cubits. '
    3: '³ Then he went into the inner room and measured the pilasters of the entrance,
      two cubits; and the width of the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls of
      the entrance, seven cubits. '
    4: "⁴ He measured the depth of the room, twenty cubits, and its width, twenty\
      \ cubits, beyond the nave. And he said to me, This is the most holy place. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick; and the width
      of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple. '
    6: '⁶ The side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each
      story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports
      for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the
      temple. '
    7: '⁷ The passageway of the side chambers widened from story to story; for the
      structure was supplied with a stairway all around the temple. For this reason
      the structure became wider from story to story. One ascended from the bottom
      story to the uppermost story by way of the middle one. '
    8: '⁸ I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations
      of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits. '
    9: '⁹ The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits; and
      the free space between the side chambers of the temple '
    10: '¹⁰ and the chambers of the court was a width of twenty cubits all around
      the temple on every side. '
    11: "¹¹ The side chambers opened onto the area left free, one door toward the\
      \ north, and another door toward the south; and the width of the part that was\
      \ left free was five cubits all around. \n"
    12: "¹² The building that was facing the temple yard on the west side was seventy\
      \ cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around,\
      \ and its depth ninety cubits. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the temple, one hundred cubits deep; and the yard and
      the building with its walls, one hundred cubits deep; '
    14: "¹⁴ also the width of the east front of the temple and the yard, one hundred\
      \ cubits. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then he measured the depth of the building facing the yard at the west,\
      \ together with its galleries on either side, one hundred cubits.\nThe nave\
      \ of the temple and the inner room and the outer vestibule "
    16: '¹⁶ were paneled, and, all around, all three had windows with recessed frames.
      Facing the threshold the temple was paneled with wood all around, from the floor
      up to the windows (now the windows were covered), '
    17: '¹⁷ to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside.
      And on all the walls all around in the inner room and the nave there was a pattern. '
    18: '¹⁸ It was formed of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and
      cherub. Each cherub had two faces: '
    19: '¹⁹ a human face turned toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face
      of a young lion turned toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved
      on the whole temple all around; '
    20: "²⁰ from the floor to the area above the door, cherubim and palm trees were\
      \ carved on the wall. \n"
    21: '²¹ The doorposts of the nave were square. In front of the holy place was
      something resembling '
    22: '²² an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits wide;
      its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the
      table that stands before the Lord.” '
    23: '²³ The nave and the holy place had each a double door. '
    24: '²⁴ The doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door. '
    25: '²⁵ On the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as
      were carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule
      outside. '
    26: ²⁶ And there were recessed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls
      of the vestibule.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought
      me to the chambers that were opposite the temple yard and opposite the building
      on the north. '
    2: '² The length of the building that was on the north side was one hundred cubits,
      and the width fifty cubits. '
    3: '³ Across the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the
      pavement that belonged to the outer court, the chambers rose gallery by gallery
      in three stories. '
    4: '⁴ In front of the chambers was a passage on the inner side, ten cubits wide
      and one hundred cubits deep, and its entrances were on the north. '
    5: '⁵ Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from
      them than from the lower and middle chambers in the building. '
    6: '⁶ For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars
      of the outer court; for this reason the upper chambers were set back from the
      ground more than the lower and the middle ones. '
    7: '⁷ There was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court,
      opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long. '
    8: '⁸ For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those
      opposite the temple were one hundred cubits long. '
    9: '⁹ At the foot of these chambers ran a passage that one entered from the east
      in order to enter them from the outer court. '
    10: "¹⁰ The width of the passage was fixed by the wall of the court.\nOn the south\
      \ also, opposite the vacant area and opposite the building, there were chambers "
    11: '¹¹ with a passage in front of them; they were similar to the chambers on
      the north, of the same length and width, with the same exits and arrangements
      and doors. '
    12: "¹² So the entrances of the chambers to the south were entered through the\
      \ entrance at the head of the corresponding passage, from the east, along the\
      \ matching wall. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers opposite
      the vacant area are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the Lord
      shall eat the most holy offerings; there they shall deposit the most holy offerings—the
      grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for the place is holy. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the priests enter the holy place, they shall not go out of it into\
      \ the outer court without laying there the vestments in which they minister,\
      \ for these are holy; they shall put on other garments before they go near to\
      \ the area open to the people.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led
      me out by the gate that faces east, and measured the temple area all around. '
    16: '¹⁶ He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred cubits
      by the measuring reed. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then he turned and measured the north side, five hundred cubits by the
      measuring reed. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then he turned and measured the south side, five hundred cubits by the
      measuring reed. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then he turned to the west side and measured, five hundred cubits by the
      measuring reed. '
    20: ²⁰ He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred
      cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to make a separation between the holy
      and the common.
  43:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me to the gate, the gate facing east. '
    2: '² And there, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east; the
      sound was like the sound of mighty waters; and the earth shone with his glory. '
    3: '³ The vision I saw was like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy
      the city, and like the vision that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell
      upon my face. '
    4: '⁴ As the glory of the Lord entered the temple by the gate facing east, '
    5: "⁵ the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and the glory\
      \ of the Lord filled the temple. \n"
    6: '⁶ While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me out
      of the temple. '
    7: '⁷ He said to me: Mortal, this is the place of my throne and the place for
      the soles of my feet, where I will reside among the people of Israel forever.
      The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their
      kings, by their whoring, and by the corpses of their kings at their death. '
    8: '⁸ When they placed their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside
      my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they were defiling my holy
      name by their abominations that they committed; therefore I have consumed them
      in my anger. '
    9: "⁹ Now let them put away their idolatry and the corpses of their kings far\
      \ from me, and I will reside among them forever. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As for you, mortal, describe the temple to the house of Israel, and let
      them measure the pattern; and let them be ashamed of their iniquities. '
    11: '¹¹ When they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the
      plan of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, and its whole
      form—all its ordinances and its entire plan and all its laws; and write it down
      in their sight, so that they may observe and follow the entire plan and all
      its ordinances. '
    12: "¹² This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain\
      \ all around shall be most holy. This is the law of the temple. \n"
    13: '¹³ These are the dimensions of the altar by cubits (the cubit being one cubit
      and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high, and one cubit wide, with
      a rim of one span around its edge. This shall be the height of the altar: '
    14: '¹⁴ From the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a width
      of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with
      a width of one cubit; '
    15: '¹⁵ and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting
      upward, four horns. '
    16: '¹⁶ The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve wide. '
    17: "¹⁷ The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide,\
      \ with a rim around it half a cubit wide, and its surrounding base, one cubit.\
      \ Its steps shall face east. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he said to me: Mortal, thus says the Lord God: These are the ordinances
      for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon
      it and for dashing blood against it, '
    19: '¹⁹ you shall give to the levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw
      near to me to minister to me, says the Lord God, a bull for a sin offering. '
    20: '²⁰ And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of
      the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim all around;
      thus you shall purify it and make atonement for it. '
    21: "²¹ You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt\
      \ in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area. \n"
    22: '²² On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin
      offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull. '
    23: '²³ When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a bull without blemish
      and a ram from the flock without blemish. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt
      on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ For seven days you shall provide daily a goat for a sin offering; also
      a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided. '
    26: '²⁶ Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and
      so consecrate it. '
    27: ²⁷ When these days are over, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall
      offer upon the altar your burnt offerings and your offerings of well-being;
      and I will accept you, says the Lord God.
  44:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces
      east; and it was shut. '
    2: '² The Lord said to me: This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened,
      and no one shall enter by it; for the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered by
      it; therefore it shall remain shut. '
    3: "³ Only the prince, because he is a prince, may sit in it to eat food before\
      \ the Lord; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go\
      \ out by the same way. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple;
      and I looked, and lo! the glory of the Lord filled the temple of the Lord; and
      I fell upon my face. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to me: Mortal, mark well, look closely, and listen attentively
      to all that I shall tell you concerning all the ordinances of the temple of
      the Lord and all its laws; and mark well those who may be admitted to the temple
      and all those who are to be excluded from the sanctuary. '
    6: '⁶ Say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord
      God: O house of Israel, let there be an end to all your abominations '
    7: '⁷ in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary,
      profaning my temple when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You
      have broken my covenant with all your abominations. '
    8: "⁸ And you have not kept charge of my sacred offerings; but you have appointed\
      \ foreigners to act for you in keeping my charge in my sanctuary. \n"
    9: '⁹ Thus says the Lord God: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh,
      of all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, shall enter my sanctuary. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their
      idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment. '
    11: '¹¹ They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates
      of the temple, and serving in the temple; they shall slaughter the burnt offering
      and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall attend on them and serve them. '
    12: '¹² Because they ministered to them before their idols and made the house
      of Israel stumble into iniquity, therefore I have sworn concerning them, says
      the Lord God, that they shall bear their punishment. '
    13: '¹³ They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any
      of my sacred offerings, the things that are most sacred; but they shall bear
      their shame, and the consequences of the abominations that they have committed. '
    14: "¹⁴ Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its chores,\
      \ all that is to be done in it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But the levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept the charge
      of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near
      to me to minister to me; and they shall attend me to offer me the fat and the
      blood, says the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ It is they who shall enter my sanctuary, it is they who shall approach
      my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge. '
    17: '¹⁷ When they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen vestments;
      they shall have nothing of wool on them, while they minister at the gates of
      the inner court, and within. '
    18: '¹⁸ They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and linen undergarments
      on their loins; they shall not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat. '
    19: '¹⁹ When they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall remove
      the vestments in which they have been ministering, and lay them in the holy
      chambers; and they shall put on other garments, so that they may not communicate
      holiness to the people with their vestments. '
    20: '²⁰ They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall
      only trim the hair of their heads. '
    21: '²¹ No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court. '
    22: '²² They shall not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, but only a virgin of
      the stock of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. '
    23: '²³ They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common,
      and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean. '
    24: '²⁴ In a controversy they shall act as judges, and they shall decide it according
      to my judgments. They shall keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my appointed
      festivals, and they shall keep my sabbaths holy. '
    25: '²⁵ They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person; for father
      or mother, however, and for son or daughter, and for brother or unmarried sister
      they may defile themselves. '
    26: '²⁶ After he has become clean, they shall count seven days for him. '
    27: "²⁷ On the day that he goes into the holy place, into the inner court, to\
      \ minister in the holy place, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    28: '²⁸ This shall be their inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you shall
      give them no holding in Israel; I am their holding. '
    29: '²⁹ They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering;
      and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. '
    30: '³⁰ The first of all the first fruits of all kinds, and every offering of
      all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests; you shall also
      give to the priests the first of your dough, in order that a blessing may rest
      on your house. '
    31: ³¹ The priests shall not eat of anything, whether bird or animal, that died
      of itself or was torn by animals.
  45:
    1: '¹ When you allot the land as an inheritance, you shall set aside for the Lord
      a portion of the land as a holy district, twenty-five thousand cubits long and
      twenty thousand cubits wide; it shall be holy throughout its entire extent. '
    2: '² Of this, a square plot of five hundred by five hundred cubits shall be for
      the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it. '
    3: '³ In the holy district you shall measure off a section twenty-five thousand
      cubits long and ten thousand wide, in which shall be the sanctuary, the most
      holy place. '
    4: '⁴ It shall be a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, who
      minister in the sanctuary and approach the Lord to minister to him; and it shall
      be both a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. '
    5: "⁵ Another section, twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits\
      \ wide, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their holding\
      \ for cities to live in. \n"
    6: "⁶ Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign as\
      \ a holding for the city an area five thousand cubits wide, and twenty-five\
      \ thousand cubits long; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel. \n"
    7: '⁷ And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district
      and the holding of the city, alongside the holy district and the holding of
      the city, on the west and on the east, corresponding in length to one of the
      tribal portions, and extending from the western to the eastern boundary '
    8: "⁸ of the land. It is to be his property in Israel. And my princes shall no\
      \ longer oppress my people; but they shall let the house of Israel have the\
      \ land according to their tribes. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord God: Enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and\
      \ oppression, and do what is just and right. Cease your evictions of my people,\
      \ says the Lord God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ You shall have honest balances, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. '
    11: '¹¹ The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, the bath containing
      one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; the homer shall be
      the standard measure. '
    12: "¹² The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels,\
      \ and fifteen shekels shall make a mina for you. \n"
    13: '¹³ This is the offering that you shall make: one-sixth of an ephah from each
      homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley, '
    14: '¹⁴ and as the fixed portion of oil, one-tenth of a bath from each cor (the
      cor, like the homer, contains ten baths); '
    15: '¹⁵ and one sheep from every flock of two hundred, from the pastures of Israel.
      This is the offering for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and offerings of
      well-being, to make atonement for them, says the Lord God. '
    16: '¹⁶ All the people of the land shall join with the prince in Israel in making
      this offering. '
    17: "¹⁷ But this shall be the obligation of the prince regarding the burnt offerings,\
      \ grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the festivals, the new moons, and\
      \ the sabbaths, all the appointed festivals of the house of Israel: he shall\
      \ provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, the burnt offerings, and the offerings\
      \ of well-being, to make atonement for the house of Israel. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Thus says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month,
      you shall take a young bull without blemish, and purify the sanctuary. '
    19: '¹⁹ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it
      on the doorposts of the temple, the four corners of the ledge of the altar,
      and the posts of the gate of the inner court. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has\
      \ sinned through error or ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the temple.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall celebrate
      the festival of the passover, and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten. '
    22: '²² On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of
      the land a young bull for a sin offering. '
    23: '²³ And during the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt
      offering to the Lord seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish, on each
      of the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering. '
    24: '²⁴ He shall provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah
      for each ram, and a hin of oil to each ephah. '
    25: ²⁵ In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven
      days of the festival, he shall make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt
      offerings, and grain offerings, and for the oil.
  46:
    1: '¹ Thus says the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall
      remain closed on the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened
      and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. '
    2: '² The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from outside, and shall
      take his stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering
      and his offerings of well-being, and he shall bow down at the threshold of the
      gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be closed until evening. '
    3: '³ The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before
      the Lord on the sabbaths and on the new moons. '
    4: '⁴ The burnt offering that the prince offers to the Lord on the sabbath day
      shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; '
    5: '⁵ and the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering
      with the lambs shall be as much as he wishes to give, together with a hin of
      oil to each ephah. '
    6: '⁶ On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish,
      and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish; '
    7: '⁷ as a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah
      with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wishes, together with a hin of
      oil to each ephah. '
    8: "⁸ When the prince enters, he shall come in by the vestibule of the gate, and\
      \ he shall go out by the same way. \n"
    9: '⁹ When the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed festivals,
      whoever enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate;
      and whoever enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: they shall
      not return by way of the gate by which they entered, but shall go out straight
      ahead. '
    10: "¹⁰ When they come in, the prince shall come in with them; and when they go\
      \ out, he shall go out. \n"
    11: '¹¹ At the festivals and the appointed seasons the grain offering with a young
      bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much
      as one wishes to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah. '
    12: "¹² When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering\
      \ or offerings of well-being as a freewill offering to the Lord, the gate facing\
      \ east shall be opened for him; and he shall offer his burnt offering or his\
      \ offerings of well-being as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out,\
      \ and after he has gone out the gate shall be closed. \n"
    13: '¹³ He shall provide a lamb, a yearling, without blemish, for a burnt offering
      to the Lord daily; morning by morning he shall provide it. '
    14: '¹⁴ And he shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning regularly,
      one-sixth of an ephah, and one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the choice flour,
      as a grain offering to the Lord; this is the ordinance for all time. '
    15: "¹⁵ Thus the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided, morning\
      \ by morning, as a regular burnt offering. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Thus says the Lord God: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons
      out of his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons, it is their holding by
      inheritance. '
    17: '¹⁷ But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants,
      it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince;
      only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance. '
    18: "¹⁸ The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting\
      \ them out of their holding; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of\
      \ his own holding, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of their\
      \ holding. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the
      gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw
      a place at the extreme western end of them. '
    20: "²⁰ He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt\
      \ offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering,\
      \ in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness\
      \ to the people.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then he brought me out to the outer court, and led me past the four corners
      of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court— '
    22: '²² in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long
      and thirty wide; the four were of the same size. '
    23: '²³ On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with
      hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around. '
    24: ²⁴ Then he said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who serve at the
      temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”
  47:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple; there, water was
      flowing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple
      faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the south end of the
      threshold of the temple, south of the altar. '
    2: "² Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the\
      \ outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and the water was coming\
      \ out on the south side. \n"
    3: '³ Going on eastward with a cord in his hand, the man measured one thousand
      cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep. '
    4: '⁴ Again he measured one thousand, and led me through the water; and it was
      knee-deep. Again he measured one thousand, and led me through the water; and
      it was up to the waist. '
    5: '⁵ Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross,
      for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not
      be crossed. '
    6: "⁶ He said to me, “Mortal, have you seen this?”\nThen he led me back along\
      \ the bank of the river. "
    7: '⁷ As I came back, I saw on the bank of the river a great many trees on the
      one side and on the other. '
    8: '⁸ He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down
      into the Arabah; and when it enters the sea, the sea of stagnant waters, the
      water will become fresh. '
    9: '⁹ Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and
      there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there. It will become
      fresh; and everything will live where the river goes. '
    10: '¹⁰ People will stand fishing beside the sea from En-gedi to En-eglaim; it
      will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of a great many
      kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. '
    11: '¹¹ But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left
      for salt. '
    12: "¹² On the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of\
      \ trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they\
      \ will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the\
      \ sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Thus says the Lord God: These are the boundaries by which you shall divide
      the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have
      two portions. '
    14: "¹⁴ You shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your ancestors, and\
      \ this land shall fall to you as your inheritance. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great
      Sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to Zedad, '
    16: '¹⁶ Berothah, Sibraim (which lies between the border of Damascus and the border
      of Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. '
    17: "¹⁷ So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enon, which is north of\
      \ the border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall\
      \ be the north side. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ On the east side, between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between\
      \ Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This\
      \ shall be the east side. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh,\
      \ from there along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south\
      \ side. \n"
    20: "²⁰ On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite\
      \ Lebo-hamath. This shall be the west side. \n"
    21: '²¹ So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel. '
    22: '²² You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens
      who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to
      you as citizens of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among
      the tribes of Israel. '
    23: ²³ In whatever tribe aliens reside, there you shall assign them their inheritance,

  48:
    1: '¹ These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern border, on

    2: '² Adjoining the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher, one
