    30: '³⁰ Others, of the sons of the priests, prepared the mixing of the spices, '
    31: '³¹ and Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite,
      was in charge of making the flat cakes. '
    32: "³² Also some of their kindred of the Kohathites had charge of the rows of\
      \ bread, to prepare them for each sabbath. \n"
    33: '³³ Now these are the singers, the heads of ancestral houses of the Levites,
      living in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were
      on duty day and night. '
    34: "³⁴ These were heads of ancestral houses of the Levites, according to their\
      \ generations; these leaders lived in Jerusalem. \n"
    35: '³⁵ In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife
      was Maacah. '
    36: '³⁶ His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, '
    37: '³⁷ Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth; '
    38: '³⁸ and Mikloth became the father of Shimeam; and these also lived opposite
      their kindred in Jerusalem, with their kindred. '
    39: '³⁹ Ner became the father of Kish, Kish of Saul, Saul of Jonathan, Malchishua,
      Abinadab, and Esh-baal; '
    40: '⁴⁰ and the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal became the father
      of Micah. '
    41: '⁴¹ The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz; '
    42: '⁴² and Ahaz became the father of Jarah, and Jarah of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and
      Zimri; and Zimri became the father of Moza. '
    43: '⁴³ Moza became the father of Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his
      son, Azel his son. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael,
      Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.'
  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before
      the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan
      and Abinadab and Malchishua, sons of Saul. '
    3: '³ The battle pressed hard on Saul; and the archers found him, and he was wounded
      by the archers. '
    4: '⁴ Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through
      with it, so that these uncircumcised may not come and make sport of me.” But
      his armor-bearer was unwilling, for he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword
      and fell on it. '
    5: '⁵ When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword
      and died. '
    6: '⁶ Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together. '
    7: "⁷ When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had\
      \ fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and\
      \ fled; and the Philistines came and occupied them. \n"
    8: '⁸ The next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul
      and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout
      the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the
      people. '
    10: '¹⁰ They put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head
      in the temple of Dagon. '
    11: '¹¹ But when all Jabesh-gilead heard everything that the Philistines had done
      to Saul, '
    12: "¹² all the valiant warriors got up and took away the body of Saul and the\
      \ bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones\
      \ under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in
      that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had consulted a medium,
      seeking guidance, '
    14: ¹⁴ and did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to
      death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, “See, we
      are your bone and flesh. '
    2: '² For some time now, even while Saul was king, it was you who commanded the
      army of Israel. The Lord your God said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd
      of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over my people Israel.” '
    3: "³ So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a\
      \ covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king\
      \ over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ David and all Israel marched to Jerusalem, that is Jebus, where the Jebusites
      were, the inhabitants of the land. '
    5: '⁵ The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless
      David took the stronghold of Zion, now the city of David. '
    6: '⁶ David had said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and
      commander.” And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. '
    7: '⁷ David resided in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. '
    8: '⁸ He built the city all around, from the Millo in complete circuit; and Joab
      repaired the rest of the city. '
    9: "⁹ And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts was with him.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now these are the chiefs of David’s warriors, who gave him strong support
      in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the
      word of the Lord concerning Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ This is an account of David’s mighty warriors: Jashobeam, son of Hachmoni,\
      \ was chief of the Three; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he\
      \ killed at one time. \n"
    12: '¹² And next to him among the three warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo, the
      Ahohite. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there
      for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley. Now the people had fled
      from the Philistines, '
    14: "¹⁴ but he and David took their stand in the middle of the plot, defended\
      \ it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord saved them by a great victory.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David at the cave
      of Adullam, while the army of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. '
    16: '¹⁶ David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines
      was then at Bethlehem. '
    17: '¹⁷ David said longingly, “O that someone would give me water to drink from
      the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then the Three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water
      from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and they brought it to David.
      But David would not drink of it; he poured it out to the Lord, '
    19: "¹⁹ and said, “My God forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood\
      \ of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he\
      \ would not drink it. The three warriors did these things. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Thirty. With his spear
      he fought against three hundred and killed them, and won a name beside the Three. '
    21: "²¹ He was the most renowned of the Thirty, and became their commander; but\
      \ he did not attain to the Three. \n"
    22: '²² Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great
      deeds; he struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed
      a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. '
    23: '²³ And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The
      Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver’s beam; but Benaiah went against
      him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed
      him with his own spear. '
    24: '²⁴ Such were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and he won a name beside
      the three warriors. '
    25: "²⁵ He was renowned among the Thirty, but he did not attain to the Three.\
      \ And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The warriors of the armies were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan son of
      Dodo of Bethlehem, '
    27: '²⁷ Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pelonite, '
    28: '²⁸ Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, Abiezer of Anathoth, '
    29: '²⁹ Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, '
    30: '³⁰ Maharai of Netophah, Heled son of Baanah of Netophah, '
    31: '³¹ Ithai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah of Pirathon, '
    32: '³² Hurai of the wadis of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, '
    33: '³³ Azmaveth of Baharum, Eliahba of Shaalbon, '
    34: '³⁴ Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite, '
    35: '³⁵ Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur, '
    36: '³⁶ Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, '
    37: '³⁷ Hezro of Carmel, Naarai son of Ezbai, '
    38: '³⁸ Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri, '
    39: '³⁹ Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab son of
      Zeruiah, '
    40: '⁴⁰ Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, '
    41: '⁴¹ Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai, '
    42: '⁴² Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty
      with him, '
    43: '⁴³ Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, '
    44: '⁴⁴ Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham the Aroerite, '
    45: '⁴⁵ Jediael son of Shimri, and his brother Joha the Tizite, '
    46: '⁴⁶ Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah
      the Moabite, '
    47: ⁴⁷ Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
  12:
    1: '¹ The following are those who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not
      move about freely because of Saul son of Kish; they were among the mighty warriors
      who helped him in war. '
    2: '² They were archers, and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the
      right hand or the left; they were Benjaminites, Saul’s kindred. '
    3: '³ The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; also
      Jeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of Anathoth, '
    4: '⁴ Ishmaiah of Gibeon, a warrior among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty;
      Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad of Gederah, '
    5: '⁵ Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite; '
    6: '⁶ Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; '
    7: "⁷ and Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor. \n"
    8: '⁸ From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness
      mighty and experienced warriors, expert with shield and spear, whose faces were
      like the faces of lions, and who were swift as gazelles on the mountains: '
    9: '⁹ Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, '
    10: '¹⁰ Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, '
    11: '¹¹ Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, '
    12: '¹² Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, '
    13: '¹³ Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh. '
    14: '¹⁴ These Gadites were officers of the army, the least equal to a hundred
      and the greatest to a thousand. '
    15: "¹⁵ These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was\
      \ overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to\
      \ the east and to the west. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Some Benjaminites and Judahites came to the stronghold to David. '
    17: '¹⁷ David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me
      in friendship, to help me, then my heart will be knit to you; but if you have
      come to betray me to my adversaries, though my hands have done no wrong, then
      may the God of our ancestors see and give judgment.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said,\n\
      “We are yours, O David;\n    and with you, O son of Jesse!\nPeace, peace to\
      \ you,\n    and peace to the one who helps you!\n    For your God is the one\
      \ who helps you.”\nThen David received them, and made them officers of his troops.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Some of the Manassites deserted to David when he came with the Philistines
      for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the
      Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, “He will desert to his master
      Saul at the cost of our heads.”) '
    20: '²⁰ As he went to Ziklag these Manassites deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad,
      Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of the thousands in
      Manasseh. '
    21: '²¹ They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all warriors
      and commanders in the army. '
    22: "²² Indeed from day to day people kept coming to David to help him, until\
      \ there was a great army, like an army of God. \n"
    23: '²³ These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to
      David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word
      of the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ The people of Judah bearing shield and spear numbered six thousand eight
      hundred armed troops. '
    25: '²⁵ Of the Simeonites, mighty warriors, seven thousand one hundred. '
    26: '²⁶ Of the Levites four thousand six hundred. '
    27: '²⁷ Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven
      hundred. '
    28: '²⁸ Zadok, a young warrior, and twenty-two commanders from his own ancestral
      house. '
    29: '²⁹ Of the Benjaminites, the kindred of Saul, three thousand, of whom the
      majority had continued to keep their allegiance to the house of Saul. '
    30: '³⁰ Of the Ephraimites, twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty warriors, notables
      in their ancestral houses. '
    31: '³¹ Of the half-tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, who were expressly named
      to come and make David king. '
    32: '³² Of Issachar, those who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel
      ought to do, two hundred chiefs, and all their kindred under their command. '
    33: '³³ Of Zebulun, fifty thousand seasoned troops, equipped for battle with all
      the weapons of war, to help David with singleness of purpose. '
    34: '³⁴ Of Naphtali, a thousand commanders, with whom there were thirty-seven
      thousand armed with shield and spear. '
    35: '³⁵ Of the Danites, twenty-eight thousand six hundred equipped for battle. '
    36: '³⁶ Of Asher, forty thousand seasoned troops ready for battle. '
    37: "³⁷ Of the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh from beyond\
      \ the Jordan, one hundred twenty thousand armed with all the weapons of war.\
      \ \n"
    38: '³⁸ All these, warriors arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with full
      intent to make David king over all Israel; likewise all the rest of Israel were
      of a single mind to make David king. '
    39: '³⁹ They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their
      kindred had provided for them. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and
      Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant provisions
      of meal, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep, for
      there was joy in Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ David consulted with the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds,
      with every leader. '
    2: '² David said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and
      if it is the will of the Lord our God, let us send abroad to our kindred who
      remain in all the land of Israel, including the priests and Levites in the cities
      that have pasture lands, that they may come together to us. '
    3: '³ Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we did not turn to
      it in the days of Saul.” '
    4: "⁴ The whole assembly agreed to do so, for the thing pleased all the people.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to
      bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. '
    6: '⁶ And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim,
      which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the Lord, who
      is enthroned on the cherubim, which is called by his name. '
    7: '⁷ They carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and
      Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart. '
    8: "⁸ David and all Israel were dancing before God with all their might, with\
      \ song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand
      to hold the ark, for the oxen shook it. '
    10: '¹⁰ The anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; he struck him down because
      he put out his hand to the ark; and he died there before God. '
    11: '¹¹ David was angry because the Lord had burst out against Uzzah; so that
      place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. '
    12: '¹² David was afraid of God that day; he said, “How can I bring the ark of
      God into my care?” '
    13: '¹³ So David did not take the ark into his care into the city of David; he
      took it instead to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. '
    14: ¹⁴ The ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three
      months, and the Lord blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.
  14:
    1: '¹ King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, and
      masons and carpenters to build a house for him. '
    2: "² David then perceived that the Lord had established him as king over Israel,\
      \ and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became the father of more
      sons and daughters. '
    4: '⁴ These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab,
      and Nathan; Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpelet; '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia; '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
      all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went
      out against them. '
    9: '⁹ Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. '
    10: '¹⁰ David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you
      give them into my hand?” The Lord said to him, “Go up, and I will give them
      into your hand.” '
    11: '¹¹ So he went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. David said,
      “God has burst out against my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood.” Therefore
      that place is called Baal-perazim. '
    12: "¹² They abandoned their gods there, and at David’s command they were burned.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Once again the Philistines made a raid in the valley. '
    14: '¹⁴ When David again inquired of God, God said to him, “You shall not go up
      after them; go around and come on them opposite the balsam trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then
      go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of
      the Philistines.” '
    16: '¹⁶ David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine
      army from Gibeon to Gezer. '
    17: ¹⁷ The fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear
      of him on all nations.
  15:
    1: '¹ David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place
      for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. '
    2: '² Then David commanded that no one but the Levites were to carry the ark of
      God, for the Lord had chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister
      to him forever. '
    3: '³ David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord
      to its place, which he had prepared for it. '
    4: '⁴ Then David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: '
    5: '⁵ of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with one hundred twenty of his kindred; '
    6: '⁶ of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with two hundred twenty of his
      kindred; '
    7: '⁷ of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with one hundred thirty of his kindred; '
    8: '⁸ of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with two hundred of his kindred; '
    9: '⁹ of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with eighty of his kindred; '
    10: "¹⁰ of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with one hundred twelve of\
      \ his kindred. \n"
    11: '¹¹ David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel,
      Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. '
    12: '¹² He said to them, “You are the heads of families of the Levites; sanctify
      yourselves, you and your kindred, so that you may bring up the ark of the Lord,
      the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. '
    13: '¹³ Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God burst out
      against us, because we did not give it proper care.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark
      of the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles,\
      \ as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their kindred
      as the singers to play on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals,
      to raise loud sounds of joy. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; and of his kindred Asaph son
      of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their kindred, Ethan son of Kushaiah; '
    18: '¹⁸ and with them their kindred of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth,
      Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah,
      and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. '
    19: '¹⁹ The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound bronze cymbals; '
    20: '²⁰ Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah
      were to play harps according to Alamoth; '
    21: '²¹ but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were
      to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith. '
    22: '²² Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music, for
      he understood it. '
    23: '²³ Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer,\
      \ the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and\
      \ Jehiah also were to be gatekeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So David and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of the thousands,
      went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom
      with rejoicing. '
    26: '²⁶ And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. '
    27: '²⁷ David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites
      who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the
      music of the singers; and David wore a linen ephod. '
    28: "²⁸ So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting,\
      \ to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps\
      \ and lyres. \n"
    29: ²⁹ As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, Michal
      daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing;
      and she despised him in her heart.
  16:
    1: '¹ They brought in the ark of God, and set it inside the tent that David had
      pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being
      before God. '
    2: '² When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of
      well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord; '
    3: "³ and he distributed to every person in Israel—man and woman alike—to each\
      \ a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. \n"
    4: '⁴ He appointed certain of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the Lord,
      to invoke, to thank, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Asaph was the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
      Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with harps and lyres; Asaph
      was to sound the cymbals, '
    6: "⁶ and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly, before\
      \ the ark of the covenant of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then on that day David first appointed the singing of praises to the Lord\
      \ by Asaph and his kindred. \n"
    8: "⁸ O give thanks to the Lord, call on his name,\n    make known his deeds among\
      \ the peoples.\n"
    9: "⁹ Sing to him, sing praises to him,\n    tell of all his wonderful works.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Glory in his holy name;\n    let the hearts of those who seek the Lord\
      \ rejoice.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Seek the Lord and his strength,\n    seek his presence continually.\n"
    12: "¹² Remember the wonderful works he has done,\n    his miracles, and the judgments\
      \ he uttered,\n"
    13: "¹³ O offspring of his servant Israel,\n    children of Jacob, his chosen\
      \ ones. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God;\n    his judgments are in all the earth.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Remember his covenant forever,\n    the word that he commanded, for a\
      \ thousand generations,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ the covenant that he made with Abraham,\n    his sworn promise to Isaac,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,\n    to Israel as an everlasting\
      \ covenant,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan\n    as your portion for\
      \ an inheritance.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ When they were few in number,\n    of little account, and strangers in\
      \ the land,\n"
    20: "²⁰ wandering from nation to nation,\n    from one kingdom to another people,\n"
    21: "²¹ he allowed no one to oppress them;\n    he rebuked kings on their account,\n"
    22: "²² saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones;\n    do my prophets no harm.”\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Sing to the Lord, all the earth.\n    Tell of his salvation from day to\
      \ day.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Declare his glory among the nations,\n    his marvelous works among all\
      \ the peoples.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;\n    he is to be revered\
      \ above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For all the gods of the peoples are idols,\n    but the Lord made the\
      \ heavens.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Honor and majesty are before him;\n    strength and joy are in his place.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,\n    ascribe to the Lord\
      \ glory and strength.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;\n    bring an offering, and\
      \ come before him.\nWorship the Lord in holy splendor;\n"
    30: "³⁰     tremble before him, all the earth.\n    The world is firmly established;\
      \ it shall never be moved.\n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice,\n    and let them\
      \ say among the nations, “The Lord is king!”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;\n    let the field exult, and\
      \ everything in it.\n"
    33: "³³ Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy\n    before the Lord,\
      \ for he comes to judge the earth.\n"
    34: "³⁴ O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;\n    for his steadfast love\
      \ endures forever. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Say also:\n“Save us, O God of our salvation,\n    and gather and rescue\
      \ us from among the nations,\nthat we may give thanks to your holy name,\n \
      \   and glory in your praise.\n"
    36: "³⁶ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    from everlasting to everlasting.”\n\
      Then all the people said “Amen!” and praised the Lord. \n"
    37: '³⁷ David left Asaph and his kinsfolk there before the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord to minister regularly before the ark as each day required, '
    38: '³⁸ and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight kinsfolk; while Obed-edom son of
      Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers. '
    39: '³⁹ And he left the priest Zadok and his kindred the priests before the tabernacle
      of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, '
    40: '⁴⁰ to offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly,
      morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the Lord
      that he commanded Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and expressly
      named to render thanks to the Lord, for his steadfast love endures forever. '
    42: "⁴² Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music, and\
      \ instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.\
      \ \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people departed to their homes, and David went home to bless
      his household.
  17:
    1: '¹ Now when David settled in his house, David said to the prophet Nathan, “I
      am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under
      a tent.” '
    2: "² Nathan said to David, “Do all that you have in mind, for God is with you.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying: '
    4: '⁴ Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the Lord: You shall not build me
      a house to live in. '
    5: '⁵ For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought out Israel to this
      very day, but I have lived in a tent and a tabernacle. '
    6: '⁶ Wherever I have moved about among all Israel, did I ever speak a word with
      any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying,
      Why have you not built me a house of cedar? '
    7: '⁷ Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the Lord
      of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler
      over my people Israel; '
    8: '⁸ and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies
      before you; and I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones
      of the earth. '
    9: '⁹ I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, so that
      they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall
      wear them down no more, as they did formerly, '
    10: "¹⁰ from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will\
      \ subdue all your enemies.\nMoreover I declare to you that the Lord will build\
      \ you a house. "
    11: '¹¹ When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your ancestors, I will raise
      up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his
      kingdom. '
    12: '¹² He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. I will not take
      my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, '
    14: '¹⁴ but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his
      throne shall be established forever. '
    15: "¹⁵ In accordance with all these words and all this vision, Nathan spoke to\
      \ David. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and said, “Who am I,
      O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? '
    17: '¹⁷ And even this was a small thing in your sight, O God; you have also spoken
      of your servant’s house for a great while to come. You regard me as someone
      of high rank, O Lord God! '
    18: '¹⁸ And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know
      your servant. '
    19: '¹⁹ For your servant’s sake, O Lord, and according to your own heart, you
      have done all these great deeds, making known all these great things. '
    20: '²⁰ There is no one like you, O Lord, and there is no God besides you, according
      to all that we have heard with our ears. '
    21: '²¹ Who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth whom God went
      to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and terrible
      things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt? '
    22: "²² And you made your people Israel to be your people forever; and you, O\
      \ Lord, became their God. \n"
    23: '²³ “And now, O Lord, as for the word that you have spoken concerning your
      servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as you
      have promised. '
    24: '²⁴ Thus your name will be established and magnified forever in the saying,
      ‘The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God’; and the house of your
      servant David will be established in your presence. '
    25: '²⁵ For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house
      for him; therefore your servant has found it possible to pray before you. '
    26: '²⁶ And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to
      your servant; '
    27: ²⁷ therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it
      may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord, have blessed and are blessed
      forever.”
  18:
    1: "¹ Some time afterward, David attacked the Philistines and subdued them; he\
      \ took Gath and its villages from the Philistines. \n"
    2: "² He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became subject to David and brought tribute.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ David also struck down King Hadadezer of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went
      to set up a monument at the river Euphrates. '
    4: '⁴ David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand cavalry, and twenty
      thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left one
      hundred of them. '
    5: '⁵ When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David
      killed twenty-two thousand Arameans. '
    6: '⁶ Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became subject
      to David, and brought tribute. The Lord gave victory to David wherever he went. '
    7: '⁷ David took the gold shields that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer,
      and brought them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a vast quantity\
      \ of bronze; with it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels\
      \ of bronze. \n"
    9: '⁹ When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of
      King Hadadezer of Zobah, '
    10: '¹⁰ he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him and to congratulate
      him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him. Now Hadadezer
      had often been at war with Tou. He sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver,
      and of bronze; '
    11: "¹¹ these also King David dedicated to the Lord, together with the silver\
      \ and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the\
      \ Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley
      of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became subject to David.\
      \ And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and equity
      to all his people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; '
    16: '¹⁶ Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha
      was secretary; '
    17: ¹⁷ Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and
      David’s sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.
  19:
    1: '¹ Some time afterward, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded
      him. '
    2: '² David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun son of Nahash, for his father
      dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his
      father. When David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to
      console him, '
    3: '³ the officials of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David
      has sent consolers to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants
      come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?” '
    4: '⁴ So Hanun seized David’s servants, shaved them, cut off their garments in
      the middle at their hips, and sent them away; '
    5: "⁵ and they departed. When David was told about the men, he sent messengers\
      \ to them, for they felt greatly humiliated. The king said, “Remain at Jericho\
      \ until your beards have grown, and then return.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun
      and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry
      from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and from Zobah. '
    7: '⁷ They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his
      army, who came and camped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from
      their cities and came to battle. '
    8: '⁸ When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the warriors. '
    9: "⁹ The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the\
      \ city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When Joab saw that the line of battle was set against him both in front
      and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel and arrayed them
      against the Arameans; '
    11: '¹¹ the rest of his troops he put in the charge of his brother Abishai, and
      they were arrayed against the Ammonites. '
    12: '¹² He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me;
      but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. '
    13: '¹³ Be strong, and let us be courageous for our people and for the cities
      of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So Joab and the troops who were with him advanced toward the Arameans
      for battle; and they fled before him. '
    15: "¹⁵ When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they likewise fled before\
      \ Abishai, Joab’s brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they
      sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates,
      with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. '
    17: '¹⁷ When David was informed, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the
      Jordan, came to them, and drew up his forces against them. When David set the
      battle in array against the Arameans, they fought with him. '
    18: '¹⁸ The Arameans fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand Aramean
      charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers, and also killed Shophach the commander
      of their army. '
    19: ¹⁹ When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel,
      they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Arameans were
      not willing to help the Ammonites any more.
  20:
    1: '¹ In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led
      out the army, ravaged the country of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah.
      But David remained at Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah, and overthrew it. '
    2: '² David took the crown of Milcom from his head; he found that it weighed a
      talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s
      head. He also brought out the booty of the city, a very great amount. '
    3: "³ He brought out the people who were in it, and set them to work with saws\
      \ and iron picks and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites.\
      \ Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    4: '⁴ After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibbecai the
      Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and
      the Philistines were subdued. '
    5: '⁵ Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan son of Jair killed
      Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like
      a weaver’s beam. '
    6: '⁶ Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great size, who had
      six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number;
      he also was descended from the giants. '
    7: '⁷ When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed
      him. '
    8: ⁸ These were descended from the giants in Gath; they fell by the hand of David
      and his servants.
  21:
    1: '¹ Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to count the people of
      Israel. '
    2: '² So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel,
      from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.” '
    3: '³ But Joab said, “May the Lord increase the number of his people a hundredfold!
      Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord’s servants? Why then should
      my lord require this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” '
    4: '⁴ But the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout
      all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem. '
    5: '⁵ Joab gave the total count of the people to David. In all Israel there were
      one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred
      seventy thousand who drew the sword. '
    6: "⁶ But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king’s\
      \ command was abhorrent to Joab. \n"
    7: '⁷ But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel. '
    8: '⁸ David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing.
      But now, I pray you, take away the guilt of your servant; for I have done very
      foolishly.” '
    9: '⁹ The Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the Lord: Three things I offer you; choose
      one of them, so that I may do it to you.’” '
    11: '¹¹ So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Take your
      choice: '
    12: '¹² either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by your foes,
      while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or three days of the sword of
      the Lord, pestilence on the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout
      all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to the one
      who sent me.” '
    13: "¹³ Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; let me fall into the\
      \ hand of the Lord, for his mercy is very great; but let me not fall into human\
      \ hands.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand persons
      fell in Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about
      to destroy it, the Lord took note and relented concerning the calamity; he said
      to the destroying angel, “Enough! Stay your hand.” The angel of the Lord was
      then standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    16: '¹⁶ David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and
      heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David
      and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. '
    17: "¹⁷ And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the command to count the\
      \ people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what\
      \ have they done? Let your hand, I pray, O Lord my God, be against me and against\
      \ my father’s house; but do not let your people be plagued!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David that he should
      go up and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    19: '¹⁹ So David went up following Gad’s instructions, which he had spoken in
      the name of the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Ornan turned and saw the angel; and while his four sons who were with
      him hid themselves, Ornan continued to thresh wheat. '
    21: '²¹ As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he went out from the
      threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground. '
    22: '²² David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may
      build on it an altar to the Lord—give it to me at its full price—so that the
      plague may be averted from the people.” '
    23: '²³ Then Ornan said to David, “Take it; and let my lord the king do what seems
      good to him; see, I present the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing
      sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I give it all.” '
    24: '²⁴ But King David said to Ornan, “No; I will buy them for the full price.
      I will not take for the Lord what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost
      me nothing.” '
    25: '²⁵ So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site. '
    26: '²⁶ David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burnt offerings and
      offerings of well-being. He called upon the Lord, and he answered him with fire
      from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the Lord commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its\
      \ sheath. \n"
    28: '²⁸ At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing
      floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there. '
    29: '²⁹ For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness,
      and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon; '
    30: ³⁰ but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of
      the sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the Lord God and here the altar\
      \ of burnt offering for Israel.” \n"
    2: '² David gave orders to gather together the aliens who were residing in the
      land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building
      the house of God. '
    3: '³ David also provided great stores of iron for nails for the doors of the
      gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing, '
    4: '⁴ and cedar logs without number—for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great
      quantities of cedar to David. '
    5: "⁵ For David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house\
      \ that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and\
      \ glorified throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparation for it.”\
      \ So David provided materials in great quantity before his death. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for
      the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ David said to Solomon, “My son, I had planned to build a house to the name
      of the Lord my God. '
    8: '⁸ But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and
      have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to my name, because you have
      shed so much blood in my sight on the earth. '
    9: '⁹ See, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give
      him peace from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon,
      and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall build a house for my name. He shall be a son to me, and I will
      be a father to him, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.’ '
    11: '¹¹ Now, my son, the Lord be with you, so that you may succeed in building
      the house of the Lord your God, as he has spoken concerning you. '
    12: '¹² Only, may the Lord grant you discretion and understanding, so that when
      he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the Lord your God. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the
      ordinances that the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and of good courage.
      Do not be afraid or dismayed. '
    14: '¹⁴ With great pains I have provided for the house of the Lord one hundred
      thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron
      beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone too I have provided.
      To these you must add more. '
    15: '¹⁵ You have an abundance of workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and
      all kinds of artisans without number, skilled in working '
    16: "¹⁶ gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and the Lord be with\
      \ you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon,
      saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Is not the Lord your God with you? Has he not given you peace on every
      side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the
      land is subdued before the Lord and his people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now set your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Go and build the
      sanctuary of the Lord God so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the
      holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the Lord.”
  23:
    1: "¹ When David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites. '
    3: '³ The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were counted, and the total was
      thirty-eight thousand. '
    4: '⁴ “Twenty-four thousand of these,” David said, “shall have charge of the work
      in the house of the Lord, six thousand shall be officers and judges, '
    5: '⁵ four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand shall offer praises to the
      Lord with the instruments that I have made for praise.” '
    6: "⁶ And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi:\
      \ Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: '⁷ The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei. '
    8: '⁸ The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the
      heads of families of Ladan. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were
      the sons of Shimei. '
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not\
      \ have many sons, so they were enrolled as a single family. \n"
    12: '¹² The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate
      the most holy things, so that he and his sons forever should make offerings
      before the Lord, and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever; '
    14: '¹⁴ but as for Moses the man of God, his sons were to be reckoned among the
      tribe of Levi. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. '
    16: '¹⁶ The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. '
    17: '¹⁷ The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief; Eliezer had no other sons, but
      the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous. '
    18: '¹⁸ The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. '
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the
      third, and Jekameam the fourth. '
    20: "²⁰ The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second. \n"
    21: '²¹ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. '
    22: '²² Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kindred, the sons
      of Kish, married them. '
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. \n"
    24: '²⁴ These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses, the heads of families
      as they were enrolled according to the number of the names of the individuals
      from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of
      the house of the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ For David said, “The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people;
      and he resides in Jerusalem forever. '
    26: '²⁶ And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the
      things for its service”— '
    27: '²⁷ for according to the last words of David these were the number of the
      Levites from twenty years old and upward— '
    28: '²⁸ “but their duty shall be to assist the descendants of Aaron for the service
      of the house of the Lord, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the
      cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of
      God; '
    29: '²⁹ to assist also with the rows of bread, the choice flour for the grain
      offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed
      with oil, and all measures of quantity or size. '
    30: '³⁰ And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the Lord, and
      likewise at evening, '
    31: '³¹ and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the Lord on sabbaths, new
      moons, and appointed festivals, according to the number required of them, regularly
      before the Lord. '
    32: ³² Thus they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and
      shall attend the descendants of Aaron, their kindred, for the service of the
      house of the Lord.”
  24:
    1: '¹ The divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron:
      Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    2: '² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons; so Eleazar
      and Ithamar became the priests. '
    3: '³ Along with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,
      David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service. '
    4: '⁴ Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the
      sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of ancestral houses
      of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar. '
    5: '⁵ They organized them by lot, all alike, for there were officers of the sanctuary
      and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar. '
    6: "⁶ The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence\
      \ of the king, and the officers, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech son of\
      \ Abiathar, and the heads of ancestral houses of the priests and of the Levites;\
      \ one ancestral house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen for Ithamar. \n"
    7: '⁷ The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, '
    8: '⁸ the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, '
    9: '⁹ the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, '
    10: '¹⁰ the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, '
    11: '¹¹ the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, '
    12: '¹² the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, '
    13: '¹³ the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, '
    14: '¹⁴ the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, '
    15: '¹⁵ the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, '
    16: '¹⁶ the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, '
    17: '¹⁷ the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, '
    18: '¹⁸ the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. '
    19: "¹⁹ These had as their appointed duty in their service to enter the house\
      \ of the Lord according to the procedure established for them by their ancestor\
      \ Aaron, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of
      the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. '
    21: '²¹ Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. '
    22: '²² Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the
      third, Jekameam the fourth. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. '
    25: '²⁵ The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. '
    26: '²⁶ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno. '
    27: '²⁷ The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. '
    28: '²⁸ Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. '
    29: '²⁹ Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel. '
    30: '³⁰ The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the
      Levites according to their ancestral houses. '
    31: ³¹ These also cast lots corresponding to their kindred, the descendants of
      Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of ancestral
      houses of the priests and of the Levites, the chief as well as the youngest
      brother.
  25:
    1: '¹ David and the officers of the army also set apart for the service the sons
      of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with lyres, harps,
      and cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was: '
    2: '² Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph,

    3: '³ Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah,

      Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi,
      Hothir, Mahazioth. '
    5: '⁵ All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer, according to the promise
      of God to exalt him; for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. '
    6: '⁶ They were all under the direction of their father for the music in the house
      of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the house of God.
      Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the order of the king. '
    7: '⁷ They and their kindred, who were trained in singing to the Lord, all of
      whom were skillful, numbered two hundred eighty-eight. '

      son of Uzziah. '
    26: '²⁶ Over those who did the work of the field, tilling the soil, was Ezri son
      of Chelub. '
    27: '²⁷ Over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite. Over the produce of the vineyards
      for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite. '
    28: '²⁸ Over the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah was Baal-hanan the
      Gederite. Over the stores of oil was Joash. '
    29: '²⁹ Over the herds that pastured in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite. Over
      the herds in the valleys was Shaphat son of Adlai. '
    30: '³⁰ Over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite. Over the donkeys was Jehdeiah
      the Meronothite. Over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. '
    31: "³¹ All these were stewards of King David’s property. \n"
    32: '³² Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, being a man of understanding
      and a scribe; Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended the king’s sons. '
    33: '³³ Ahithophel was the king’s counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s
      friend. '
    34: ³⁴ After Ahithophel came Jehoiada son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was commander
      of the king’s army.
  28:
    1: '¹ David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials
      of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders
      of the thousands, the commanders of the hundreds, the stewards of all the property
      and cattle of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the
      mighty warriors, and all the warriors. '
    2: '² Then King David rose to his feet and said: “Hear me, my brothers and my
      people. I had planned to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord, for the footstool of our God; and I made preparations for building. '
    3: '³ But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, for you are
      a warrior and have shed blood.’ '
    4: '⁴ Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me from all my ancestral house to be king
      over Israel forever; for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah
      my father’s house, and among my father’s sons he took delight in making me king
      over all Israel. '
    5: '⁵ And of all my sons, for the Lord has given me many, he has chosen my son
      Solomon to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. '
    6: '⁶ He said to me, ‘It is your son Solomon who shall build my house and my courts,
      for I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. '
    7: '⁷ I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues resolute in keeping
      my commandments and my ordinances, as he is today.’ '
    8: "⁸ Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and\
      \ in the hearing of our God, observe and search out all the commandments of\
      \ the Lord your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an\
      \ inheritance to your children after you forever. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him with
      single mind and willing heart; for the Lord searches every mind, and understands
      every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you
      forsake him, he will abandon you forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ Take heed now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary;\
      \ be strong, and act.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David gave his son Solomon the plan of the vestibule of the temple,
      and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers,
      and of the room for the mercy seat; '
    12: '¹² and the plan of all that he had in mind: for the courts of the house of
      the Lord, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God,
      and the treasuries for dedicated gifts; '
    13: '¹³ for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work
      of the service in the house of the Lord; for all the vessels for the service
      in the house of the Lord, '
    14: '¹⁴ the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight
      of silver vessels for each service, '
    15: '¹⁵ the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold
      for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its
      lamps, according to the use of each in the service, '
    16: '¹⁶ the weight of gold for each table for the rows of bread, the silver for
      the silver tables, '
    17: '¹⁷ and pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups; for the golden
      bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each; '
    18: "¹⁸ for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his\
      \ plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered\
      \ the ark of the covenant of the Lord. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “All this, in writing at the Lord’s direction, he made clear to me—the\
      \ plan of all the works.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ David said further to his son Solomon, “Be strong and of good courage,
      and act. Do not be afraid or dismayed; for the Lord God, my God, is with you.
      He will not fail you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the
      house of the Lord is finished. '
    21: ²¹ Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service
      of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every volunteer who
      has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will
      be wholly at your command.”
  29:
    1: '¹ King David said to the whole assembly, “My son Solomon, whom alone God has
      chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great; for the temple will
      not be for mortals but for the Lord God. '
    2: '² So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold
      for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze
      for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the
      things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony,
      colored stones, all sorts of precious stones, and marble in abundance. '
    3: '³ Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I
      have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to
      the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: '
    4: '⁴ three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand
      talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, '
    5: "⁵ and for all the work to be done by artisans, gold for the things of gold\
      \ and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating\
      \ themselves today to the Lord?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the leaders of ancestral houses made their freewill offerings, as did
      also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds,
      and the officers over the king’s work. '
    7: '⁷ They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and
      ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand
      talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. '
    8: '⁸ Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the
      Lord, into the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. '
    9: "⁹ Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with single\
      \ mind they had offered freely to the Lord; King David also rejoiced greatly.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly; David
      said: “Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our ancestor Israel, forever and
      ever. '
    11: '¹¹ Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and
      the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours; yours
      is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all. '
    12: '¹² Riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are
      power and might; and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to
      all. '
    13: "¹³ And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your glorious name.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to make this
      freewill offering? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given
      you. '
    15: '¹⁵ For we are aliens and transients before you, as were all our ancestors;
      our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope. '
    16: '¹⁶ O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building
      you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. '
    17: '¹⁷ I know, my God, that you search the heart, and take pleasure in uprightness;
      in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now
      I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously
      to you. '
    18: '¹⁸ O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep forever
      such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts
      toward you. '
    19: "¹⁹ Grant to my son Solomon that with single mind he may keep your commandments,\
      \ your decrees, and your statutes, performing all of them, and that he may build\
      \ the temple for which I have made provision.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then David said to the whole assembly, “Bless the Lord your God.” And
      all the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and bowed their
      heads and prostrated themselves before the Lord and the king. '
    21: '²¹ On the next day they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord,
      a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their libations,
      and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; '
    22: "²² and they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy.\nThey\
      \ made David’s son Solomon king a second time; they anointed him as the Lord’s\
      \ prince, and Zadok as priest. "
    23: '²³ Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord, succeeding his father David
      as king; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: '²⁴ All the leaders and the mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King
      David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. '
    25: "²⁵ The Lord highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed\
      \ upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ Thus David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. '
    27: '²⁷ The period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven
      years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. '
    28: '²⁸ He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and his son
      Solomon succeeded him. '
    29: '²⁹ Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the records
      of the seer Samuel, and in the records of the prophet Nathan, and in the records
      of the seer Gad, '
    30: ³⁰ with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the events that befell
      him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the earth.
