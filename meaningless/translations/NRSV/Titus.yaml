Titus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the
      faith of God’s elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with
      godliness, '
    2: '² in the hope of eternal life that God, who never lies, promised before the
      ages began— '
    3: "³ in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which I have\
      \ been entrusted by the command of God our Savior, \n"
    4: "⁴ To Titus, my loyal child in the faith we share:\nGrace and peace from God\
      \ the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. \n"
    5: '⁵ I left you behind in Crete for this reason, so that you should put in order
      what remained to be done, and should appoint elders in every town, as I directed
      you: '
    6: '⁶ someone who is blameless, married only once, whose children are believers,
      not accused of debauchery and not rebellious. '
    7: '⁷ For a bishop, as God’s steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant
      or quick-tempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain; '
    8: '⁸ but he must be hospitable, a lover of goodness, prudent, upright, devout,
      and self-controlled. '
    9: "⁹ He must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance\
      \ with the teaching, so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine\
      \ and to refute those who contradict it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ There are also many rebellious people, idle talkers and deceivers, especially
      those of the circumcision; '
    11: '¹¹ they must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching
      for sordid gain what it is not right to teach. '
    12: "¹² It was one of them, their very own prophet, who said,\n“Cretans are always\
      \ liars, vicious brutes, lazy gluttons.” \n"
    13: '¹³ That testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply, so that they
      may become sound in the faith, '
    14: '¹⁴ not paying attention to Jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject
      the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing
      is pure. Their very minds and consciences are corrupted. '
    16: ¹⁶ They profess to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are
      detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
  2:
    1: '¹ But as for you, teach what is consistent with sound doctrine. '
    2: "² Tell the older men to be temperate, serious, prudent, and sound in faith,\
      \ in love, and in endurance. \n"
    3: '³ Likewise, tell the older women to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers
      or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good, '
    4: '⁴ so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love
      their children, '
    5: "⁵ to be self-controlled, chaste, good managers of the household, kind, being\
      \ submissive to their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. '
    7: '⁷ Show yourself in all respects a model of good works, and in your teaching
      show integrity, gravity, '
    8: "⁸ and sound speech that cannot be censured; then any opponent will be put\
      \ to shame, having nothing evil to say of us. \n"
    9: '⁹ Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in
      every respect; they are not to talk back, '
    10: "¹⁰ not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything\
      \ they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, '
    12: '¹² training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present
      age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, '
    13: '¹³ while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory
      of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. '
    14: "¹⁴ He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity\
      \ and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.\
      \ \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one
      look down on you.
  3:
    1: '¹ Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to
      be ready for every good work, '
    2: '² to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show
      every courtesy to everyone. '
    3: '³ For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various
      passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, despicable, hating
      one another. '
    4: '⁴ But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, '
    5: '⁵ he saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done,
      but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the
      Holy Spirit. '
    6: '⁶ This Spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, '
    7: '⁷ so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs according
      to the hope of eternal life. '
    8: "⁸ The saying is sure.\nI desire that you insist on these things, so that those\
      \ who have come to believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to good\
      \ works; these things are excellent and profitable to everyone. "
    9: '⁹ But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about
      the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. '
    10: '¹⁰ After a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone
      who causes divisions, '
    11: "¹¹ since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do your best to come to me at
      Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. '
    13: '¹³ Make every effort to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, and
      see that they lack nothing. '
    14: "¹⁴ And let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet\
      \ urgent needs, so that they may not be unproductive. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in\
      \ the faith.\nGrace be with all of you."
