2 Chronicles:
  1:
    1: "¹ Solomon son of David established himself in his kingdom; the Lord his God\
      \ was with him and made him exceedingly great. \n"
    2: '² Solomon summoned all Israel, the commanders of the thousands and of the
      hundreds, the judges, and all the leaders of all Israel, the heads of families. '
    3: '³ Then Solomon, and the whole assembly with him, went to the high place that
      was at Gibeon; for God’s tent of meeting, which Moses the servant of the Lord
      had made in the wilderness, was there. '
    4: '⁴ (But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath-jearim to the place
      that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) '
    5: '⁵ Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, had made,
      was there in front of the tabernacle of the Lord. And Solomon and the assembly
      inquired at it. '
    6: "⁶ Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the Lord, which was at\
      \ the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. \n"
    7: '⁷ That night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I should
      give you.” '
    8: '⁸ Solomon said to God, “You have shown great and steadfast love to my father
      David, and have made me succeed him as king. '
    9: '⁹ O Lord God, let your promise to my father David now be fulfilled, for you
      have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. '
    10: '¹⁰ Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people,
      for who can rule this great people of yours?” '
    11: '¹¹ God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not
      asked for possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and
      have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for
      yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king, '
    12: '¹² wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches,
      possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and
      none after you shall have the like.” '
    13: "¹³ So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting,\
      \ to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Solomon gathered together chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred
      chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities
      and with the king in Jerusalem. '
    15: '¹⁵ The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he
      made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. '
    16: '¹⁶ Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the king’s traders
      received them from Kue at the prevailing price. '
    17: ¹⁷ They imported from Egypt, and then exported, a chariot for six hundred
      shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; so through them these
      were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
  2:
    1: '¹ Solomon decided to build a temple for the name of the Lord, and a royal
      palace for himself. '
    2: "² Solomon conscripted seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters\
      \ in the hill country, with three thousand six hundred to oversee them. \n"
    3: '³ Solomon sent word to King Huram of Tyre: “Once you dealt with my father
      David and sent him cedar to build himself a house to live in. '
    4: '⁴ I am now about to build a house for the name of the Lord my God and dedicate
      it to him for offering fragrant incense before him, and for the regular offering
      of the rows of bread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths
      and the new moons and the appointed festivals of the Lord our God, as ordained
      forever for Israel. '
    5: '⁵ The house that I am about to build will be great, for our God is greater
      than other gods. '
    6: '⁶ But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven,
      cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to
      make offerings before him? '
    7: '⁷ So now send me an artisan skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron,
      and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to join
      the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David
      provided. '
    8: '⁸ Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that
      your servants are skilled in cutting Lebanon timber. My servants will work with
      your servants '
    9: '⁹ to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am about to build
      will be great and wonderful. '
    10: "¹⁰ I will provide for your servants, those who cut the timber, twenty thousand\
      \ cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths\
      \ of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then King Huram of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon,
      “Because the Lord loves his people he has made you king over them.” '
    12: "¹² Huram also said, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and\
      \ earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding,\
      \ who will build a temple for the Lord, and a royal palace for himself. \n"
    13: '¹³ “I have dispatched Huram-abi, a skilled artisan, endowed with understanding, '
    14: '¹⁴ the son of one of the Danite women, his father a Tyrian. He is trained
      to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue,
      and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute
      any design that may be assigned him, with your artisans, the artisans of my
      lord, your father David. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now, as for the wheat, barley, oil, and wine, of which my lord has spoken,
      let him send them to his servants. '
    16: "¹⁶ We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you\
      \ as rafts by sea to Joppa; you will take it up to Jerusalem.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were residing in the
      land of Israel, after the census that his father David had taken; and there
      were found to be one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred. '
    18: ¹⁸ Seventy thousand of them he assigned as laborers, eighty thousand as stonecutters
      in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to make the
      people work.
  3:
    1: '¹ Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah,
      where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had
      designated, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    2: '² He began to build on the second day of the second month of the fourth year
      of his reign. '
    3: '³ These are Solomon’s measurements for building the house of God: the length,
      in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits. '
    4: '⁴ The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long,
      across the width of the house; and its height was one hundred twenty cubits.
      He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold. '
    5: '⁵ The nave he lined with cypress, covered it with fine gold, and made palms
      and chains on it. '
    6: '⁶ He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold
      from Parvaim. '
    7: "⁷ So he lined the house with gold—its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and\
      \ its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls. \n"
    8: '⁸ He made the most holy place; its length, corresponding to the width of the
      house, was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; he overlaid it with
      six hundred talents of fine gold. '
    9: "⁹ The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper\
      \ chambers with gold. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ In the most holy place he made two carved cherubim and overlaid them with
      gold. '
    11: '¹¹ The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of
      the one, five cubits long, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing,
      five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub; '
    12: '¹² and of this cherub, one wing, five cubits long, touched the wall of the
      house, and the other wing, also five cubits long, was joined to the wing of
      the first cherub. '
    13: '¹³ The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits; the cherubim stood
      on their feet, facing the nave. '
    14: "¹⁴ And Solomon made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and\
      \ fine linen, and worked cherubim into it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with
      a capital of five cubits on the top of each. '
    16: '¹⁶ He made encircling chains and put them on the tops of the pillars; and
      he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. '
    17: ¹⁷ He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right, the other
      on the left; the one on the right he called Jachin, and the one on the left,
      Boaz.
  4:
    1: '¹ He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and
      ten cubits high. '
    2: '² Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from rim to rim, and
      five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely. '
    3: '³ Under it were panels all around, each of ten cubits, surrounding the sea;
      there were two rows of panels, cast when it was cast. '
    4: '⁴ It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing
      south, and three facing east; the sea was set on them. The hindquarters of each
      were toward the inside. '
    5: '⁵ Its thickness was a handbreadth; its rim was made like the rim of a cup,
      like the flower of a lily; it held three thousand baths. '
    6: "⁶ He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the right side,\
      \ and five on the left. In these they were to rinse what was used for the burnt\
      \ offering. The sea was for the priests to wash in. \n"
    7: '⁷ He made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple,
      five on the south side and five on the north. '
    8: '⁸ He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right
      side and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold. '
    9: '⁹ He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the
      court; he overlaid their doors with bronze. '
    10: "¹⁰ He set the sea at the southeast corner of the house. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. Thus Huram finished
      the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God: '
    12: '¹² the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars;
      and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on
      the top of the pillars; '
    13: '¹³ the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates
      for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
      pillars. '
    14: '¹⁴ He made the stands, the basins on the stands, '
    15: '¹⁵ the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it. '
    16: '¹⁶ The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi
      made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between
      Succoth and Zeredah. '
    18: "¹⁸ Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight\
      \ of the bronze was not determined. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden
      altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, '
    20: '²⁰ the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary,
      as prescribed; '
    21: '²¹ the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold; '
    22: '²² the snuffers, basins, ladles, and firepans, of pure gold. As for the entrance
      to the temple: the inner doors to the most holy place and the doors of the nave
      of the temple were of gold.'
  5:
    1: "¹ Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the Lord was finished.\
      \ Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, and stored\
      \ the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of\
      \ God. \n"
    2: '² Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes,
      the leaders of the ancestral houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to
      bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which
      is Zion. '
    3: '³ And all the Israelites assembled before the king at the festival that is
      in the seventh month. '
    4: '⁴ And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites carried the ark. '
    5: '⁵ So they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels
      that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up. '
    6: '⁶ King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before
      him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could
      not be numbered or counted. '
    7: '⁷ Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place,
      in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the
      wings of the cherubim. '
    8: '⁸ For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that
      the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles. '
    9: '⁹ The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy
      place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside;
      they are there to this day. '
    10: "¹⁰ There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses put there\
      \ at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel after they\
      \ came out of Egypt. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when the priests came out of the holy place (for all the priests who
      were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to their divisions), '
    12: '¹² all the levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and
      kindred, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of
      the altar with one hundred twenty priests who were trumpeters. '
    13: "¹³ It was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard\
      \ in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, and when the song was raised,\
      \ with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the\
      \ Lord,\n“For he is good,\n    for his steadfast love endures forever,”\nthe\
      \ house, the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud, "
    14: ¹⁴ so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for
      the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.
  6:
    1: '¹ Then Solomon said, “The Lord has said that he would reside in thick darkness. '
    2: "² I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to reside in forever.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while
      all the assembly of Israel stood. '
    4: '⁴ And he said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hand
      has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying, '
    5: '⁵ ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have
      not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house,
      so that my name might be there, and I chose no one as ruler over my people Israel; '
    6: '⁶ but I have chosen Jerusalem in order that my name may be there, and I have
      chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ '
    7: '⁷ My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the Lord,
      the God of Israel. '
    8: '⁸ But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to consider building
      a house for my name; '
    9: '⁹ nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born
      to you shall build the house for my name.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ Now the Lord has fulfilled his promise that he made; for I have succeeded
      my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and
      have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he\
      \ made with the people of Israel.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the
      whole assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands. '
    13: '¹³ Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide,
      and three cubits high, and had set it in the court; and he stood on it. Then
      he knelt on his knees in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, and spread
      out his hands toward heaven. '
    14: '¹⁴ He said, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven or
      on earth, keeping covenant in steadfast love with your servants who walk before
      you with all their heart— '
    15: '¹⁵ you who have kept for your servant, my father David, what you promised
      to him. Indeed, you promised with your mouth and this day have fulfilled with
      your hand. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant, my father David,
      that which you promised him, saying, ‘There shall never fail you a successor
      before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children keep to their
      way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you\
      \ promised to your servant David. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “But will God indeed reside with mortals on earth? Even heaven and the
      highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built! '
    19: '¹⁹ Regard your servant’s prayer and his plea, O Lord my God, heeding the
      cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you. '
    20: '²⁰ May your eyes be open day and night toward this house, the place where
      you promised to set your name, and may you heed the prayer that your servant
      prays toward this place. '
    21: "²¹ And hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they\
      \ pray toward this place; may you hear from heaven your dwelling place; hear\
      \ and forgive. \n"
    22: '²² “If someone sins against another and is required to take an oath and comes
      and swears before your altar in this house, '
    23: "²³ may you hear from heaven, and act, and judge your servants, repaying the\
      \ guilty by bringing their conduct on their own head, and vindicating those\
      \ who are in the right by rewarding them in accordance with their righteousness.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ “When your people Israel, having sinned against you, are defeated before
      an enemy but turn again to you, confess your name, pray and plead with you in
      this house, '
    25: "²⁵ may you hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and\
      \ bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their ancestors.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned
      against you, and then they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn
      from their sin, because you punish them, '
    27: "²⁷ may you hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your servants, your people\
      \ Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send\
      \ down rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “If there is famine in the land, if there is plague, blight, mildew, locust,
      or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in any of the settlements of the
      lands; whatever suffering, whatever sickness there is; '
    29: '²⁹ whatever prayer, whatever plea from any individual or from all your people
      Israel, all knowing their own suffering and their own sorrows so that they stretch
      out their hands toward this house; '
    30: '³⁰ may you hear from heaven, your dwelling place, forgive, and render to
      all whose heart you know, according to all their ways, for only you know the
      human heart. '
    31: "³¹ Thus may they fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live\
      \ in the land that you gave to our ancestors. \n"
    32: '³² “Likewise when foreigners, who are not of your people Israel, come from
      a distant land because of your great name, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched
      arm, when they come and pray toward this house, '
    33: "³³ may you hear from heaven your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigners\
      \ ask of you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name\
      \ and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that your name\
      \ has been invoked on this house that I have built. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way
      you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen
      and the house that I have built for your name, '
    35: "³⁵ then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their\
      \ cause. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you
      are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away
      captive to a land far or near; '
    37: '³⁷ then if they come to their senses in the land to which they have been
      taken captive, and repent, and plead with you in the land of their captivity,
      saying, ‘We have sinned, and have done wrong; we have acted wickedly’; '
    38: '³⁸ if they repent with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity,
      to which they were taken captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave
      to their ancestors, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have
      built for your name, '
    39: '³⁹ then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas,
      maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to prayer\
      \ from this place. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Now rise up, O Lord God, and go to your resting place,\n    you and the\
      \ ark of your might.\nLet your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation,\n\
      \    and let your faithful rejoice in your goodness.\n"
    42: "⁴² O Lord God, do not reject your anointed one.\n    Remember your steadfast\
      \ love for your servant David.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ When Solomon had ended his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed
      the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the
      temple. '
    2: '² The priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory of
      the Lord filled the Lord’s house. '
    3: "³ When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the\
      \ Lord on the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the\
      \ ground, and worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord, saying,\n“For he is good,\n\
      \    for his steadfast love endures forever.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred
      twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of
      God. '
    6: "⁶ The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments\
      \ for music to the Lord that King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord—for\
      \ his steadfast love endures forever—whenever David offered praises by their\
      \ ministry. Opposite them the priests sounded trumpets; and all Israel stood.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house\
      \ of the Lord; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the offerings\
      \ of well-being because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the\
      \ burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat parts. \n"
    8: '⁸ At that time Solomon held the festival for seven days, and all Israel with
      him, a very great congregation, from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they had observed the
      dedication of the altar seven days and the festival seven days. '
    10: "¹⁰ On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to\
      \ their homes, joyful and in good spirits because of the goodness that the Lord\
      \ had shown to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king’s house; all\
      \ that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house\
      \ he successfully accomplished. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Lord appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: “I have
      heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. '
    13: '¹³ When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust
      to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people, '
    14: '¹⁴ if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my
      face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will
      forgive their sin and heal their land. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made
      in this place. '
    16: '¹⁶ For now I have chosen and consecrated this house so that my name may be
      there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time. '
    17: '¹⁷ As for you, if you walk before me, as your father David walked, doing
      according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, '
    18: "¹⁸ then I will establish your royal throne, as I made covenant with your\
      \ father David saying, ‘You shall never lack a successor to rule over Israel.’\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that
      I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, '
    20: '²⁰ then I will pluck you up from the land that I have given you; and this
      house, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and
      will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. '
    21: '²¹ And regarding this house, now exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished,
      and say, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this house?’ '
    22: ²² Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the Lord the God of their ancestors
      who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods, and
      worshiped them and served them; therefore he has brought all this calamity upon
      them.’”
  8:
    1: '¹ At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon had built the house of
      the Lord and his own house, '
    2: "² Solomon rebuilt the cities that Huram had given to him, and settled the\
      \ people of Israel in them. \n"
    3: '³ Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and captured it. '
    4: '⁴ He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage towns that he built
      in Hamath. '
    5: '⁵ He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities, with
      walls, gates, and bars, '
    6: '⁶ and Baalath, as well as all Solomon’s storage towns, and all the towns for
      his chariots, the towns for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build,
      in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. '
    7: '⁷ All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,
      the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, '
    8: '⁸ from their descendants who were still left in the land, whom the people
      of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon conscripted for forced labor, as is
      still the case today. '
    9: '⁹ But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were
      soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariotry and cavalry. '
    10: "¹⁰ These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred fifty of them,\
      \ who exercised authority over the people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter from the city of David to the house\
      \ that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house\
      \ of King David of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the Lord has come\
      \ are holy.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the
      Lord that he had built in front of the vestibule, '
    13: '¹³ as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment
      of Moses for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual festivals—the
      festival of unleavened bread, the festival of weeks, and the festival of booths. '
    14: '¹⁴ According to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions
      of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise
      and ministry alongside the priests as the duty of each day required, and the
      gatekeepers in their divisions for the several gates; for so David the man of
      God had commanded. '
    15: "¹⁵ They did not turn away from what the king had commanded the priests and\
      \ Levites regarding anything at all, or regarding the treasuries. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus all the work of Solomon was accomplished from the day the foundation\
      \ of the house of the Lord was laid until the house of the Lord was finished\
      \ completely. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in
      the land of Edom. '
    18: ¹⁸ Huram sent him, in the care of his servants, ships and servants familiar
      with the sea. They went to Ophir, together with the servants of Solomon, and
      imported from there four hundred fifty talents of gold and brought it to King
      Solomon.
  9:
    1: '¹ When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem
      to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing
      spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she
      discussed with him all that was on her mind. '
    2: '² Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon
      that he could not explain to her. '
    3: '³ When the queen of Sheba had observed the wisdom of Solomon, the house that
      he had built, '
    4: "⁴ the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance\
      \ of his servants, and their clothing, his valets, and their clothing, and his\
      \ burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the Lord, there was no more\
      \ spirit left in her. \n"
    5: '⁵ So she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land
      of your accomplishments and of your wisdom, '
    6: '⁶ but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes saw it. Not
      even half of the greatness of your wisdom had been told to me; you far surpass
      the report that I had heard. '
    7: '⁷ Happy are your people! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend
      you and hear your wisdom! '
    8: '⁸ Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his
      throne as king for the Lord your God. Because your God loved Israel and would
      establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute
      justice and righteousness.” '
    9: "⁹ Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, a very great\
      \ quantity of spices, and precious stones: there were no spices such as those\
      \ that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought
      gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones. '
    11: "¹¹ From the algum wood, the king made steps for the house of the Lord and\
      \ for the king’s house, lyres also and harps for the singers; there never was\
      \ seen the like of them before in the land of Judah. \n"
    12: "¹² Meanwhile King Solomon granted the queen of Sheba every desire that she\
      \ expressed, well beyond what she had brought to the king. Then she returned\
      \ to her own land, with her servants. \n"
    13: '¹³ The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six
      talents of gold, '
    14: '¹⁴ besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings
      of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. '
    15: '¹⁵ King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred
      shekels of beaten gold went into each large shield. '
    16: '¹⁶ He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of
      gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest
      of Lebanon. '
    17: '¹⁷ The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold. '
    18: '¹⁸ The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached
      to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing
      beside the arm rests, '
    19: '¹⁹ while twelve lions were standing, one on each end of a step on the six
      steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. '
    20: '²⁰ All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
      of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered
      as anything in the days of Solomon. '
    21: "²¹ For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once\
      \ every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver,\
      \ ivory, apes, and peacocks. \n"
    22: '²² Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in
      wisdom. '
    23: '²³ All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his
      wisdom, which God had put into his mind. '
    24: '²⁴ Every one of them brought a present, objects of silver and gold, garments,
      weaponry, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. '
    25: '²⁵ Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand
      horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. '
    26: '²⁶ He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines,
      and to the border of Egypt. '
    27: '²⁷ The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar as plentiful
      as the sycamore of the Shephelah. '
    28: "²⁸ Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not
      written in the history of the prophet Nathan, and in the prophecy of Ahijah
      the Shilonite, and in the visions of the seer Iddo concerning Jeroboam son of
      Nebat? '
    30: '³⁰ Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. '
    31: ³¹ Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father
      David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.
  10:
    1: '¹ Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him
      king. '
    2: '² When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had
      fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. '
    3: '³ They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam, '
    4: '⁴ “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service
      of your father and his heavy yoke that he placed on us, and we will serve you.” '
    5: "⁵ He said to them, “Come to me again in three days.” So the people went away.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the older men who had attended his
      father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer
      this people?” '
    7: '⁷ They answered him, “If you will be kind to this people and please them,
      and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” '
    8: '⁸ But he rejected the advice that the older men gave him, and consulted the
      young men who had grown up with him and now attended him. '
    9: '⁹ He said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have
      said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?” '
    10: '¹⁰ The young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus should you
      speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you
      must lighten it for us’; tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s
      loins. '
    11: "¹¹ Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.\
      \ My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
      king had said, “Come to me again the third day.” '
    13: '¹³ The king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the
      older men; '
    14: '¹⁴ he spoke to them in accordance with the advice of the young men, “My father
      made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips,
      but I will discipline you with scorpions.” '
    15: "¹⁵ So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of affairs\
      \ brought about by God so that the Lord might fulfill his word, which he had\
      \ spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people\
      \ answered the king,\n“What share do we have in David?\n    We have no inheritance\
      \ in the son of Jesse.\nEach of you to your tents, O Israel!\n    Look now to\
      \ your own house, O David.”\nSo all Israel departed to their tents. "
    17: '¹⁷ But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who were living in the
      cities of Judah. '
    18: '¹⁸ When King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor,
      the people of Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurriedly mounted his
      chariot to flee to Jerusalem. '
    19: ¹⁹ So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
  11:
    1: '¹ When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled one hundred eighty thousand
      chosen troops of the house of Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel, to
      restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. '
    2: '² But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God: '
    3: '³ Say to King Rehoboam of Judah, son of Solomon, and to all Israel in Judah
      and Benjamin, '
    4: "⁴ “Thus says the Lord: You shall not go up or fight against your kindred.\
      \ Let everyone return home, for this thing is from me.” So they heeded the word\
      \ of the Lord and turned back from the expedition against Jeroboam. \n"
    5: '⁵ Rehoboam resided in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah. '
    6: '⁶ He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, '
    7: '⁷ Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, '
    8: '⁸ Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, '
    9: '⁹ Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, '
    10: '¹⁰ Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in
      Benjamin. '
    11: '¹¹ He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores
      of food, oil, and wine. '
    12: "¹² He also put large shields and spears in all the cities, and made them\
      \ very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin. \n"
    13: '¹³ The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves
      to him from all their territories. '
    14: '¹⁴ The Levites had left their common lands and their holdings and had come
      to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had prevented them from
      serving as priests of the Lord, '
    15: '¹⁵ and had appointed his own priests for the high places, and for the goat-demons,
      and for the calves that he had made. '
    16: '¹⁶ Those who had set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came after
      them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord, the
      God of their ancestors. '
    17: "¹⁷ They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made\
      \ Rehoboam son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way\
      \ of David and Solomon. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath daughter of Jerimoth son of David,
      and of Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse. '
    19: '¹⁹ She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. '
    20: '²⁰ After her he took Maacah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai,
      Ziza, and Shelomith. '
    21: '²¹ Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his other wives
      and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the
      father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters). '
    22: '²² Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers,
      for he intended to make him king. '
    23: ²³ He dealt wisely, and distributed some of his sons through all the districts
      of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities; he gave them abundant provisions,
      and found many wives for them.
  12:
    1: '¹ When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he grew strong, he abandoned
      the law of the Lord, he and all Israel with him. '
    2: '² In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to
      the Lord, King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem '
    3: '³ with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand cavalry. A countless army
      came with him from Egypt—Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians. '
    4: '⁴ He took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. '
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the officers of Judah,
      who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says
      the Lord: You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.” '
    6: '⁶ Then the officers of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The
      Lord is in the right.” '
    7: '⁷ When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came
      to Shemaiah, saying: “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them,
      but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out
      on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. '
    8: "⁸ Nevertheless they shall be his servants, so that they may know the difference\
      \ between serving me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures
      of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything.
      He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made; '
    10: '¹⁰ but King Rehoboam made in place of them shields of bronze, and committed
      them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s
      house. '
    11: '¹¹ Whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the guard would come
      along bearing them, and would then bring them back to the guardroom. '
    12: "¹² Because he humbled himself the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so as\
      \ not to destroy them completely; moreover, conditions were good in Judah. \n"
    13: '¹³ So King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam
      was forty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned seventeen years in
      Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel
      to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. '
    14: "¹⁴ He did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the Lord. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in
      the records of the prophet Shemaiah and of the seer Iddo, recorded by genealogy?
      There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. '
    16: ¹⁶ Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David;
      and his son Abijah succeeded him.
  13:
    1: '¹ In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. '
    2: "² He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter\
      \ of Uriel of Gibeah.\nNow there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. "
    3: '³ Abijah engaged in battle, having an army of valiant warriors, four hundred
      thousand picked men; and Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with
      eight hundred thousand picked mighty warriors. '
    4: '⁴ Then Abijah stood on the slope of Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country
      of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel! '
    5: '⁵ Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel
      forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt? '
    6: '⁶ Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and
      rebelled against his lord; '
    7: "⁷ and certain worthless scoundrels gathered around him and defied Rehoboam\
      \ son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand\
      \ them. \n"
    8: '⁸ “And now you think that you can withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the
      hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you
      the golden calves that Jeroboam made as gods for you. '
    9: '⁹ Have you not driven out the priests of the Lord, the descendants of Aaron,
      and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands?
      Whoever comes to be consecrated with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest
      of what are no gods. '
    10: '¹⁰ But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not abandoned him. We
      have priests ministering to the Lord who are descendants of Aaron, and Levites
      for their service. '
    11: '¹¹ They offer to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt offerings
      and fragrant incense, set out the rows of bread on the table of pure gold, and
      care for the golden lampstand so that its lamps may burn every evening; for
      we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but you have abandoned him. '
    12: "¹² See, God is with us at our head, and his priests have their battle trumpets\
      \ to sound the call to battle against you. O Israelites, do not fight against\
      \ the Lord, the God of your ancestors; for you cannot succeed.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come on them from behind; thus his
      troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them. '
    14: '¹⁴ When Judah turned, the battle was in front of them and behind them. They
      cried out to the Lord, and the priests blew the trumpets. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the people of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the people
      of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. '
    16: '¹⁶ The Israelites fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hands. '
    17: '¹⁷ Abijah and his army defeated them with great slaughter; five hundred thousand
      picked men of Israel fell slain. '
    18: '¹⁸ Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the people of Judah
      prevailed, because they relied on the Lord, the God of their ancestors. '
    19: '¹⁹ Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages
      and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages. '
    20: '²⁰ Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah; the Lord struck
      him down, and he died. '
    21: '²¹ But Abijah grew strong. He took fourteen wives, and became the father
      of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. '
    22: ²² The rest of the acts of Abijah, his behavior and his deeds, are written
      in the story of the prophet Iddo.
  14:
    1: '¹ So Abijah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David.
      His son Asa succeeded him. In his days the land had rest for ten years. '
    2: '² Asa did what was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God. '
    3: '³ He took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars,
      hewed down the sacred poles, '
    4: '⁴ and commanded Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to
      keep the law and the commandment. '
    5: '⁵ He also removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense
      altars. And the kingdom had rest under him. '
    6: '⁶ He built fortified cities in Judah while the land had rest. He had no war
      in those years, for the Lord gave him peace. '
    7: '⁷ He said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls
      and towers, gates and bars; the land is still ours because we have sought the
      Lord our God; we have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side.”
      So they built and prospered. '
    8: "⁸ Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, armed with large shields\
      \ and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand troops from Benjamin who carried\
      \ shields and drew bows; all these were mighty warriors. \n"
    9: '⁹ Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men
      and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. '
    10: '¹⁰ Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the
      valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. '
    11: '¹¹ Asa cried to the Lord his God, “O Lord, there is no difference for you
      between helping the mighty and the weak. Help us, O Lord our God, for we rely
      on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Lord, you are
      our God; let no mortal prevail against you.” '
    12: '¹² So the Lord defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the
      Ethiopians fled. '
    13: '¹³ Asa and the army with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians
      fell until no one remained alive; for they were broken before the Lord and his
      army. The people of Judah carried away a great quantity of booty. '
    14: '¹⁴ They defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the Lord was
      on them. They plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them. '
    15: ¹⁵ They also attacked the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away
      sheep and goats in abundance, and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
  15:
    1: '¹ The spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded. '
    2: '² He went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and
      Benjamin: The Lord is with you, while you are with him. If you seek him, he
      will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you. '
    3: '³ For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching
      priest, and without law; '
    4: '⁴ but when in their distress they turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, and
      sought him, he was found by them. '
    5: '⁵ In those times it was not safe for anyone to go or come, for great disturbances
      afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. '
    6: '⁶ They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city,
      for God troubled them with every sort of distress. '
    7: "⁷ But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall\
      \ be rewarded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded, he took
      courage, and put away the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin
      and from the towns that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim. He repaired
      the altar of the Lord that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the
      Lord. '
    9: '⁹ He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and
      Simeon who were residing as aliens with them, for great numbers had deserted
      to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. '
    10: '¹⁰ They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year
      of the reign of Asa. '
    11: '¹¹ They sacrificed to the Lord on that day, from the booty that they had
      brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. '
    12: '¹² They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors,
      with all their heart and with all their soul. '
    13: '¹³ Whoever would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, should be put to death,
      whether young or old, man or woman. '
    14: '¹⁴ They took an oath to the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and
      with trumpets, and with horns. '
    15: "¹⁵ All Judah rejoiced over the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart,\
      \ and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and\
      \ the Lord gave them rest all around. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ King Asa even removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother because
      she had made an abominable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed
      it, and burned it at the Wadi Kidron. '
    17: '¹⁷ But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart
      of Asa was true all his days. '
    18: '¹⁸ He brought into the house of God the votive gifts of his father and his
      own votive gifts—silver, gold, and utensils. '
    19: ¹⁹ And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
  16:
    1: '¹ In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, King Baasha of Israel went
      up against Judah, and built Ramah, to prevent anyone from going out or coming
      into the territory of King Asa of Judah. '
    2: '² Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the Lord
      and the king’s house, and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Aram, who resided in
      Damascus, saying, '
    3: '³ “Let there be an alliance between me and you, like that between my father
      and your father; I am sending to you silver and gold; go, break your alliance
      with King Baasha of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.” '
    4: '⁴ Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against
      the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities
      of Naphtali. '
    5: '⁵ When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease. '
    6: "⁶ Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah\
      \ and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built\
      \ up Geba and Mizpah. \n"
    7: '⁷ At that time the seer Hanani came to King Asa of Judah, and said to him,
      “Because you relied on the king of Aram, and did not rely on the Lord your God,
      the army of the king of Aram has escaped you. '
    8: '⁸ Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with exceedingly many
      chariots and cavalry? Yet because you relied on the Lord, he gave them into
      your hand. '
    9: '⁹ For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the entire earth, to strengthen
      those whose heart is true to him. You have done foolishly in this; for from
      now on you will have wars.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the stocks, in prison,\
      \ for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties\
      \ on some of the people at the same time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings
      of Judah and Israel. '
    12: '¹² In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and
      his disease became severe; yet even in his disease he did not seek the Lord,
      but sought help from physicians. '
    13: '¹³ Then Asa slept with his ancestors, dying in the forty-first year of his
      reign. '
    14: ¹⁴ They buried him in the tomb that he had hewn out for himself in the city
      of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of
      spices prepared by the perfumer’s art; and they made a very great fire in his
      honor.
  17:
    1: '¹ His son Jehoshaphat succeeded him, and strengthened himself against Israel. '
    2: '² He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons
      in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had taken. '
    3: '³ The Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of
      his father; he did not seek the Baals, '
    4: '⁴ but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not
      according to the ways of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought
      tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor. '
    6: "⁶ His heart was courageous in the ways of the Lord; and furthermore he removed\
      \ the high places and the sacred poles from Judah. \n"
    7: '⁷ In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah,
      Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. '
    8: '⁸ With them were the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth,
      Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah; and with these Levites, the
      priests Elishama and Jehoram. '
    9: "⁹ They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the Lord with them;\
      \ they went around through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands around Judah,
      and they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. '
    11: '¹¹ Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute;
      and the Arabs also brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand
      seven hundred male goats. '
    12: '¹² Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built fortresses and storage cities
      in Judah. '
    13: '¹³ He carried out great works in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty
      warriors, in Jerusalem. '
    14: '¹⁴ This was the muster of them by ancestral houses: Of Judah, the commanders
      of the thousands: Adnah the commander, with three hundred thousand mighty warriors, '
    15: '¹⁵ and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with two hundred eighty thousand, '
    16: '¹⁶ and next to him Amasiah son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of
      the Lord, with two hundred thousand mighty warriors. '
    17: '¹⁷ Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty warrior, with two hundred thousand armed
      with bow and shield, '
    18: '¹⁸ and next to him Jehozabad with one hundred eighty thousand armed for war. '
    19: ¹⁹ These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had
      placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
  18:
    1: '¹ Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he made a marriage alliance
      with Ahab. '
    2: '² After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered an abundance
      of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced
      him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. '
    3: "³ King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “Will you go with\
      \ me to Ramoth-gilead?” He answered him, “I am with you, my people are your\
      \ people. We will be with you in the war.” \n"
    4: '⁴ But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the
      word of the Lord.” '
    5: '⁵ Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred of
      them, and said to them, “Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall
      I refrain?” They said, “Go up; for God will give it into the hand of the king.” '
    6: '⁶ But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no other prophet of the Lord here of whom
      we may inquire?” '
    7: '⁷ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one other by whom
      we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never
      prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster.” Jehoshaphat said,
      “Let the king not say such a thing.” '
    8: '⁸ Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah
      son of Imlah.” '
    9: '⁹ Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their
      thrones, arrayed in their robes; and they were sitting at the threshing floor
      at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying
      before them. '
    10: '¹⁰ Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said,
      “Thus says the Lord: With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.” '
    11: "¹¹ All the prophets were prophesying the same and saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead\
      \ and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” \n"
    12: '¹² The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the words
      of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be
      like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” '
    13: "¹³ But Micaiah said, “As the Lord lives, whatever my God says, that I will\
      \ speak.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we
      go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” He answered, “Go up and
      triumph; they will be given into your hand.” '
    15: '¹⁵ But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell
      me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?” '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Micaiah said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like
      sheep without a shepherd; and the Lord said, ‘These have no master; let each
      one go home in peace.’” '
    17: "¹⁷ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would\
      \ not prophesy anything favorable about me, but only disaster?” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord
      sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing to the right and
      to the left of him. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice King Ahab of Israel, so that he may
      go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ Then one said one thing, and another said
      another, '
    20: '²⁰ until a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, ‘I will
      entice him.’ The Lord asked him, ‘How?’ '
    21: '²¹ He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
      prophets.’ Then the Lord said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed;
      go out and do it.’ '
    22: "²² So you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your\
      \ prophets; the Lord has decreed disaster for you.” \n"
    23: '²³ Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up to Micaiah, slapped him on the
      cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak
      to you?” '
    24: '²⁴ Micaiah replied, “You will find out on that day when you go in to hide
      in an inner chamber.” '
    25: '²⁵ The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon
      the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; '
    26: '²⁶ and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him
      on reduced rations of bread and water until I return in peace.’” '
    27: "²⁷ Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.”\
      \ And he said, “Hear, you peoples, all of you!” \n"
    28: '²⁸ So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. '
    29: '²⁹ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go
      into battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself,
      and they went into battle. '
    30: '³⁰ Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, “Fight
      with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.” '
    31: '³¹ When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the
      king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried
      out, and the Lord helped him. God drew them away from him, '
    32: '³² for when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of
      Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. '
    33: '³³ But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel
      between the scale armor and the breastplate; so he said to the driver of his
      chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” '
    34: ³⁴ The battle grew hot that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up
      in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening; then at sunset he died.
  19:
    1: '¹ King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat,
      “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this,
      wrath has gone out against you from the Lord. '
    3: "³ Nevertheless, some good is found in you, for you destroyed the sacred poles\
      \ out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Jehoshaphat resided at Jerusalem; then he went out again among the people,
      from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the
      Lord, the God of their ancestors. '
    5: '⁵ He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city
      by city, '
    6: '⁶ and said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you judge not
      on behalf of human beings but on the Lord’s behalf; he is with you in giving
      judgment. '
    7: "⁷ Now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care what you do, for there\
      \ is no perversion of justice with the Lord our God, or partiality, or taking\
      \ of bribes.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests
      and heads of families of Israel, to give judgment for the Lord and to decide
      disputed cases. They had their seat at Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ He charged them: “This is how you shall act: in the fear of the Lord, in
      faithfulness, and with your whole heart; '
    10: '¹⁰ whenever a case comes to you from your kindred who live in their cities,
      concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or ordinances, then you shall
      instruct them, so that they may not incur guilt before the Lord and wrath may
      not come on you and your kindred. Do so, and you will not incur guilt. '
    11: ¹¹ See, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the Lord; and
      Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all the king’s
      matters; and the Levites will serve you as officers. Deal courageously, and
      may the Lord be with the good!”
  20:
    1: '¹ After this the Moabites and Ammonites, and with them some of the Meunites,
      came against Jehoshaphat for battle. '
    2: '² Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude is coming against
      you from Edom, from beyond the sea; already they are at Hazazon-tamar” (that
      is, En-gedi). '
    3: '³ Jehoshaphat was afraid; he set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed
      a fast throughout all Judah. '
    4: "⁴ Judah assembled to seek help from the Lord; from all the towns of Judah\
      \ they came to seek the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of
      the Lord, before the new court, '
    6: '⁶ and said, “O Lord, God of our ancestors, are you not God in heaven? Do you
      not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? In your hand are power and might,
      so that no one is able to withstand you. '
    7: '⁷ Did you not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your
      people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham? '
    8: '⁸ They have lived in it, and in it have built you a sanctuary for your name,
      saying, '
    9: '⁹ ‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine,
      we will stand before this house, and before you, for your name is in this house,
      and cry to you in our distress, and you will hear and save.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ See now, the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom you would not
      let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided
      and did not destroy— '
    11: '¹¹ they reward us by coming to drive us out of your possession that you have
      given us to inherit. '
    12: "¹² O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them? For we are powerless\
      \ against this great multitude that is coming against us. We do not know what\
      \ to do, but our eyes are on you.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Meanwhile all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their
      wives, and their children. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, son of
      Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the
      middle of the assembly. '
    15: '¹⁵ He said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat:
      Thus says the Lord to you: ‘Do not fear or be dismayed at this great multitude;
      for the battle is not yours but God’s. '
    16: '¹⁶ Tomorrow go down against them; they will come up by the ascent of Ziz;
      you will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. '
    17: "¹⁷ This battle is not for you to fight; take your position, stand still,\
      \ and see the victory of the Lord on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.’ Do\
      \ not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be\
      \ with you.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites, stood up to praise\
      \ the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice. \n"
    20: '²⁰ They rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa;
      and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and
      inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God and you will be established;
      believe his prophets.” '
    21: "²¹ When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were\
      \ to sing to the Lord and praise him in holy splendor, as they went before the\
      \ army, saying,\n“Give thanks to the Lord,\n    for his steadfast love endures\
      \ forever.” \n"
    22: '²² As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set an ambush against the Ammonites,
      Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed. '
    23: "²³ For the Ammonites and Moab attacked the inhabitants of Mount Seir, destroying\
      \ them utterly; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they\
      \ all helped to destroy one another. \n"
    24: '²⁴ When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward
      the multitude; they were corpses lying on the ground; no one had escaped. '
    25: '²⁵ When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the booty from them, they
      found livestock in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which
      they took for themselves until they could carry no more. They spent three days
      taking the booty, because of its abundance. '
    26: '²⁶ On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, for there they
      blessed the Lord; therefore that place has been called the Valley of Beracah
      to this day. '
    27: '²⁷ Then all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their
      head, returned to Jerusalem with joy, for the Lord had enabled them to rejoice
      over their enemies. '
    28: '²⁸ They came to Jerusalem, with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house
      of the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ The fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard
      that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. '
    30: "³⁰ And the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all\
      \ around. \n"
    31: '³¹ So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he
      began to reign; he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name
      was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. '
    32: '³² He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it,
      doing what was right in the sight of the Lord. '
    33: "³³ Yet the high places were not removed; the people had not yet set their\
      \ hearts upon the God of their ancestors. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written\
      \ in the Annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the\
      \ Kings of Israel. \n"
    35: '³⁵ After this King Jehoshaphat of Judah joined with King Ahaziah of Israel,
      who did wickedly. '
    36: '³⁶ He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish; they built the ships
      in Ezion-geber. '
    37: ³⁷ Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
      saying, “Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy what you
      have made.” And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.
  21:
    1: '¹ Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in
      the city of David; his son Jehoram succeeded him. '
    2: '² He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah,
      Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. '
    3: '³ Their father gave them many gifts, of silver, gold, and valuable possessions,
      together with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram,
      because he was the firstborn. '
    4: '⁴ When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established,
      he put all his brothers to the sword, and also some of the officials of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned eight
      years in Jerusalem. '
    6: '⁶ He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done;
      for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. He did what was evil in the sight of
      the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ Yet the Lord would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant\
      \ that he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him\
      \ and to his descendants forever. \n"
    8: '⁸ In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king of
      their own. '
    9: '⁹ Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. He set
      out by night and attacked the Edomites, who had surrounded him and his chariot
      commanders. '
    10: "¹⁰ So Edom has been in revolt against the rule of Judah to this day. At that\
      \ time Libnah also revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the Lord,\
      \ the God of his ancestors. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moreover he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and led the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, and made Judah go astray. '
    12: '¹² A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah, saying: “Thus says the Lord,
      the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of your
      father Jehoshaphat or in the ways of King Asa of Judah, '
    13: '¹³ but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, as the house of Ahab led
      Israel into unfaithfulness, and because you also have killed your brothers,
      members of your father’s house, who were better than yourself, '
    14: '¹⁴ see, the Lord will bring a great plague on your people, your children,
      your wives, and all your possessions, '
    15: "¹⁵ and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels,\
      \ until your bowels come out, day after day, because of the disease.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord aroused against Jehoram the anger of the Philistines and of the
      Arabs who are near the Ethiopians. '
    17: "¹⁷ They came up against Judah, invaded it, and carried away all the possessions\
      \ they found that belonged to the king’s house, along with his sons and his\
      \ wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ After all this the Lord struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease. '
    19: '¹⁹ In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because
      of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor,
      like the fires made for his ancestors. '
    20: ²⁰ He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned eight years
      in Jerusalem. He departed with no one’s regret. They buried him in the city
      of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
  22:
    1: '¹ The inhabitants of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king as his successor;
      for the troops who came with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older
      sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram reigned as king of Judah. '
    2: '² Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned one year
      in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri. '
    3: '³ He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his
      counselor in doing wickedly. '
    4: '⁴ He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had
      done; for after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his ruin. '
    5: '⁵ He even followed their advice, and went with Jehoram son of King Ahab of
      Israel to make war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans
      wounded Joram, '
    6: "⁶ and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received\
      \ at Ramah, when he fought King Hazael of Aram. And Ahaziah son of King Jehoram\
      \ of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about
      through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there he went out with Jehoram
      to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house
      of Ahab. '
    8: '⁸ When Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the officials
      of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed
      them. '
    9: "⁹ He searched for Ahaziah, who was captured while hiding in Samaria and was\
      \ brought to Jehu, and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is\
      \ the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart.” And\
      \ the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now when Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was dead, she set
      about to destroy all the royal family of the house of Judah. '
    11: '¹¹ But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash son of Ahaziah, and
      stole him away from among the king’s children who were about to be killed; she
      put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, daughter of King Jehoram
      and wife of the priest Jehoiada—because she was a sister of Ahaziah—hid him
      from Athaliah, so that she did not kill him; '
    12: ¹² he remained with them six years, hidden in the house of God, while Athaliah
      reigned over the land.
  23:
    1: '¹ But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage, and entered into a compact
      with the commanders of the hundreds, Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of
      Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of
      Zichri. '
    2: '² They went around through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the towns
      of Judah, and the heads of families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ Then the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
      Jehoiada said to them, “Here is the king’s son! Let him reign, as the Lord promised
      concerning the sons of David. '
    4: '⁴ This is what you are to do: one-third of you, priests and Levites, who come
      on duty on the sabbath, shall be gatekeepers, '
    5: '⁵ one-third shall be at the king’s house, and one-third at the Gate of the
      Foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Do not let anyone enter the house of the Lord except the priests and ministering
      Levites; they may enter, for they are holy, but all the other people shall observe
      the instructions of the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand;\
      \ and whoever enters the house shall be killed. Stay with the king in his comings\
      \ and goings.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The Levites and all Judah did according to all that the priest Jehoiada
      commanded; each brought his men, who were to come on duty on the sabbath, with
      those who were to go off duty on the sabbath; for the priest Jehoiada did not
      dismiss the divisions. '
    9: '⁹ The priest Jehoiada delivered to the captains the spears and the large and
      small shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of God; '
    10: '¹⁰ and he set all the people as a guard for the king, everyone with weapon
      in hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around
      the altar and the house. '
    11: "¹¹ Then he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him\
      \ the covenant; they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed\
      \ him; and they shouted, “Long live the king!” \n"
    12: '¹² When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king,
      she went into the house of the Lord to the people; '
    13: '¹³ and when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the
      entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people
      of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical
      instruments leading in the celebration. Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried,
      “Treason! Treason!” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the priest Jehoiada brought out the captains who were set over the
      army, saying to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; anyone who follows her
      is to be put to the sword.” For the priest said, “Do not put her to death in
      the house of the Lord.” '
    15: "¹⁵ So they laid hands on her; she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate\
      \ of the king’s house, and there they put her to death. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king
      that they should be the Lord’s people. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars
      and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal,
      in front of the altars. '
    18: '¹⁸ Jehoiada assigned the care of the house of the Lord to the levitical priests
      whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the Lord, to offer
      burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing
      and with singing, according to the order of David. '
    19: '¹⁹ He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord so
      that no one should enter who was in any way unclean. '
    20: '²⁰ And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and
      all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of
      the Lord, marching through the upper gate to the king’s house. They set the
      king on the royal throne. '
    21: ²¹ So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah
      had been killed with the sword.
  24:
    1: '¹ Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years
      in Jerusalem; his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. '
    2: '² Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of the priest
      Jehoiada. '
    3: "³ Jehoiada got two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Some time afterward Joash decided to restore the house of the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ He assembled the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the
      cities of Judah and gather money from all Israel to repair the house of your
      God, year by year; and see that you act quickly.” But the Levites did not act
      quickly. '
    6: '⁶ So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why have you
      not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied
      by Moses, the servant of the Lord, on the congregation of Israel for the tent
      of the covenant?” '
    7: "⁷ For the children of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house\
      \ of God, and had even used all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord\
      \ for the Baals. \n"
    8: '⁸ So the king gave command, and they made a chest, and set it outside the
      gate of the house of the Lord. '
    9: '⁹ A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the
      Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness. '
    10: '¹⁰ All the leaders and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and
      dropped it into the chest until it was full. '
    11: '¹¹ Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the Levites,
      when they saw that there was a large amount of money in it, the king’s secretary
      and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take
      it and return it to its place. So they did day after day, and collected money
      in abundance. '
    12: '¹² The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the
      house of the Lord, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house
      of the Lord, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the
      Lord. '
    13: '¹³ So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went
      forward at their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition
      and strengthened it. '
    14: "¹⁴ When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king\
      \ and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the Lord, utensils\
      \ for the service and for the burnt offerings, and ladles, and vessels of gold\
      \ and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord regularly\
      \ all the days of Jehoiada. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died; he was one hundred thirty
      years old at his death. '
    16: "¹⁶ And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had\
      \ done good in Israel, and for God and his house. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and did obeisance
      to the king; then the king listened to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ They abandoned the house of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and
      served the sacred poles and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem
      for this guilt of theirs. '
    19: "¹⁹ Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the Lord; they testified\
      \ against them, but they would not listen. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the spirit of God took possession of Zechariah son of the priest
      Jehoiada; he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus says God: Why do
      you transgress the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot prosper? Because
      you have forsaken the Lord, he has also forsaken you.” '
    21: '²¹ But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned
      him to death in the court of the house of the Lord. '
    22: "²² King Joash did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah’s father,\
      \ had shown him, but killed his son. As he was dying, he said, “May the Lord\
      \ see and avenge!” \n"
    23: '²³ At the end of the year the army of Aram came up against Joash. They came
      to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the officials of the people from among
      them, and sent all the booty they took to the king of Damascus. '
    24: "²⁴ Although the army of Aram had come with few men, the Lord delivered into\
      \ their hand a very great army, because they had abandoned the Lord, the God\
      \ of their ancestors. Thus they executed judgment on Joash. \n"
    25: '²⁵ When they had withdrawn, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired
      against him because of the blood of the son of the priest Jehoiada, and they
      killed him on his bed. So he died; and they buried him in the city of David,
      but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. '
    26: '²⁶ Those who conspired against him were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonite,
      and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabite. '
    27: ²⁷ Accounts of his sons, and of the many oracles against him, and of the rebuilding
      of the house of God are written in the Commentary on the Book of the Kings.
      And his son Amaziah succeeded him.
  25:
    1: '¹ Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
      twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. '
    2: '² He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not with a true heart. '
    3: '³ As soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants
      who had murdered his father the king. '
    4: "⁴ But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written\
      \ in the law, in the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, “The parents shall\
      \ not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for\
      \ the parents; but all shall be put to death for their own sins.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Amaziah assembled the people of Judah, and set them by ancestral houses
      under commanders of the thousands and of the hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin.
      He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were three
      hundred thousand picked troops fit for war, able to handle spear and shield. '
    6: '⁶ He also hired one hundred thousand mighty warriors from Israel for one hundred
      talents of silver. '
    7: '⁷ But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel
      go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—all these Ephraimites. '
    8: '⁸ Rather, go by yourself and act; be strong in battle, or God will fling you
      down before the enemy; for God has power to help or to overthrow.” '
    9: '⁹ Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred
      talents that I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “The
      Lord is able to give you much more than this.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim, letting\
      \ them go home again. But they became very angry with Judah, and returned home\
      \ in fierce anger. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Amaziah took courage, and led out his people; he went to the Valley of
      Salt, and struck down ten thousand men of Seir. '
    12: '¹² The people of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, took them to
      the top of Sela, and threw them down from the top of Sela, so that all of them
      were dashed to pieces. '
    13: "¹³ But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with\
      \ him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon; they\
      \ killed three thousand people in them, and took much booty. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought
      the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his gods, and worshiped them,
      making offerings to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to
      him, “Why have you resorted to a people’s gods who could not deliver their own
      people from your hand?” '
    16: "¹⁶ But as he was speaking the king said to him, “Have we made you a royal\
      \ counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?” So the prophet stopped,\
      \ but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have\
      \ done this and have not listened to my advice.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then King Amaziah of Judah took counsel and sent to King Joash son of
      Jehoahaz son of Jehu of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the
      face.” '
    18: '¹⁸ King Joash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, “A thornbush
      on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son
      for a wife’; but a wild animal of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thornbush. '
    19: "¹⁹ You say, ‘See, I have defeated Edom,’ and your heart has lifted you up\
      \ in boastfulness. Now stay at home; why should you provoke trouble so that\
      \ you fall, you and Judah with you?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ But Amaziah would not listen—it was God’s doing, in order to hand them
      over, because they had sought the gods of Edom. '
    21: '²¹ So King Joash of Israel went up; he and King Amaziah of Judah faced one
      another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. '
    22: '²² Judah was defeated by Israel; everyone fled home. '
    23: '²³ King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Joash, son
      of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh; he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the
      wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of four
      hundred cubits. '
    24: "²⁴ He seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found\
      \ in the house of God, and Obed-edom with them; he seized also the treasuries\
      \ of the king’s house, also hostages; then he returned to Samaria. \n"
    25: '²⁵ King Amaziah son of Joash of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death
      of King Joash son of Jehoahaz of Israel. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not
      written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? '
    27: '²⁷ From the time that Amaziah turned away from the Lord they made a conspiracy
      against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to
      Lachish, and killed him there. '
    28: ²⁸ They brought him back on horses; he was buried with his ancestors in the
      city of David.
  26:
    1: '¹ Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and
      made him king to succeed his father Amaziah. '
    2: '² He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his
      ancestors. '
    3: '³ Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah
      had done. '
    5: "⁵ He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him\
      \ in the fear of God; and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ He went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall
      of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; he built cities in the
      territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. '
    7: '⁷ God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who lived in Gur-baal,
      and against the Meunites. '
    8: '⁸ The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border
      of Egypt, for he became very strong. '
    9: '⁹ Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley
      Gate, and at the Angle, and fortified them. '
    10: '¹⁰ He built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns, for he
      had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers
      and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. '
    11: '¹¹ Moreover Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according
      to the numbers in the muster made by the secretary Jeiel and the officer Maaseiah,
      under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders. '
    12: '¹² The whole number of the heads of ancestral houses of mighty warriors was
      two thousand six hundred. '
    13: '¹³ Under their command was an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred,
      who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. '
    14: '¹⁴ Uzziah provided for all the army the shields, spears, helmets, coats of
      mail, bows, and stones for slinging. '
    15: "¹⁵ In Jerusalem he set up machines, invented by skilled workers, on the towers\
      \ and the corners for shooting arrows and large stones. And his fame spread\
      \ far, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But when he had become strong he grew proud, to his destruction. For he
      was false to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to make offering
      on the altar of incense. '
    17: '¹⁷ But the priest Azariah went in after him, with eighty priests of the Lord
      who were men of valor; '
    18: '¹⁸ they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah,
      to make offering to the Lord, but for the priests the descendants of Aaron,
      who are consecrated to make offering. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have
      done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the Lord God.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to make offering,
      and when he became angry with the priests a leprous disease broke out on his
      forehead, in the presence of the priests in the house of the Lord, by the altar
      of incense. '
    20: '²⁰ When the chief priest Azariah, and all the priests, looked at him, he
      was leprous in his forehead. They hurried him out, and he himself hurried to
      get out, because the Lord had struck him. '
    21: "²¹ King Uzziah was leprous to the day of his death, and being leprous lived\
      \ in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the Lord. His son\
      \ Jotham was in charge of the palace of the king, governing the people of the\
      \ land. \n"
    22: '²² Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah
      son of Amoz wrote. '
    23: ²³ Uzziah slept with his ancestors; they buried him near his ancestors in
      the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is leprous.”
      His son Jotham succeeded him.
  27:
    1: '¹ Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok. '
    2: '² He did what was right in the sight of the Lord just as his father Uzziah
      had done—only he did not invade the temple of the Lord. But the people still
      followed corrupt practices. '
    3: '³ He built the upper gate of the house of the Lord, and did extensive building
      on the wall of Ophel. '
    4: '⁴ Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers
      on the wooded hills. '
    5: '⁵ He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. The
      Ammonites gave him that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors
      of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount
      in the second and the third years. '
    6: '⁶ So Jotham became strong because he ordered his ways before the Lord his
      God. '
    7: '⁷ Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are written
      in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. '
    8: '⁸ He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen
      years in Jerusalem. '
    9: ⁹ Jotham slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David;
      and his son Ahaz succeeded him.
  28:
    1: '¹ Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; he reigned sixteen years
      in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord, as his
      ancestor David had done, '
    2: '² but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made cast images
      for the Baals; '
    3: '³ and he made offerings in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his sons
      pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom
      the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. '
    4: "⁴ He sacrificed and made offerings on the high places, on the hills, and under\
      \ every green tree. \n"
    5: '⁵ Therefore the Lord his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram, who
      defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them
      to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated
      him with great slaughter. '
    6: '⁶ Pekah son of Remaliah killed one hundred twenty thousand in Judah in one
      day, all of them valiant warriors, because they had abandoned the Lord, the
      God of their ancestors. '
    7: "⁷ And Zichri, a mighty warrior of Ephraim, killed the king’s son Maaseiah,\
      \ Azrikam the commander of the palace, and Elkanah the next in authority to\
      \ the king. \n"
    8: '⁸ The people of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kin, women,
      sons, and daughters; they also took much booty from them and brought the booty
      to Samaria. '
    9: '⁹ But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded; he went out to
      meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, “Because the Lord, the
      God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but
      you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and
      female, as your slaves. But what have you except sins against the Lord your
      God? '
    11: '¹¹ Now hear me, and send back the captives whom you have taken from your
      kindred, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.” '
    12: '¹² Moreover, certain chiefs of the Ephraimites, Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah
      son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai, stood
      up against those who were coming from the war, '
    13: '¹³ and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose
      to bring on us guilt against the Lord in addition to our present sins and guilt.
      For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the warriors left the captives and the booty before the officials and
      all the assembly. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then those who were mentioned by name got up and took the captives, and\
      \ with the booty they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them,\
      \ gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and\
      \ carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their\
      \ kindred at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried away
      captives. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and
      the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with
      its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they
      settled there. '
    19: '¹⁹ For the Lord brought Judah low because of King Ahaz of Israel, for he
      had behaved without restraint in Judah and had been faithless to the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ So King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria came against him, and oppressed him
      instead of strengthening him. '
    21: "²¹ For Ahaz plundered the house of the Lord and the houses of the king and\
      \ of the officials, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria; but it did not\
      \ help him. \n"
    22: '²² In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the Lord—this
      same King Ahaz. '
    23: '²³ For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had defeated him, and
      said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to
      them so that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. '
    24: '²⁴ Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, and cut in pieces
      the utensils of the house of God. He shut up the doors of the house of the Lord
      and made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. '
    25: '²⁵ In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other
      gods, provoking to anger the Lord, the God of his ancestors. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, are written
      in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. '
    27: ²⁷ Ahaz slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem;
      but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah
      succeeded him.
  29:
    1: '¹ Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; he reigned twenty-nine
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. '
    2: "² He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestor David\
      \ had done. \n"
    3: '³ In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors
      of the house of the Lord and repaired them. '
    4: '⁴ He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square
      on the east. '
    5: '⁵ He said to them, “Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify
      the house of the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and carry out the filth from
      the holy place. '
    6: '⁶ For our ancestors have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the
      sight of the Lord our God; they have forsaken him, and have turned away their
      faces from the dwelling of the Lord, and turned their backs. '
    7: '⁷ They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps, and have
      not offered incense or made burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of
      Israel. '
    8: '⁸ Therefore the wrath of the Lord came upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has
      made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with
      your own eyes. '
    9: '⁹ Our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and
      our wives are in captivity for this. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel,
      so that his fierce anger may turn away from us. '
    11: "¹¹ My sons, do not now be negligent, for the Lord has chosen you to stand\
      \ in his presence to minister to him, and to be his ministers and make offerings\
      \ to him.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Levites arose, Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah,
      of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish son of Abdi,
      and Azariah son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah, and
      Eden son of Joah; '
    13: '¹³ and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph,
      Zechariah and Mattaniah; '
    14: '¹⁴ and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun,
      Shemaiah and Uzziel. '
    15: '¹⁵ They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in as the
      king had commanded, by the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ The priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse
      it, and they brought out all the unclean things that they found in the temple
      of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord; and the Levites took them
      and carried them out to the Wadi Kidron. '
    17: '¹⁷ They began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the
      eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the Lord; then for eight
      days they sanctified the house of the Lord, and on the sixteenth day of the
      first month they finished. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all
      the house of the Lord, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and
      the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils. '
    19: "¹⁹ All the utensils that King Ahaz repudiated during his reign when he was\
      \ faithless, we have made ready and sanctified; see, they are in front of the\
      \ altar of the Lord.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then King Hezekiah rose early, assembled the officials of the city, and
      went up to the house of the Lord. '
    21: '²¹ They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats
      for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded
      the priests the descendants of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the Lord. '
    22: '²² So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and
      dashed it against the altar; they slaughtered the rams and their blood was dashed
      against the altar; they also slaughtered the lambs and their blood was dashed
      against the altar. '
    23: '²³ Then the male goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and
      the assembly; they laid their hands on them, '
    24: "²⁴ and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood\
      \ at the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that\
      \ the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. \n"
    25: '²⁵ He stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, harps,
      and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king’s seer
      and of the prophet Nathan, for the commandment was from the Lord through his
      prophets. '
    26: '²⁶ The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with
      the trumpets. '
    27: '²⁷ Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar.
      When the burnt offering began, the song to the Lord began also, and the trumpets,
      accompanied by the instruments of King David of Israel. '
    28: '²⁸ The whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded;
      all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. '
    29: '²⁹ When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with
      him bowed down and worshiped. '
    30: "³⁰ King Hezekiah and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises\
      \ to the Lord with the words of David and of the seer Asaph. They sang praises\
      \ with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Hezekiah said, “You have now consecrated yourselves to the Lord;
      come near, bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the Lord.” The
      assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings; and all who were of a willing
      heart brought burnt offerings. '
    32: '³² The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy
      bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering
      to the Lord. '
    33: '³³ The consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. '
    34: '³⁴ But the priests were too few and could not skin all the burnt offerings,
      so, until other priests had sanctified themselves, their kindred, the Levites,
      helped them until the work was finished—for the Levites were more conscientious
      than the priests in sanctifying themselves. '
    35: '³⁵ Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of the offerings
      of well-being, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus
      the service of the house of the Lord was restored. '
    36: ³⁶ And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for
      the people; for the thing had come about suddenly.
  30:
    1: '¹ Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim
      and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to
      keep the passover to the Lord the God of Israel. '
    2: '² For the king and his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken
      counsel to keep the passover in the second month '
    3: '³ (for they could not keep it at its proper time because the priests had not
      sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in
      Jerusalem). '
    4: '⁴ The plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly. '
    5: '⁵ So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba
      to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the Lord the God
      of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed. '
    6: '⁶ So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king
      and his officials, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel, return
      to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may turn again
      to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. '
    7: '⁷ Do not be like your ancestors and your kindred, who were faithless to the
      Lord God of their ancestors, so that he made them a desolation, as you see. '
    8: '⁸ Do not now be stiff-necked as your ancestors were, but yield yourselves
      to the Lord and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and
      serve the Lord your God, so that his fierce anger may turn away from you. '
    9: "⁹ For as you return to the Lord, your kindred and your children will find\
      \ compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For the Lord your\
      \ God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if\
      \ you return to him.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim
      and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked
      them. '
    11: '¹¹ Only a few from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came
      to Jerusalem. '
    12: "¹² The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the\
      \ king and the officials commanded by the word of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the festival of unleavened
      bread in the second month, a very large assembly. '
    14: '¹⁴ They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all
      the altars for offering incense they took away and threw into the Wadi Kidron. '
    15: '¹⁵ They slaughtered the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second
      month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they sanctified themselves
      and brought burnt offerings into the house of the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man
      of God; the priests dashed the blood that they received from the hands of the
      Levites. '
    17: '¹⁷ For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves;
      therefore the Levites had to slaughter the passover lamb for everyone who was
      not clean, to make it holy to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ For a multitude of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar,
      and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise
      than as prescribed. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “The good Lord pardon
      all '
    19: '¹⁹ who set their hearts to seek God, the Lord the God of their ancestors,
      even though not in accordance with the sanctuary’s rules of cleanness.” '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord heard Hezekiah, and healed the people. '
    21: '²¹ The people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the festival of
      unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests
      praised the Lord day by day, accompanied by loud instruments for the Lord. '
    22: "²² Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill\
      \ in the service of the Lord. So the people ate the food of the festival for\
      \ seven days, sacrificing offerings of well-being and giving thanks to the Lord\
      \ the God of their ancestors. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the festival for another
      seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness. '
    24: '²⁴ For King Hezekiah of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven
      thousand sheep for offerings, and the officials gave the assembly a thousand
      bulls and ten thousand sheep. The priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. '
    25: '²⁵ The whole assembly of Judah, the priests and the Levites, and the whole
      assembly that came out of Israel, and the resident aliens who came out of the
      land of Israel, and the resident aliens who lived in Judah, rejoiced. '
    26: '²⁶ There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon son of
      King David of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. '
    27: ²⁷ Then the priests and the Levites stood up and blessed the people, and their
      voice was heard; their prayer came to his holy dwelling in heaven.
  31:
    1: "¹ Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to\
      \ the cities of Judah and broke down the pillars, hewed down the sacred poles,\
      \ and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin,\
      \ and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the\
      \ people of Israel returned to their cities, all to their individual properties.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division
      by division, everyone according to his service, the priests and the Levites,
      for burnt offerings and offerings of well-being, to minister in the gates of
      the camp of the Lord and to give thanks and praise. '
    3: '³ The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt
      offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings
      for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals, as it is written
      in the law of the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ He commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to
      the priests and the Levites, so that they might devote themselves to the law
      of the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ As soon as the word spread, the people of Israel gave in abundance the first
      fruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and
      they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. '
    6: '⁶ The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought
      in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that
      had been consecrated to the Lord their God, and laid them in heaps. '
    7: '⁷ In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in
      the seventh month. '
    8: '⁸ When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they blessed the
      Lord and his people Israel. '
    9: '⁹ Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. '
    10: "¹⁰ The chief priest Azariah, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him,\
      \ “Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the Lord, we\
      \ have had enough to eat and have plenty to spare; for the Lord has blessed\
      \ his people, so that we have this great supply left over.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare store-chambers in the house of
      the Lord; and they prepared them. '
    12: '¹² Faithfully they brought in the contributions, the tithes and the dedicated
      things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with his
      brother Shimei as second; '
    13: '¹³ while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah,
      Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and his brother Shimei,
      by the appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief officer of the
      house of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was in charge of
      the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the
      Lord and the most holy offerings. '
    15: '¹⁵ Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully
      assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their
      kindred, old and young alike, by divisions, '
    16: '¹⁶ except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upwards,
      all who entered the house of the Lord as the duty of each day required, for
      their service according to their offices, by their divisions. '
    17: '¹⁷ The enrollment of the priests was according to their ancestral houses;
      that of the Levites from twenty years old and upwards was according to their
      offices, by their divisions. '
    18: '¹⁸ The priests were enrolled with all their little children, their wives,
      their sons, and their daughters, the whole multitude; for they were faithful
      in keeping themselves holy. '
    19: "¹⁹ And for the descendants of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields\
      \ of common land belonging to their towns, town by town, the people designated\
      \ by name were to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to\
      \ everyone among the Levites who was enrolled. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah; he did what was good and right
      and faithful before the Lord his God. '
    21: ²¹ And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God, and
      in accordance with the law and the commandments, to seek his God, he did with
      all his heart; and he prospered.
  32:
    1: '¹ After these things and these acts of faithfulness, King Sennacherib of Assyria
      came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to
      win them for himself. '
    2: '² When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against
      Jerusalem, '
    3: '³ he planned with his officers and his warriors to stop the flow of the springs
      that were outside the city; and they helped him. '
    4: '⁴ A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and
      the wadi that flowed through the land, saying, “Why should the Assyrian kings
      come and find water in abundance?” '
    5: '⁵ Hezekiah set to work resolutely and built up the entire wall that was broken
      down, and raised towers on it, and outside it he built another wall; he also
      strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in
      abundance. '
    6: '⁶ He appointed combat commanders over the people, and gathered them together
      to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them,
      saying, '
    7: '⁷ “Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the
      king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is one greater
      with us than with him. '
    8: "⁸ With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God, to help us\
      \ and to fight our battles.” The people were encouraged by the words of King\
      \ Hezekiah of Judah. \n"
    9: '⁹ After this, while King Sennacherib of Assyria was at Lachish with all his
      forces, he sent his servants to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all
      the people of Judah that were in Jerusalem, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus says King Sennacherib of Assyria: On what are you relying, that
      you undergo the siege of Jerusalem? '
    11: '¹¹ Is not Hezekiah misleading you, handing you over to die by famine and
      by thirst, when he tells you, ‘The Lord our God will save us from the hand of
      the king of Assyria’? '
    12: '¹² Was it not this same Hezekiah who took away his high places and his altars
      and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘Before one altar you shall worship,
      and upon it you shall make your offerings’? '
    13: '¹³ Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of
      other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to save
      their lands out of my hand? '
    14: '¹⁴ Who among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors utterly destroyed
      was able to save his people from my hand, that your God should be able to save
      you from my hand? '
    15: "¹⁵ Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion,\
      \ and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able\
      \ to save his people from my hand or from the hand of my ancestors. How much\
      \ less will your God save you out of my hand!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ His servants said still more against the Lord God and against his servant
      Hezekiah. '
    17: '¹⁷ He also wrote letters to throw contempt on the Lord the God of Israel
      and to speak against him, saying, “Just as the gods of the nations in other
      lands did not rescue their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will
      not rescue his people from my hand.” '
    18: '¹⁸ They shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people
      of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that
      they might take the city. '
    19: "¹⁹ They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as if he were like the gods of the\
      \ peoples of the earth, which are the work of human hands. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed because of
      this and cried to heaven. '
    21: '²¹ And the Lord sent an angel who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders
      and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in disgrace
      to his own land. When he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons
      struck him down there with the sword. '
    22: '²² So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand
      of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies; he gave
      them rest on every side. '
    23: "²³ Many brought gifts to the Lord in Jerusalem and precious things to King\
      \ Hezekiah of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from\
      \ that time onward. \n"
    24: '²⁴ In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. He prayed
      to the Lord, and he answered him and gave him a sign. '
    25: '²⁵ But Hezekiah did not respond according to the benefit done to him, for
      his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. '
    26: "²⁶ Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and\
      \ the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come upon\
      \ them in the days of Hezekiah. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Hezekiah had very great riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries
      for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for
      all kinds of costly objects; '
    28: '²⁸ storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for
      all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds. '
    29: '²⁹ He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance;
      for God had given him very great possessions. '
    30: '³⁰ This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and
      directed them down to the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered
      in all his works. '
    31: "³¹ So also in the matter of the envoys of the officials of Babylon, who had\
      \ been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land,\
      \ God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in\
      \ his heart. \n"
    32: '³² Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, are written
      in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of
      Judah and Israel. '
    33: ³³ Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him on the ascent to
      the tombs of the descendants of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of
      Jerusalem did him honor at his death. His son Manasseh succeeded him.
  33:
    1: '¹ Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five
      years in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the abominable
      practices of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. '
    3: '³ For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had pulled down,
      and erected altars to the Baals, made sacred poles, worshiped all the host of
      heaven, and served them. '
    4: '⁴ He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, “In
      Jerusalem shall my name be forever.” '
    5: '⁵ He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house
      of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ He made his son pass through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, practiced
      soothsaying and augury and sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with wizards.
      He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger. '
    7: '⁷ The carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God,
      of which God said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this house, and in Jerusalem,
      which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever; '
    8: '⁸ I will never again remove the feet of Israel from the land that I appointed
      for your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded
      them, all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses.” '
    9: "⁹ Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did\
      \ more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the people of\
      \ Israel. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they gave no heed. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore the Lord brought against them the commanders of the army of
      the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh captive in manacles, bound him with fetters,
      and brought him to Babylon. '
    12: '¹² While he was in distress he entreated the favor of the Lord his God and
      humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. '
    13: "¹³ He prayed to him, and God received his entreaty, heard his plea, and restored\
      \ him again to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord\
      \ indeed was God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon,
      in the valley, reaching the entrance at the Fish Gate; he carried it around
      Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. He also put commanders of the army
      in all the fortified cities in Judah. '
    15: '¹⁵ He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord,
      and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord
      and in Jerusalem, and he threw them out of the city. '
    16: '¹⁶ He also restored the altar of the Lord and offered on it sacrifices of
      well-being and of thanksgiving; and he commanded Judah to serve the Lord the
      God of Israel. '
    17: "¹⁷ The people, however, still sacrificed at the high places, but only to\
      \ the Lord their God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words
      of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, these are
      in the Annals of the Kings of Israel. '
    19: '¹⁹ His prayer, and how God received his entreaty, all his sin and his faithlessness,
      the sites on which he built high places and set up the sacred poles and the
      images, before he humbled himself, these are written in the records of the seers. '
    20: "²⁰ So Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in his house.\
      \ His son Amon succeeded him. \n"
    21: '²¹ Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; he reigned two years
      in Jerusalem. '
    22: '²² He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh
      had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images that his father Manasseh had made,
      and served them. '
    23: '²³ He did not humble himself before the Lord, as his father Manasseh had
      humbled himself, but this Amon incurred more and more guilt. '
    24: '²⁴ His servants conspired against him and killed him in his house. '
    25: ²⁵ But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King
      Amon; and the people of the land made his son Josiah king to succeed him.
  34:
    1: '¹ Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned thirty-one
      years in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of
      his ancestor David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left. '
    3: '³ For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began
      to seek the God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year he began to purge
      Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the sacred poles, and the carved and
      the cast images. '
    4: '⁴ In his presence they pulled down the altars of the Baals; he demolished
      the incense altars that stood above them. He broke down the sacred poles and
      the carved and the cast images; he made dust of them and scattered it over the
      graves of those who had sacrificed to them. '
    5: '⁵ He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah
      and Jerusalem. '
    6: '⁶ In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in
      their ruins all around, '
    7: "⁷ he broke down the altars, beat the sacred poles and the images into powder,\
      \ and demolished all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then\
      \ he returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    8: '⁸ In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the
      house, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and
      Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God. '
    9: '⁹ They came to the high priest Hilkiah and delivered the money that had been
      brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold,
      had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and
      from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ They delivered it to the workers who had the oversight of the house of
      the Lord, and the workers who were working in the house of the Lord gave it
      for repairing and restoring the house. '
    11: '¹¹ They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone,
      and timber for binders, and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah
      had let go to ruin. '
    12: '¹² The people did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed the Levites
      Jahath and Obadiah, of the sons of Merari, along with Zechariah and Meshullam,
      of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. Other Levites, all skillful
      with instruments of music, '
    13: "¹³ were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind\
      \ of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the
      house of the Lord, the priest Hilkiah found the book of the law of the Lord
      given through Moses. '
    15: '¹⁵ Hilkiah said to the secretary Shaphan, “I have found the book of the law
      in the house of the Lord”; and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. '
    16: '¹⁶ Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king,
      “All that was committed to your servants they are doing. '
    17: '¹⁷ They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the Lord
      and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workers.” '
    18: "¹⁸ The secretary Shaphan informed the king, “The priest Hilkiah has given\
      \ me a book.” Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When the king heard the words of the law he tore his clothes. '
    20: '²⁰ Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah,
      the secretary Shaphan, and the king’s servant Asaiah: '
    21: "²¹ “Go, inquire of the Lord for me and for those who are left in Israel and\
      \ in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found; for the wrath\
      \ of the Lord that is poured out on us is great, because our ancestors did not\
      \ keep the word of the Lord, to act in accordance with all that is written in\
      \ this book.” \n"
    22: '²² So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to the prophet Huldah,
      the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (who
      lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect. '
    23: '²³ She declared to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the
      man who sent you to me, '
    24: '²⁴ Thus says the Lord: I will indeed bring disaster upon this place and upon
      its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that was read before
      the king of Judah. '
    25: '²⁵ Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, so
      that they have provoked me to anger with all the works of their hands, my wrath
      will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched. '
    26: '²⁶ But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus
      shall you say to him: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Regarding the words
      that you have heard, '
    27: '²⁷ because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when
      you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled
      yourself before me, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have
      heard you, says the Lord. '
    28: "²⁸ I will gather you to your ancestors and you shall be gathered to your\
      \ grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring\
      \ on this place and its inhabitants.” They took the message back to the king.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then the king sent word and gathered together all the elders of Judah
      and Jerusalem. '
    30: '³⁰ The king went up to the house of the Lord, with all the people of Judah,
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, all the people both
      great and small; he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant
      that had been found in the house of the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ The king stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord, to follow
      the Lord, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all
      his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written
      in this book. '
    32: '³² Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin pledge
      themselves to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant
      of God, the God of their ancestors. '
    33: ³³ Josiah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged
      to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel worship the Lord their
      God. All his days they did not turn away from following the Lord the God of
      their ancestors.
  35:
    1: '¹ Josiah kept a passover to the Lord in Jerusalem; they slaughtered the passover
      lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. '
    2: '² He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service
      of the house of the Lord. '
    3: '³ He said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the Lord,
      “Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon son of David, king of Israel, built;
      you need no longer carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and
      his people Israel. '
    4: '⁴ Make preparations by your ancestral houses by your divisions, following
      the written directions of King David of Israel and the written directions of
      his son Solomon. '
    5: '⁵ Take position in the holy place according to the groupings of the ancestral
      houses of your kindred the people, and let there be Levites for each division
      of an ancestral house. '
    6: "⁶ Slaughter the passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and on behalf of your\
      \ kindred make preparations, acting according to the word of the Lord by Moses.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Josiah contributed to the people, as passover offerings for all that
      were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand,
      and three thousand bulls; these were from the king’s possessions. '
    8: '⁸ His officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to
      the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house
      of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred
      lambs and kids and three hundred bulls. '
    9: "⁹ Conaniah also, and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and\
      \ Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the\
      \ passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place,
      and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command. '
    11: '¹¹ They slaughtered the passover lamb, and the priests dashed the blood that
      they received from them, while the Levites did the skinning. '
    12: '¹² They set aside the burnt offerings so that they might distribute them
      according to the groupings of the ancestral houses of the people, to offer to
      the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. And they did the same with
      the bulls. '
    13: '¹³ They roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and
      they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried
      them quickly to all the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because
      the priests the descendants of Aaron were occupied in offering the burnt offerings
      and the fat parts until night; so the Levites made preparations for themselves
      and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. '
    15: "¹⁵ The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were in their place according to\
      \ the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and the king’s seer Jeduthun.\
      \ The gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to interrupt their service,\
      \ for their kindred the Levites made preparations for them. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So all the service of the Lord was prepared that day, to keep the passover
      and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, according to the command
      of King Josiah. '
    17: '¹⁷ The people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time,
      and the festival of unleavened bread seven days. '
    18: '¹⁸ No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of the prophet
      Samuel; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by
      Josiah, by the priests and the Levites, by all Judah and Israel who were present,
      and by the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    19: "¹⁹ In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this passover was kept.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, King Neco of
      Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against
      him. '
    21: '²¹ But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king
      of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which
      I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with
      me, so that he will not destroy you.” '
    22: '²² But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order
      to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of
      God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. '
    23: '²³ The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take
      me away, for I am badly wounded.” '
    24: '²⁴ So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second
      chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs
      of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. '
    25: '²⁵ Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah, and all the singing men and
      singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made
      these a custom in Israel; they are recorded in the Laments. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his faithful deeds in accordance
      with what is written in the law of the Lord, '
    27: ²⁷ and his acts, first and last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel
      and Judah.
  36:
    1: '¹ The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king to
      succeed his father in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; he reigned three
      months in Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid on the land a tribute
      of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. '
    4: "⁴ The king of Egypt made his brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem,\
      \ and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and\
      \ carried him to Egypt. \n"
    5: '⁵ Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven
      years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. '
    6: '⁶ Against him King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up, and bound him with fetters
      to take him to Babylon. '
    7: '⁷ Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the house of the Lord
      to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon. '
    8: "⁸ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations that he did,\
      \ and what was found against him, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel\
      \ and Judah; and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him. \n"
    9: '⁹ Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned three
      months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to\
      \ Babylon, along with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made\
      \ his brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem. \n"
