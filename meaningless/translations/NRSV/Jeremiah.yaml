Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth
      in the land of Benjamin, '
    2: '² to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of King Josiah son of Amon
      of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. '
    3: "³ It came also in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, and until\
      \ the end of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, until\
      \ the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now the word of the Lord came to me saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nand before you were born I\
      \ consecrated you;\nI appointed you a prophet to the nations.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only
      a boy.” '
    7: "⁷ But the Lord said to me,\n“Do not say, ‘I am only a boy’;\nfor you shall\
      \ go to all to whom I send you,\nand you shall speak whatever I command you.\n"
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid of them,\nfor I am with you to deliver you,\nsays the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to\
      \ me,\n“Now I have put my words in your mouth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms,\nto pluck up\
      \ and to pull down,\nto destroy and to overthrow,\nto build and to plant.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ The word of the Lord came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”
      And I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over
      my word to perform it.” '
    13: "¹³ The word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?”\
      \ And I said, “I see a boiling pot, tilted away from the north.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north disaster shall break out on
      all the inhabitants of the land. '
    15: '¹⁵ For now I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, says
      the Lord; and they shall come and all of them shall set their thrones at the
      entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its surrounding walls and against
      all the cities of Judah. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I will utter my judgments against them, for all their wickedness in
      forsaking me; they have made offerings to other gods, and worshiped the works
      of their own hands. '
    17: '¹⁷ But you, gird up your loins; stand up and tell them everything that I
      command you. Do not break down before them, or I will break you before them. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I for my part have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar,
      and a bronze wall, against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes,
      its priests, and the people of the land. '
    19: ¹⁹ They will fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you, for
      I am with you, says the Lord, to deliver you.
  2:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    2: "² Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the Lord:\nI remember\
      \ the devotion of your youth,\n    your love as a bride,\nhow you followed me\
      \ in the wilderness,\n    in a land not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holy to the Lord,\n    the first fruits of his harvest.\nAll\
      \ who ate of it were held guilty;\n    disaster came upon them,\nsays the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the
      house of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord:\nWhat wrong did your ancestors find in me\n    that\
      \ they went far from me,\nand went after worthless things, and became worthless\
      \ themselves?\n"
    6: "⁶ They did not say, “Where is the Lord\n    who brought us up from the land\
      \ of Egypt,\nwho led us in the wilderness,\n    in a land of deserts and pits,\n\
      in a land of drought and deep darkness,\n    in a land that no one passes through,\n\
      \    where no one lives?”\n"
    7: "⁷ I brought you into a plentiful land\n    to eat its fruits and its good\
      \ things.\nBut when you entered you defiled my land,\n    and made my heritage\
      \ an abomination.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not say, “Where is the Lord?”\n    Those who handle the\
      \ law did not know me;\nthe rulers transgressed against me;\n    the prophets\
      \ prophesied by Baal,\n    and went after things that do not profit. \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore once more I accuse you,\nsays the Lord,\n    and I accuse your\
      \ children’s children.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look,\n    send to Kedar and examine\
      \ with care;\n    see if there has ever been such a thing.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation changed its gods,\n    even though they are no gods?\nBut\
      \ my people have changed their glory\n    for something that does not profit.\n"
    12: "¹² Be appalled, O heavens, at this,\n    be shocked, be utterly desolate,\n\
      says the Lord,\n"
    13: "¹³ for my people have committed two evils:\n    they have forsaken me,\n\
      the fountain of living water,\n    and dug out cisterns for themselves,\ncracked\
      \ cisterns\n    that can hold no water. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?\n    Why then has he become\
      \ plunder?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The lions have roared against him,\n    they have roared loudly.\nThey\
      \ have made his land a waste;\n    his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes\n    have broken the crown\
      \ of your head.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Have you not brought this upon yourself\n    by forsaking the Lord your\
      \ God,\n    while he led you in the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ What then do you gain by going to Egypt,\n    to drink the waters of the\
      \ Nile?\nOr what do you gain by going to Assyria,\n    to drink the waters of\
      \ the Euphrates?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your wickedness will punish you,\n    and your apostasies will convict\
      \ you.\nKnow and see that it is evil and bitter\n    for you to forsake the\
      \ Lord your God;\n    the fear of me is not in you,\nsays the Lord God of hosts.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ For long ago you broke your yoke\n    and burst your bonds,\n    and you\
      \ said, “I will not serve!”\nOn every high hill\n    and under every green tree\n\
      \    you sprawled and played the whore.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I planted you as a choice vine,\n    from the purest stock.\nHow then\
      \ did you turn degenerate\n    and become a wild vine?\n"
    22: "²² Though you wash yourself with lye\n    and use much soap,\n    the stain\
      \ of your guilt is still before me,\nsays the Lord God.\n"
    23: "²³ How can you say, “I am not defiled,\n    I have not gone after the Baals”?\n\
      Look at your way in the valley;\n    know what you have done—\na restive young\
      \ camel interlacing her tracks,\n"
    24: "²⁴     a wild ass at home in the wilderness,\nin her heat sniffing the wind!\n\
      \    Who can restrain her lust?\nNone who seek her need weary themselves;\n\
      \    in her month they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Keep your feet from going unshod\n    and your throat from thirst.\nBut\
      \ you said, “It is hopeless,\n    for I have loved strangers,\n    and after\
      \ them I will go.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ As a thief is shamed when caught,\n    so the house of Israel shall be\
      \ shamed—\nthey, their kings, their officials,\n    their priests, and their\
      \ prophets,\n"
    27: "²⁷ who say to a tree, “You are my father,”\n    and to a stone, “You gave\
      \ me birth.”\nFor they have turned their backs to me,\n    and not their faces.\n\
      But in the time of their trouble they say,\n    “Come and save us!”\n"
    28: "²⁸ But where are your gods\n    that you made for yourself?\nLet them come,\
      \ if they can save you,\n    in your time of trouble;\nfor you have as many\
      \ gods\n    as you have towns, O Judah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Why do you complain against me?\n    You have all rebelled against me,\n\
      says the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ In vain I have struck down your children;\n    they accepted no correction.\n\
      Your own sword devoured your prophets\n    like a ravening lion.\n"
    31: "³¹ And you, O generation, behold the word of the Lord!\nHave I been a wilderness\
      \ to Israel,\n    or a land of thick darkness?\nWhy then do my people say, “We\
      \ are free,\n    we will come to you no more”?\n"
    32: "³² Can a girl forget her ornaments,\n    or a bride her attire?\nYet my people\
      \ have forgotten me,\n    days without number. \n"
    33: "³³ How well you direct your course\n    to seek lovers!\nSo that even to\
      \ wicked women\n    you have taught your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Also on your skirts is found\n    the lifeblood of the innocent poor,\n\
      though you did not catch them breaking in.\n    Yet in spite of all these things\n"
    35: "³⁵ you say, “I am innocent;\n    surely his anger has turned from me.”\n\
      Now I am bringing you to judgment\n    for saying, “I have not sinned.”\n"
    36: "³⁶ How lightly you gad about,\n    changing your ways!\nYou shall be put\
      \ to shame by Egypt\n    as you were put to shame by Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ From there also you will come away\n    with your hands on your head;\n\
      for the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust,\n    and you will not prosper\
      \ through them."
  3:
    1: "¹ If a man divorces his wife\n    and she goes from him\nand becomes another\
      \ man’s wife,\n    will he return to her?\nWould not such a land be greatly\
      \ polluted?\nYou have played the whore with many lovers;\n    and would you\
      \ return to me?\nsays the Lord.\n"
    2: "² Look up to the bare heights, and see!\n    Where have you not been lain\
      \ with?\nBy the waysides you have sat waiting for lovers,\n    like a nomad\
      \ in the wilderness.\nYou have polluted the land\n    with your whoring and\
      \ wickedness.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withheld,\n    and the spring rain has not\
      \ come;\nyet you have the forehead of a whore,\n    you refuse to be ashamed.\n"
    4: "⁴ Have you not just now called to me,\n    “My Father, you are the friend\
      \ of my youth—\n"
    5: "⁵ will he be angry forever,\n    will he be indignant to the end?”\nThis is\
      \ how you have spoken,\n    but you have done all the evil that you could. \n"
    6: '⁶ The Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what she did,
      that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every
      green tree, and played the whore there? '
    7: '⁷ And I thought, “After she has done all this she will return to me”; but
      she did not return, and her false sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had
      sent her away with a decree of divorce; yet her false sister Judah did not fear,
      but she too went and played the whore. '
    9: '⁹ Because she took her whoredom so lightly, she polluted the land, committing
      adultery with stone and tree. '
    10: "¹⁰ Yet for all this her false sister Judah did not return to me with her\
      \ whole heart, but only in pretense, says the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the Lord said to me: Faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty
      than false Judah. '
    12: "¹² Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say:\nReturn, faithless\
      \ Israel,\nsays the Lord.\nI will not look on you in anger,\n    for I am merciful,\n\
      says the Lord;\nI will not be angry forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your guilt,\n    that you have rebelled against the Lord\
      \ your God,\nand scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree,\n\
      \    and have not obeyed my voice,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Return, O faithless children,\nsays the Lord,\n    for I am your master;\n\
      I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,\n    and I will bring\
      \ you to Zion. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge
      and understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,
      says the Lord, they shall no longer say, “The ark of the covenant of the Lord.”
      It shall not come to mind, or be remembered, or missed; nor shall another one
      be made. '
    17: '¹⁷ At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord, and all
      nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the Lord in Jerusalem, and they
      shall no longer stubbornly follow their own evil will. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together\
      \ they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your ancestors\
      \ for a heritage. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I thought\n    how I would set you among my children,\nand give you a\
      \ pleasant land,\n    the most beautiful heritage of all the nations.\nAnd I\
      \ thought you would call me, My Father,\n    and would not turn from following\
      \ me.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Instead, as a faithless wife leaves her husband,\n    so you have been\
      \ faithless to me, O house of Israel,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ A voice on the bare heights is heard,\n    the plaintive weeping of Israel’s\
      \ children,\nbecause they have perverted their way,\n    they have forgotten\
      \ the Lord their God:\n"
    22: "²² Return, O faithless children,\n    I will heal your faithlessness.\n“Here\
      \ we come to you;\n    for you are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Truly the hills are a delusion,\n    the orgies on the mountains.\nTruly\
      \ in the Lord our God\n    is the salvation of Israel. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our
      ancestors had labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. '
    25: ²⁵ Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us; for we have
      sinned against the Lord our God, we and our ancestors, from our youth even to
      this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”
  4:
    1: "¹ If you return, O Israel,\nsays the Lord,\n    if you return to me,\nif you\
      \ remove your abominations from my presence,\n    and do not waver,\n"
    2: "² and if you swear, “As the Lord lives!”\n    in truth, in justice, and in\
      \ uprightness,\nthen nations shall be blessed by him,\n    and by him they shall\
      \ boast. \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of\
      \ Jerusalem:\nBreak up your fallow ground,\n    and do not sow among thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,\n    remove the foreskin of your hearts,\n\
      \    O people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nor else my wrath will\
      \ go forth like fire,\n    and burn with no one to quench it,\n    because of\
      \ the evil of your doings. \n"
    5: "⁵ Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say:\nBlow the trumpet\
      \ through the land;\n    shout aloud and say,\n“Gather together, and let us\
      \ go\n    into the fortified cities!”\n"
    6: "⁶ Raise a standard toward Zion,\n    flee for safety, do not delay,\nfor I\
      \ am bringing evil from the north,\n    and a great destruction.\n"
    7: "⁷ A lion has gone up from its thicket,\n    a destroyer of nations has set\
      \ out;\n    he has gone out from his place\nto make your land a waste;\n   \
      \ your cities will be ruins\n    without inhabitant.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because of this put on sackcloth,\n    lament and wail:\n“The fierce anger\
      \ of the Lord\n    has not turned away from us.” \n"
    9: '⁹ On that day, says the Lord, courage shall fail the king and the officials;
      the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God, how utterly you have deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It shall be well with you,’ even while the sword is\
      \ at the throat!” \n"
    11: '¹¹ At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A hot wind
      comes from me out of the bare heights in the desert toward my poor people, not
      to winnow or cleanse— '
    12: "¹² a wind too strong for that. Now it is I who speak in judgment against\
      \ them. \n"
    13: "¹³ Look! He comes up like clouds,\n    his chariots like the whirlwind;\n\
      his horses are swifter than eagles—\n    woe to us, for we are ruined!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ O Jerusalem, wash your heart clean of wickedness\n    so that you may\
      \ be saved.\nHow long shall your evil schemes\n    lodge within you?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For a voice declares from Dan\n    and proclaims disaster from Mount Ephraim.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Tell the nations, “Here they are!”\n    Proclaim against Jerusalem,\n\
      “Besiegers come from a distant land;\n    they shout against the cities of Judah.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They have closed in around her like watchers of a field,\n    because\
      \ she has rebelled against me,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your ways and your doings\n    have brought this upon you.\nThis is your\
      \ doom; how bitter it is!\n    It has reached your very heart.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!\n    Oh, the walls of my heart!\n\
      My heart is beating wildly;\n    I cannot keep silent;\nfor I hear the sound\
      \ of the trumpet,\n    the alarm of war.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Disaster overtakes disaster,\n    the whole land is laid waste.\nSuddenly\
      \ my tents are destroyed,\n    my curtains in a moment.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long must I see the standard,\n    and hear the sound of the trumpet?\n"
    22: "²² “For my people are foolish,\n    they do not know me;\nthey are stupid\
      \ children,\n    they have no understanding.\nThey are skilled in doing evil,\n\
      \    but do not know how to do good.” \n"
    23: "²³ I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void;\n    and to the\
      \ heavens, and they had no light.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking,\n    and all the\
      \ hills moved to and fro.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I looked, and lo, there was no one at all,\n    and all the birds of the\
      \ air had fled.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert,\n    and all its cities\
      \ were laid in ruins\n    before the Lord, before his fierce anger. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For thus says the Lord: The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will\
      \ not make a full end. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Because of this the earth shall mourn,\n    and the heavens above grow\
      \ black;\nfor I have spoken, I have purposed;\n    I have not relented nor will\
      \ I turn back. \n"
    29: "²⁹ At the noise of horseman and archer\n    every town takes to flight;\n\
      they enter thickets; they climb among rocks;\n    all the towns are forsaken,\n\
      \    and no one lives in them.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And you, O desolate one,\nwhat do you mean that you dress in crimson,\n\
      \    that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold,\n    that you enlarge your\
      \ eyes with paint?\nIn vain you beautify yourself.\n    Your lovers despise\
      \ you;\n    they seek your life.\n"
    31: "³¹ For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor,\n    anguish as of one bringing\
      \ forth her first child,\nthe cry of daughter Zion gasping for breath,\n   \
      \ stretching out her hands,\n“Woe is me! I am fainting before killers!”"
  5:
    1: "¹ Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,\n    look around and take\
      \ note!\nSearch its squares and see\n    if you can find one person\nwho acts\
      \ justly\n    and seeks truth—\nso that I may pardon Jerusalem.\n"
    2: "² Although they say, “As the Lord lives,”\n    yet they swear falsely.\n"
    3: "³ O Lord, do your eyes not look for truth?\nYou have struck them,\n    but\
      \ they felt no anguish;\nyou have consumed them,\n    but they refused to take\
      \ correction.\nThey have made their faces harder than rock;\n    they have refused\
      \ to turn back. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I said, “These are only the poor,\n    they have no sense;\nfor they\
      \ do not know the way of the Lord,\n    the law of their God.\n"
    5: "⁵ Let me go to the rich\n    and speak to them;\nsurely they know the way\
      \ of the Lord,\n    the law of their God.”\nBut they all alike had broken the\
      \ yoke,\n    they had burst the bonds. \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion from the forest shall kill them,\n    a wolf from the desert\
      \ shall destroy them.\nA leopard is watching against their cities;\n    everyone\
      \ who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces—\nbecause their transgressions\
      \ are many,\n    their apostasies are great. \n"
    7: "⁷ How can I pardon you?\n    Your children have forsaken me,\n    and have\
      \ sworn by those who are no gods.\nWhen I fed them to the full,\n    they committed\
      \ adultery\n    and trooped to the houses of prostitutes.\n"
    8: "⁸ They were well-fed lusty stallions,\n    each neighing for his neighbor’s\
      \ wife.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things?\nsays the Lord;\n    and shall\
      \ I not bring retribution\n    on a nation such as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Go up through her vine-rows and destroy,\n    but do not make a full end;\n\
      strip away her branches,\n    for they are not the Lord’s.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the house of Israel and the house of Judah\n    have been utterly\
      \ faithless to me,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² They have spoken falsely of the Lord,\n    and have said, “He will do\
      \ nothing.\nNo evil will come upon us,\n    and we shall not see sword or famine.”\n"
    13: "¹³ The prophets are nothing but wind,\n    for the word is not in them.\n\
      Thus shall it be done to them! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts:\nBecause they have spoken\
      \ this word,\nI am now making my words in your mouth a fire,\n    and this people\
      \ wood, and the fire shall devour them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I am going to bring upon you\n    a nation from far away, O house of Israel,\n\
      says the Lord.\nIt is an enduring nation,\n    it is an ancient nation,\na nation\
      \ whose language you do not know,\n    nor can you understand what they say.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Their quiver is like an open tomb;\n    all of them are mighty warriors.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They shall eat up your harvest and your food;\n    they shall eat up your\
      \ sons and your daughters;\nthey shall eat up your flocks and your herds;\n\
      \    they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees;\nthey shall destroy with\
      \ the sword\n    your fortified cities in which you trust. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But even in those days, says the Lord, I will not make a full end of you. '
    19: "¹⁹ And when your people say, “Why has the Lord our God done all these things\
      \ to us?” you shall say to them, “As you have forsaken me and served foreign\
      \ gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.”\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Declare this in the house of Jacob,\n    proclaim it in Judah:\n"
    21: "²¹ Hear this, O foolish and senseless people,\n    who have eyes, but do\
      \ not see,\n    who have ears, but do not hear.\n"
    22: "²² Do you not fear me? says the Lord;\n    Do you not tremble before me?\n\
      I placed the sand as a boundary for the sea,\n    a perpetual barrier that it\
      \ cannot pass;\nthough the waves toss, they cannot prevail,\n    though they\
      \ roar, they cannot pass over it.\n"
    23: "²³ But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart;\n    they have turned\
      \ aside and gone away.\n"
    24: "²⁴ They do not say in their hearts,\n    “Let us fear the Lord our God,\n\
      who gives the rain in its season,\n    the autumn rain and the spring rain,\n\
      and keeps for us\n    the weeks appointed for the harvest.”\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your iniquities have turned these away,\n    and your sins have deprived\
      \ you of good.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For scoundrels are found among my people;\n    they take over the goods\
      \ of others.\nLike fowlers they set a trap;\n    they catch human beings.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Like a cage full of birds,\n    their houses are full of treachery;\n\
      therefore they have become great and rich,\n"
    28: "²⁸     they have grown fat and sleek.\nThey know no limits in deeds of wickedness;\n\
      \    they do not judge with justice\nthe cause of the orphan, to make it prosper,\n\
      \    and they do not defend the rights of the needy.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things?\nsays the Lord,\n    and shall\
      \ I not bring retribution\n    on a nation such as this? \n"
    30: "³⁰ An appalling and horrible thing\n    has happened in the land:\n"
    31: "³¹ the prophets prophesy falsely,\n    and the priests rule as the prophets\
      \ direct;\nmy people love to have it so,\n    but what will you do when the\
      \ end comes?"
  6:
    1: "¹ Flee for safety, O children of Benjamin,\n    from the midst of Jerusalem!\n\
      Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,\n    and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem;\nfor evil\
      \ looms out of the north,\n    and great destruction.\n"
    2: "² I have likened daughter Zion\n    to the loveliest pasture.\n"
    3: "³ Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her.\n    They shall pitch\
      \ their tents around her;\n    they shall pasture, all in their places.\n"

    5: "⁵ “Up, and let us attack by night,\n    and destroy her palaces!”\n"
    6: "⁶ For thus says the Lord of hosts:\nCut down her trees;\n    cast up a siege\
      \ ramp against Jerusalem.\nThis is the city that must be punished;\n    there\
      \ is nothing but oppression within her.\n"
    7: "⁷ As a well keeps its water fresh,\n    so she keeps fresh her wickedness;\n\
      violence and destruction are heard within her;\n    sickness and wounds are\
      \ ever before me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Take warning, O Jerusalem,\n    or I shall turn from you in disgust,\nand\
      \ make you a desolation,\n    an uninhabited land. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord of hosts:\nGlean thoroughly as a vine\n    the remnant\

      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ To whom shall I speak and give warning,\n    that they may hear?\nSee,\
      \ their ears are closed,\n    they cannot listen.\nThe word of the Lord is to\
      \ them an object of scorn;\n    they take no pleasure in it.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But I am full of the wrath of the Lord;\n    I am weary of holding it\
      \ in.\nPour it out on the children in the street,\n    and on the gatherings\
      \ of young men as well;\nboth husband and wife shall be taken,\n    the old\
      \ folk and the very aged.\n"
    12: "¹² Their houses shall be turned over to others,\n    their fields and wives\
      \ together;\nfor I will stretch out my hand\n    against the inhabitants of\
      \ the land,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ For from the least to the greatest of them,\n    everyone is greedy for\
      \ unjust gain;\nand from prophet to priest,\n    everyone deals falsely.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They have treated the wound of my people carelessly,\n    saying, “Peace,\
      \ peace,”\n    when there is no peace.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ They acted shamefully, they committed abomination;\n    yet they were\
      \ not ashamed,\n    they did not know how to blush.\nTherefore they shall fall\
      \ among those who fall;\n    at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,\n\

    16: "¹⁶ Thus says the Lord:\nStand at the crossroads, and look,\n    and ask for\
      \ the ancient paths,\nwhere the good way lies; and walk in it,\n    and find\
      \ rest for your souls.\nBut they said, “We will not walk in it.”\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Also I raised up sentinels for you:\n    “Give heed to the sound of the\
      \ trumpet!”\nBut they said, “We will not give heed.”\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore hear, O nations,\n    and know, O congregation, what will happen\
      \ to them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Hear, O earth; I am going to bring disaster on this people,\n    the fruit\
      \ of their schemes,\nbecause they have not given heed to my words;\n    and\

    20: "²⁰ Of what use to me is frankincense that comes from Sheba,\n    or sweet\

    21: "²¹ Therefore thus says the Lord:\nSee, I am laying before this people\n \
      \   stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble;\nparents and children\
      \ together,\n    neighbor and friend shall perish. \n"
    22: "²² Thus says the Lord:\nSee, a people is coming from the land of the north,\n\
      \    a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.\n"
    23: "²³ They grasp the bow and the javelin,\n    they are cruel and have no mercy,\n\
      \    their sound is like the roaring sea;\nthey ride on horses,\n    equipped\
      \ like a warrior for battle,\n    against you, O daughter Zion! \n"
    24: "²⁴ “We have heard news of them,\n    our hands fall helpless;\nanguish has\

    25: "²⁵ Do not go out into the field,\n    or walk on the road;\nfor the enemy\

    26: "²⁶ O my poor people, put on sackcloth,\n    and roll in ashes;\nmake mourning\
      \ as for an only child,\n    most bitter lamentation:\nfor suddenly the destroyer\n\
      \    will come upon us. \n"
    27: "²⁷ I have made you a tester and a refiner among my people\n    so that you\
      \ may know and test their ways.\n"
    28: "²⁸ They are all stubbornly rebellious,\n    going about with slanders;\n\
      they are bronze and iron,\n    all of them act corruptly.\n"
    29: "²⁹ The bellows blow fiercely,\n    the lead is consumed by the fire;\nin\
      \ vain the refining goes on,\n    for the wicked are not removed.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They are called “rejected silver,”\n    for the Lord has rejected them."
  7:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² Stand in the gate of the Lord’s house, and proclaim there this word, and
      say, Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah, you that enter these
      gates to worship the Lord. '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your
      doings, and let me dwell with you in this place. '
    4: "⁴ Do not trust in these deceptive words: “This is the temple of the Lord,\
      \ the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.” \n"
    5: '⁵ For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly
      one with another, '
    6: '⁶ if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent
      blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt, '
    7: "⁷ then I will dwell with you in this place, in the land that I gave of old\
      \ to your ancestors forever and ever. \n"
    8: '⁸ Here you are, trusting in deceptive words to no avail. '
    9: '⁹ Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to
      Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, '
    10: '¹⁰ and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
      name, and say, “We are safe!”—only to go on doing all these abominations? '
    11: '¹¹ Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in
      your sight? You know, I too am watching, says the Lord. '
    12: '¹² Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first,
      and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. '
    13: '¹³ And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and when
      I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you
      did not answer, '
    14: '¹⁴ therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you
      trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what
      I did to Shiloh. '
    15: "¹⁵ And I will cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your kinsfolk,\
      \ all the offspring of Ephraim. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry or prayer
      on their behalf, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets
      of Jerusalem? '
    18: '¹⁸ The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead
      dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings
      to other gods, to provoke me to anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ Is it I whom they provoke? says the Lord. Is it not themselves, to their
      own hurt? '
    20: "²⁰ Therefore thus says the Lord God: My anger and my wrath shall be poured\
      \ out on this place, on human beings and animals, on the trees of the field\
      \ and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched. \n"
    21: '²¹ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings
      to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. '
    22: '²² For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt,
      I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. '
    23: '²³ But this command I gave them, “Obey my voice, and I will be your God,
      and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so
      that it may be well with you.” '
    24: '²⁴ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but, in the stubbornness of
      their evil will, they walked in their own counsels, and looked backward rather
      than forward. '
    25: '²⁵ From the day that your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this
      day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after
      day; '
    26: "²⁶ yet they did not listen to me, or pay attention, but they stiffened their\
      \ necks. They did worse than their ancestors did. \n"
    27: '²⁷ So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to
      you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you. '
    28: "²⁸ You shall say to them: This is the nation that did not obey the voice\
      \ of the Lord their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished;\
      \ it is cut off from their lips. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Cut off your hair and throw it away;\n    raise a lamentation on the bare\
      \ heights,\nfor the Lord has rejected and forsaken\n    the generation that\
      \ provoked his wrath. \n"
    30: '³⁰ For the people of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the Lord; they
      have set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, defiling
      it. '
    31: '³¹ And they go on building the high place of Topheth, which is in the valley
      of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire—which
      I did not command, nor did it come into my mind. '
    32: '³² Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the Lord, when it will no
      more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of
      Slaughter: for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more room. '
    33: '³³ The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and
      for the animals of the earth; and no one will frighten them away. '
    34: ³⁴ And I will bring to an end the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of
      the bride and bridegroom in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
      for the land shall become a waste.
  8:
    1: '¹ At that time, says the Lord, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones
      of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the
      bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs; '
    2: '² and they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of
      heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have followed, and which
      they have inquired of and worshiped; and they shall not be gathered or buried;
      they shall be like dung on the surface of the ground. '
    3: "³ Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this\
      \ evil family in all the places where I have driven them, says the Lord of hosts.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ You shall say to them, Thus says the Lord:\nWhen people fall, do they not\
      \ get up again?\n    If they go astray, do they not turn back?\n"
    5: "⁵ Why then has this people turned away\n    in perpetual backsliding?\nThey\
      \ have held fast to deceit,\n    they have refused to return.\n"
    6: "⁶ I have given heed and listened,\n    but they do not speak honestly;\nno\
      \ one repents of wickedness,\n    saying, “What have I done!”\nAll of them turn\
      \ to their own course,\n    like a horse plunging headlong into battle.\n"
    7: "⁷ Even the stork in the heavens\n    knows its times;\nand the turtledove,\
      \ swallow, and crane\n    observe the time of their coming;\nbut my people do\
      \ not know\n    the ordinance of the Lord. \n"
    8: "⁸ How can you say, “We are wise,\n    and the law of the Lord is with us,”\n\
      when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes\n    has made it into a lie?\n"
    9: "⁹ The wise shall be put to shame,\n    they shall be dismayed and taken;\n\
      since they have rejected the word of the Lord,\n    what wisdom is in them?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I will give their wives to others\n    and their fields to conquerors,\n\
      because from the least to the greatest\n    everyone is greedy for unjust gain;\n\
      from prophet to priest\n    everyone deals falsely.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They have treated the wound of my people carelessly,\n    saying, “Peace,\
      \ peace,”\n    when there is no peace.\n"
    12: "¹² They acted shamefully, they committed abomination;\n    yet they were\
      \ not at all ashamed,\n    they did not know how to blush.\nTherefore they shall\
      \ fall among those who fall;\n    at the time when I punish them, they shall\
      \ be overthrown,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ When I wanted to gather them, says the Lord,\n    there are no grapes\
      \ on the vine,\n    nor figs on the fig tree;\neven the leaves are withered,\n\
      \    and what I gave them has passed away from them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Why do we sit still?\nGather together, let us go into the fortified cities\n\
      \    and perish there;\nfor the Lord our God has doomed us to perish,\n    and\
      \ has given us poisoned water to drink,\n    because we have sinned against\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ We look for peace, but find no good,\n    for a time of healing, but there\
      \ is terror instead. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan;\n    at the sound of the\
      \ neighing of their stallions\n    the whole land quakes.\nThey come and devour\
      \ the land and all that fills it,\n    the city and those who live in it.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ See, I am letting snakes loose among you,\n    adders that cannot be charmed,\n\
      \    and they shall bite you,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ My joy is gone, grief is upon me,\n    my heart is sick.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Hark, the cry of my poor people\n    from far and wide in the land:\n\
      “Is the Lord not in Zion?\n    Is her King not in her?”\n(“Why have they provoked\
      \ me to anger with their images,\n    with their foreign idols?”)\n"
    20: "²⁰ “The harvest is past, the summer is ended,\n    and we are not saved.”\n"
    21: "²¹ For the hurt of my poor people I am hurt,\n    I mourn, and dismay has\
      \ taken hold of me. \n"
    22: "²² Is there no balm in Gilead?\n    Is there no physician there?\nWhy then\
      \ has the health of my poor people\n    not been restored?"
  9:
    1: "¹ O that my head were a spring of water,\n    and my eyes a fountain of tears,\n\
      so that I might weep day and night\n    for the slain of my poor people!\n"
    2: "² O that I had in the desert\n    a traveler’s lodging place,\nthat I might\
      \ leave my people\n    and go away from them!\nFor they are all adulterers,\n\
      \    a band of traitors.\n"
    3: "³ They bend their tongues like bows;\n    they have grown strong in the land\
      \ for falsehood, and not for truth;\nfor they proceed from evil to evil,\n \
      \   and they do not know me, says the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ Beware of your neighbors,\n    and put no trust in any of your kin;\nfor\
      \ all your kin are supplanters,\n    and every neighbor goes around like a slanderer.\n"
    5: "⁵ They all deceive their neighbors,\n    and no one speaks the truth;\nthey\
      \ have taught their tongues to speak lies;\n    they commit iniquity and are\
      \ too weary to repent.\n"
    6: "⁶ Oppression upon oppression, deceit upon deceit!\n    They refuse to know\
      \ me, says the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts:\nI will now refine and test them,\n\
      \    for what else can I do with my sinful people?\n"
    8: "⁸ Their tongue is a deadly arrow;\n    it speaks deceit through the mouth.\n\
      They all speak friendly words to their neighbors,\n    but inwardly are planning\

    9: "⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord;\n    and shall\

    10: "¹⁰ Take up weeping and wailing for the mountains,\n    and a lamentation\
      \ for the pastures of the wilderness,\nbecause they are laid waste so that no\
      \ one passes through,\n    and the lowing of cattle is not heard;\nboth the\

    11: "¹¹ I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,\n    a lair of jackals;\nand I\
      \ will make the towns of Judah a desolation,\n    without inhabitant. \n"
    12: '¹² Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the Lord
      spoken, so that they may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like
      a wilderness, so that no one passes through? '
    13: '¹³ And the Lord says: Because they have forsaken my law that I set before
      them, and have not obeyed my voice, or walked in accordance with it, '
    14: '¹⁴ but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the
      Baals, as their ancestors taught them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I am feeding
      this people with wormwood, and giving them poisonous water to drink. '
    16: "¹⁶ I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors\

    17: "¹⁷ Thus says the Lord of hosts:\nConsider, and call for the mourning women\

      \ down with tears,\n    and our eyelids flow with water.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion:\n    “How we are ruined!\n\

      \ have cast down our dwellings.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Hear, O women, the word of the Lord,\n    and let your ears receive the\

    22: "²² Speak! Thus says the Lord:\n“Human corpses shall fall\n    like dung upon\
      \ the open field,\nlike sheaves behind the reaper,\n    and no one shall gather\
      \ them.” \n"
    23: '²³ Thus says the Lord: Do not let the wise boast in their wisdom, do not
      let the mighty boast in their might, do not let the wealthy boast in their wealth; '
    24: "²⁴ but let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me,\
      \ that I am the Lord; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness\
      \ in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will attend to all those
      who are circumcised only in the foreskin: '
    26: ²⁶ Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all those with shaven temples
      who live in the desert. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the
      house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.
  10:
    1: '¹ Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O house of Israel. '
    2: "² Thus says the Lord:\nDo not learn the way of the nations,\n    or be dismayed\
      \ at the signs of the heavens;\n    for the nations are dismayed at them.\n"
    3: "³ For the customs of the peoples are false:\na tree from the forest is cut\

    4: "⁴ people deck it with silver and gold;\n    they fasten it with hammer and\

      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ There is none like you, O Lord;\n    you are great, and your name is great\
      \ in might.\n"
    7: "⁷ Who would not fear you, O King of the nations?\n    For that is your due;\n\

      \ is no one like you.\n"
    8: "⁸ They are both stupid and foolish;\n    the instruction given by idols\n\
      \    is no better than wood!\n"
    9: "⁹ Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish,\n    and gold from Uphaz.\nThey\

    11: "¹¹ Thus shall you say to them: The gods who did not make the heavens and\

    12: "¹² It is he who made the earth by his power,\n    who established the world\

    13: "¹³ When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,\n\

    20: "²⁰ My tent is destroyed,\n    and all my cords are broken;\nmy children have\

    23: "²³ I know, O Lord, that the way of human beings is not in their control,\n\

    24: "²⁴ Correct me, O Lord, but in just measure;\n    not in your anger, or you\

    25: "²⁵ Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you,\n    and on the\

  11:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ You shall say to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed be
      anyone who does not heed the words of this covenant, '
    4: '⁴ which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of
      Egypt, from the iron-smelter, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I
      command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God, '
    5: "⁵ that I may perform the oath that I swore to your ancestors, to give them\
      \ a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then I answered, “So be\
      \ it, Lord.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And the Lord said to me: Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah,
      and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them. '
    7: '⁷ For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them up out of the land
      of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice. '
    8: "⁸ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness\
      \ of an evil will. So I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which\
      \ I commanded them to do, but they did not. \n"
    9: '⁹ And the Lord said to me: Conspiracy exists among the people of Judah and
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors of old, who
      refused to heed my words; they have gone after other gods to serve them; the
      house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant that I made
      with their ancestors. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore, thus says the Lord, assuredly I am going to bring disaster
      upon them that they cannot escape; though they cry out to me, I will not listen
      to them. '
    12: '¹² Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and
      cry out to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they will never save them
      in the time of their trouble. '
    13: "¹³ For your gods have become as many as your towns, O Judah; and as many\
      \ as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars to shame you have set up, altars\
      \ to make offerings to Baal. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on
      their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their
      trouble. '
    15: '¹⁵ What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done vile deeds? Can
      vows and sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult? '
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord once called you, “A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”;
      but with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches
      will be consumed. '
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because\
      \ of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking\
      \ me to anger by making offerings to Baal. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ It was the Lord who made it known to me, and I knew;\n    then you showed\
      \ me their evil deeds.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I was like a gentle lamb\n    led to the slaughter.\nAnd I did not\
      \ know it was against me\n    that they devised schemes, saying,\n“Let us destroy\
      \ the tree with its fruit,\n    let us cut him off from the land of the living,\n\
      \    so that his name will no longer be remembered!”\n"
    20: "²⁰ But you, O Lord of hosts, who judge righteously,\n    who try the heart\
      \ and the mind,\nlet me see your retribution upon them,\n    for to you I have\
      \ committed my cause. \n"
    21: '²¹ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the people of Anathoth, who seek
      your life, and say, “You shall not prophesy in the name of the Lord, or you
      will die by our hand”— '
    22: '²² therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: I am going to punish them; the
      young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by
      famine; '
    23: ²³ and not even a remnant shall be left of them. For I will bring disaster
      upon the people of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.
  12:
    1: "¹ You will be in the right, O Lord,\n    when I lay charges against you;\n\
      \    but let me put my case to you.\nWhy does the way of the guilty prosper?\n\
      \    Why do all who are treacherous thrive?\n"
    2: "² You plant them, and they take root;\n    they grow and bring forth fruit;\n\
      you are near in their mouths\n    yet far from their hearts.\n"
    3: "³ But you, O Lord, know me;\n    You see me and test me—my heart is with you.\n\
      Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,\n    and set them apart for the\
      \ day of slaughter.\n"
    4: "⁴ How long will the land mourn,\n    and the grass of every field wither?\n\
      For the wickedness of those who live in it\n    the animals and the birds are\
      \ swept away,\n    and because people said, “He is blind to our ways.” \n"
    5: "⁵ If you have raced with foot-runners and they have wearied you,\n    how\
      \ will you compete with horses?\nAnd if in a safe land you fall down,\n    how\
      \ will you fare in the thickets of the Jordan?\n"
    6: "⁶ For even your kinsfolk and your own family,\n    even they have dealt treacherously\
      \ with you;\n    they are in full cry after you;\ndo not believe them,\n   \
      \ though they speak friendly words to you. \n"
    7: "⁷ I have forsaken my house,\n    I have abandoned my heritage;\nI have given\
      \ the beloved of my heart\n    into the hands of her enemies.\n"
    8: "⁸ My heritage has become to me\n    like a lion in the forest;\nshe has lifted\
      \ up her voice against me—\n    therefore I hate her.\n"
    9: "⁹ Is the hyena greedy for my heritage at my command?\n    Are the birds of\
      \ prey all around her?\nGo, assemble all the wild animals;\n    bring them to\
      \ devour her.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard,\n    they have trampled down\
      \ my portion,\nthey have made my pleasant portion\n    a desolate wilderness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They have made it a desolation;\n    desolate, it mourns to me.\nThe whole\
      \ land is made desolate,\n    but no one lays it to heart.\n"
    12: "¹² Upon all the bare heights in the desert\n    spoilers have come;\nfor\
      \ the sword of the Lord devours\n    from one end of the land to the other;\n\
      \    no one shall be safe.\n"
    13: "¹³ They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns,\n    they have tired themselves\
      \ out but profit nothing.\nThey shall be ashamed of their harvests\n    because\
      \ of the fierce anger of the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the Lord concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage
      that I have given my people Israel to inherit: I am about to pluck them up from
      their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them,
      and I will bring them again to their heritage and to their land, every one of
      them. '
    16: '¹⁶ And then, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear
      by my name, “As the Lord lives,” as they taught my people to swear by Baal,
      then they shall be built up in the midst of my people. '
    17: ¹⁷ But if any nation will not listen, then I will completely uproot it and
      destroy it, says the Lord.
  13:
    1: '¹ Thus said the Lord to me, “Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth, and put
      it on your loins, but do not dip it in water.” '
    2: '² So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the Lord, and put it on
      my loins. '
    3: '³ And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “Take the loincloth that you bought and are wearing, and go now to the Euphrates,
      and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” '
    5: '⁵ So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. '
    6: '⁶ And after many days the Lord said to me, “Go now to the Euphrates, and take
      from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.” '
    7: "⁷ Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the\
      \ place where I had hidden it. But now the loincloth was ruined; it was good\
      \ for nothing. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    9: '⁹ Thus says the Lord: Just so I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great
      pride of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their
      own will and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall
      be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing. '
    11: "¹¹ For as the loincloth clings to one’s loins, so I made the whole house\
      \ of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the Lord, in order\
      \ that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory. But they\
      \ would not listen. \n"
    12: '¹² You shall speak to them this word: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:
      Every wine-jar should be filled with wine. And they will say to you, “Do you
      think we do not know that every wine-jar should be filled with wine?” '
    13: '¹³ Then you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: I am about to fill all
      the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests,
      the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness. '
    14: "¹⁴ And I will dash them one against another, parents and children together,\
      \ says the Lord. I will not pity or spare or have compassion when I destroy\
      \ them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hear and give ear; do not be haughty,\n    for the Lord has spoken.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Give glory to the Lord your God\n    before he brings darkness,\nand before\
      \ your feet stumble\n    on the mountains at twilight;\nwhile you look for light,\n\
      \    he turns it into gloom\n    and makes it deep darkness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But if you will not listen,\n    my soul will weep in secret for your\
      \ pride;\nmy eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears,\n    because the\
      \ Lord’s flock has been taken captive. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Say to the king and the queen mother:\n    “Take a lowly seat,\nfor your\
      \ beautiful crown\n    has come down from your head.”\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The towns of the Negeb are shut up\n    with no one to open them;\nall\
      \ Judah is taken into exile,\n    wholly taken into exile. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Lift up your eyes and see\n    those who come from the north.\nWhere is\
      \ the flock that was given you,\n    your beautiful flock?\n"
    21: "²¹ What will you say when they set as head over you\n    those whom you have\
      \ trained\n    to be your allies?\nWill not pangs take hold of you,\n    like\
      \ those of a woman in labor?\n"
    22: "²² And if you say in your heart,\n    “Why have these things come upon me?”\n\
      it is for the greatness of your iniquity\n    that your skirts are lifted up,\n\
      \    and you are violated.\n"
    23: "²³ Can Ethiopians change their skin\n    or leopards their spots?\nThen also\
      \ you can do good\n    who are accustomed to do evil.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I will scatter you like chaff\n    driven by the wind from the desert.\n"
    25: "²⁵ This is your lot,\n    the portion I have measured out to you, says the\
      \ Lord,\nbecause you have forgotten me\n    and trusted in lies.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I myself will lift up your skirts over your face,\n    and your shame\
      \ will be seen.\n"
    27: "²⁷ I have seen your abominations,\n    your adulteries and neighings, your\
      \ shameless prostitutions\n    on the hills of the countryside.\nWoe to you,\
      \ O Jerusalem!\n    How long will it be\n    before you are made clean?"
  14:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought: \n"
    2: "² Judah mourns\n    and her gates languish;\nthey lie in gloom on the ground,\n\
      \    and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.\n"
    3: "³ Her nobles send their servants for water;\n    they come to the cisterns,\n\
      they find no water,\n    they return with their vessels empty.\nThey are ashamed\
      \ and dismayed\n    and cover their heads,\n"
    4: "⁴ because the ground is cracked.\n    Because there has been no rain on the\
      \ land\nthe farmers are dismayed;\n    they cover their heads.\n"
    5: "⁵ Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn\n    because there is\
      \ no grass.\n"
    6: "⁶ The wild asses stand on the bare heights,\n    they pant for air like jackals;\n\
      their eyes fail\n    because there is no herbage. \n"
    7: "⁷ Although our iniquities testify against us,\n    act, O Lord, for your name’s\
      \ sake;\nour apostasies indeed are many,\n    and we have sinned against you.\n"
    8: "⁸ O hope of Israel,\n    its savior in time of trouble,\nwhy should you be\
      \ like a stranger in the land,\n    like a traveler turning aside for the night?\n"
    9: "⁹ Why should you be like someone confused,\n    like a mighty warrior who\
      \ cannot give help?\nYet you, O Lord, are in the midst of us,\n    and we are\
      \ called by your name;\n    do not forsake us! \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Thus says the Lord concerning this people:\nTruly they have loved to wander,\n\
      \    they have not restrained their feet;\ntherefore the Lord does not accept\
      \ them,\n    now he will remember their iniquity\n    and punish their sins.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ The Lord said to me: Do not pray for the welfare of this people. '
    12: "¹² Although they fast, I do not hear their cry, and although they offer burnt\
      \ offering and grain offering, I do not accept them; but by the sword, by famine,\
      \ and by pestilence I consume them. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then I said: “Ah, Lord God! Here are the prophets saying to them, ‘You
      shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you true
      peace in this place.’” '
    14: '¹⁴ And the Lord said to me: The prophets are prophesying lies in my name;
      I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying
      to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds. '
    15: '¹⁵ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my
      name though I did not send them, and who say, “Sword and famine shall not come
      on this land”: By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed. '
    16: "¹⁶ And the people to whom they prophesy shall be thrown out into the streets\
      \ of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword. There shall be no one to bury them—themselves,\
      \ their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness\
      \ upon them. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You shall say to them this word:\nLet my eyes run down with tears night\
      \ and day,\n    and let them not cease,\nfor the virgin daughter—my people—is\
      \ struck down with a crushing blow,\n    with a very grievous wound.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If I go out into the field,\n    look—those killed by the sword!\nAnd\
      \ if I enter the city,\n    look—those sick with famine!\nFor both prophet and\
      \ priest ply their trade throughout the land,\n    and have no knowledge. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Have you completely rejected Judah?\n    Does your heart loathe Zion?\n\
      Why have you struck us down\n    so that there is no healing for us?\nWe look\
      \ for peace, but find no good;\n    for a time of healing, but there is terror\
      \ instead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord,\n    the iniquity of our ancestors,\n\
      \    for we have sinned against you.\n"
    21: "²¹ Do not spurn us, for your name’s sake;\n    do not dishonor your glorious\

    22: "²² Can any idols of the nations bring rain?\n    Or can the heavens give\

  15:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me: Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my
      heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let
      them go! '
    2: "² And when they say to you, “Where shall we go?” you shall say to them: Thus\

    3: '³ And I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the Lord: the

    11: '¹¹ then you shall say to them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken

      \ us, as he has often done, and will make him withdraw from us.” \n"
    3: '³ Then Jeremiah said to them: '
    4: '⁴ Thus you shall say to Zedekiah: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I
      am going to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which
      you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are
      besieging you outside the walls; and I will bring them together into the center
      of this city. '
    5: '⁵ I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in
      anger, in fury, and in great wrath. '
    6: '⁶ And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both human beings and
      animals; they shall die of a great pestilence. '
    7: "⁷ Afterward, says the Lord, I will give King Zedekiah of Judah, and his servants,\
      \ and the people in this city—those who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine—into\
      \ the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, into the hands of their enemies,\
      \ into the hands of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with\
      \ the edge of the sword; he shall not pity them, or spare them, or have compassion.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ And to this people you shall say: Thus says the Lord: See, I am setting
      before you the way of life and the way of death. '
    9: '⁹ Those who stay in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence;
      but those who go out and surrender to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall
      live and shall have their lives as a prize of war. '
    10: "¹⁰ For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, says\
      \ the Lord: it shall be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he\
      \ shall burn it with fire. \n"
    11: '¹¹ To the house of the king of Judah say: Hear the word of the Lord, '
    12: "¹² O house of David! Thus says the Lord:\nExecute justice in the morning,\n\
      \    and deliver from the hand of the oppressor\n    anyone who has been robbed,\n\
      or else my wrath will go forth like fire,\n    and burn, with no one to quench\

    13: "¹³ See, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,\n    O rock of the\

      \ who can enter our places of refuge?”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,\nsays the Lord;\n\

  22:
    1: '¹ Thus says the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak
      there this word, '
    2: '² and say: Hear the word of the Lord, O King of Judah sitting on the throne

    3: '³ Thus says the Lord: Act with justice and righteousness, and deliver from
      the hand of the oppressor anyone who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence

    4: '⁴ For if you will indeed obey this word, then through the gates of this house

    5: '⁵ But if you will not heed these words, I swear by myself, says the Lord,

    7: "⁷ I will prepare destroyers against you,\n    all with their weapons;\nthey\
      \ shall cut down your choicest cedars\n    and cast them into the fire. \n"
    8: '⁸ And many nations will pass by this city, and all of them will say one to
      another, “Why has the Lord dealt in this way with that great city?” '
    9: "⁹ And they will answer, “Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord their\
      \ God, and worshiped other gods and served them.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not weep for him who is dead,\n    nor bemoan him;\nweep rather for\

    14: "¹⁴ who says, “I will build myself a spacious house\n    with large upper\
      \ rooms,”\nand who cuts out windows for it,\n    paneling it with cedar,\n \
      \   and painting it with vermilion.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Are you a king\n    because you compete in cedar?\nDid not your father\
      \ eat and drink\n    and do justice and righteousness?\n    Then it was well\
      \ with him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He judged the cause of the poor and needy;\n    then it was well.\nIs\

    18: "¹⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of\

    19: "¹⁹ With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried—\n    dragged off and thrown\

    20: "²⁰ Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,\n    and lift up your voice in Bashan;\n\

    21: "²¹ I spoke to you in your prosperity,\n    but you said, “I will not listen.”\n\
      This has been your way from your youth,\n    for you have not obeyed my voice.\n"
    22: "²² The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,\n    and your lovers shall\

      \ all your wickedness.\n"
    23: "²³ O inhabitant of Lebanon,\n    nested among the cedars,\nhow you will groan\
      \ when pangs come upon you,\n    pain as of a woman in labor! \n"
    24: '²⁴ As I live, says the Lord, even if King Coniah son of Jehoiakim of Judah
      were the signet ring on my right hand, even from there I would tear you off '
    25: '²⁵ and give you into the hands of those who seek your life, into the hands
      of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar
      of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldeans. '
    26: '²⁶ I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where
      you were not born, and there you shall die. '
    27: "²⁷ But they shall not return to the land to which they long to return. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Is this man Coniah a despised broken pot,\n    a vessel no one wants?\n\

    29: "²⁹ O land, land, land,\n    hear the word of the Lord!\n"
    30: "³⁰ Thus says the Lord:\nRecord this man as childless,\n    a man who shall\

  23:
    1: '¹ Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says
      the Lord. '
    2: '² Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds
      who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven
      them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your
      evil doings, says the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where
      I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall
      be fruitful and multiply. '
    4: "⁴ I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall\
      \ not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up for David
      a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute
      justice and righteousness in the land. '
    6: "⁶ In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this\
      \ is the name by which he will be called: “The Lord is our righteousness.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the Lord, when it shall no longer
      be said, “As the Lord lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land
      of Egypt,” '
    8: "⁸ but “As the Lord lives who brought out and led the offspring of the house\
      \ of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had\
      \ driven them.” Then they shall live in their own land. \n"
    9: "⁹ Concerning the prophets:\nMy heart is crushed within me,\n    all my bones\
      \ shake;\nI have become like a drunkard,\n    like one overcome by wine,\nbecause\
      \ of the Lord\n    and because of his holy words.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the land is full of adulterers;\n    because of the curse the land\
      \ mourns,\n    and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.\nTheir course\
      \ has been evil,\n    and their might is not right.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Both prophet and priest are ungodly;\n    even in my house I have found\
      \ their wickedness,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore their way shall be to them\n    like slippery paths in the darkness,\n\
      \    into which they shall be driven and fall;\nfor I will bring disaster upon\
      \ them\n    in the year of their punishment,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ In the prophets of Samaria\n    I saw a disgusting thing:\nthey prophesied\
      \ by Baal\n    and led my people Israel astray.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But in the prophets of Jerusalem\n    I have seen a more shocking thing:\n\
      they commit adultery and walk in lies;\n    they strengthen the hands of evildoers,\n\
      \    so that no one turns from wickedness;\nall of them have become like Sodom\
      \ to me,\n    and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets:\n“I am\
      \ going to make them eat wormwood,\n    and give them poisoned water to drink;\n\
      for from the prophets of Jerusalem\n    ungodliness has spread throughout the\
      \ land.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets
      who prophesy to you; they are deluding you. They speak visions of their own
      minds, not from the mouth of the Lord. '
    17: "¹⁷ They keep saying to those who despise the word of the Lord, “It shall\
      \ be well with you”; and to all who stubbornly follow their own stubborn hearts,\
      \ they say, “No calamity shall come upon you.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For who has stood in the council of the Lord\n    so as to see and to\

    19: "¹⁹ Look, the storm of the Lord!\n    Wrath has gone forth,\na whirling tempest;\n\
      \    it will burst upon the head of the wicked.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The anger of the Lord will not turn back\n    until he has executed and\
      \ accomplished\n    the intents of his mind.\nIn the latter days you will understand\
      \ it clearly. \n"
    21: "²¹ I did not send the prophets,\n    yet they ran;\nI did not speak to them,\n\
      \    yet they prophesied.\n"
    22: "²² But if they had stood in my council,\n    then they would have proclaimed\
      \ my words to my people,\nand they would have turned them from their evil way,\n\

    23: '²³ Am I a God near by, says the Lord, and not a God far off? '
    24: '²⁴ Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them? says the Lord.
      Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name,
      saying, “I have dreamed, I have dreamed!” '
    26: '²⁶ How long? Will the hearts of the prophets ever turn back—those who prophesy
      lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart? '
    27: '²⁷ They plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell
      one another, just as their ancestors forgot my name for Baal. '
    28: '²⁸ Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let the one who has
      my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says
      the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ Is not my word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks
      a rock in pieces? '
    30: '³⁰ See, therefore, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who steal my
      words from one another. '
    31: '³¹ See, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who use their own tongues
      and say, “Says the Lord.” '
    32: "³² See, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the Lord, and\
      \ who tell them, and who lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness,\
      \ when I did not send them or appoint them; so they do not profit this people\
      \ at all, says the Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ When this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, “What is the burden
      of the Lord?” you shall say to them, “You are the burden, and I will cast you
      off, says the Lord.” '
    34: '³⁴ And as for the prophet, priest, or the people who say, “The burden of
      the Lord,” I will punish them and their households. '
    35: '³⁵ Thus shall you say to one another, among yourselves, “What has the Lord
      answered?” or “What has the Lord spoken?” '
    36: '³⁶ But “the burden of the Lord” you shall mention no more, for the burden
      is everyone’s own word, and so you pervert the words of the living God, the
      Lord of hosts, our God. '
    37: '³⁷ Thus you shall ask the prophet, “What has the Lord answered you?” or “What
      has the Lord spoken?” '
    38: '³⁸ But if you say, “the burden of the Lord,” thus says the Lord: Because
      you have said these words, “the burden of the Lord,” when I sent to you, saying,
      You shall not say, “the burden of the Lord,” '
    39: '³⁹ therefore, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence,
      you and the city that I gave to you and your ancestors. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace and perpetual shame, which
      shall not be forgotten.
  24:
    1: '¹ The Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord.
      This was after King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem
      King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, together with the officials of Judah,
      the artisans, and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon. '
    2: '² One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket
      had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. '
    3: "³ And the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the\
      \ good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be\

    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '

      land of the Chaldeans. '
    6: '⁶ I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this
      land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not
      pluck them up. '
    7: "⁷ I will give them a heart to know that I am the Lord; and they shall be my\
      \ people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole\
      \ heart. \n"
    8: '⁸ But thus says the Lord: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be
      eaten, so will I treat King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, the remnant of
      Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ I will make them a horror, an evil thing, to all the kingdoms of the earth—a
      disgrace, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive
      them. '
    10: ¹⁰ And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they are
      utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.
  25:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the
      fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah (that was the first year

    3: '³ For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of King Josiah son of Amon
      of Judah, to this day, the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken
      persistently to you, but you have not listened. '
    4: '⁴ And though the Lord persistently sent you all his servants the prophets,
      you have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear '
    5: '⁵ when they said, “Turn now, every one of you, from your evil way and wicked
      doings, and you will remain upon the land that the Lord has given to you and
      your ancestors from of old and forever; '
    6: '⁶ do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke
      me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.” '
    7: "⁷ Yet you did not listen to me, says the Lord, and so you have provoked me\
      \ to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words, '
    9: '⁹ I am going to send for all the tribes of the north, says the Lord, even

      utterly destroy them, and make them an object of horror and of hissing, and
      an everlasting disgrace. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I will banish from them the sound of mirth and the sound of gladness,
      the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones
      and the light of the lamp. '
    11: '¹¹ This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall
      serve the king of Babylon seventy years. '
    12: '¹² Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon
      and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the Lord,
      making the land an everlasting waste. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against

    14: "¹⁴ For many nations and great kings shall make slaves of them also; and I\

    28: '²⁸ And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you

    36: "³⁶ Hark! the cry of the shepherds,\n    and the wail of the lords of the\
      \ flock!\nFor the Lord is despoiling their pasture,\n"
    37: "³⁷     and the peaceful folds are devastated,\n    because of the fierce\
      \ anger of the Lord.\n"
    38: "³⁸ Like a lion he has left his covert;\n    for their land has become a waste\n\
      because of the cruel sword,\n    and because of his fierce anger."
  26:
    1: '¹ At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah,
      this word came from the Lord: '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord: Stand in the court of the Lord’s house, and speak to
      all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the Lord; speak
      to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word. '
    3: '³ It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil
      way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on
      them because of their evil doings. '
    4: '⁴ You shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: If you will not listen to me,
      to walk in my law that I have set before you, '
    5: '⁵ and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently—though
      you have not heeded— '
    6: "⁶ then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse\
      \ for all the nations of the earth. \n"
    7: '⁷ The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking
      these words in the house of the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded
      him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the
      people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die! '
    9: "⁹ Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘This house shall\
      \ be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And\
      \ all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the
      king’s house to the house of the Lord and took their seat in the entry of the
      New Gate of the house of the Lord. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the\
      \ people, “This man deserves the sentence of death because he has prophesied\
      \ against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, “It
      is the Lord who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the
      words you have heard. '
    13: '¹³ Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the
      Lord your God, and the Lord will change his mind about the disaster that he
      has pronounced against you. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right
      to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing\
      \ innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for\
      \ in truth the Lord sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets,
      “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in
      the name of the Lord our God.” '
    17: '¹⁷ And some of the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembled
      people, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah of Moresheth, who prophesied during the days of King Hezekiah of\
      \ Judah, said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts,\nZion\
      \ shall be plowed as a field;\n    Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,\n\
      \    and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah actually put him to death? Did\
      \ he not fear the Lord and entreat the favor of the Lord, and did not the Lord\
      \ change his mind about the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But\
      \ we are about to bring great disaster on ourselves!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ There was another man prophesying in the name of the Lord, Uriah son of
      Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this
      land in words exactly like those of Jeremiah. '
    21: '²¹ And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials,
      heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard of
      it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Achbor and men with him to Egypt, '
    23: "²³ and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who\
      \ struck him down with the sword and threw his dead body into the burial place\
      \ of the common people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was
      not given over into the hands of the people to be put to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, this
      word came to Jeremiah from the Lord. '
    2: '² Thus the Lord said to me: Make yourself a yoke of straps and bars, and put
      them on your neck. '
    3: '³ Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites,
      the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come
      to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ Give them this charge for their masters: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the
      God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters: '
    5: '⁵ It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth,
      with the people and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever
      I please. '
    6: '⁶ Now I have given all these lands into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of
      Babylon, my servant, and I have given him even the wild animals of the field
      to serve him. '
    7: "⁷ All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the\
      \ time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings shall make him\
      \ their slave. \n"
    8: '⁸ But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this king, Nebuchadnezzar of
      Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, then I will
      punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, says the
      Lord, until I have completed its destruction by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ You, therefore, must not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers,
      your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, “You shall not serve
      the king of Babylon.” '
    10: '¹⁰ For they are prophesying a lie to you, with the result that you will be
      removed far from your land; I will drive you out, and you will perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of\
      \ Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, says the Lord, to till\
      \ it and live there. \n"
    12: '¹² I spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah in the same way: Bring your necks under
      the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. '
    13: '¹³ Why should you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,
      as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of
      Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you not to
      serve the king of Babylon, for they are prophesying a lie to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ I have not sent them, says the Lord, but they are prophesying falsely\
      \ in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish,\
      \ you and the prophets who are prophesying to you. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says
      the Lord: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to
      you, saying, “The vessels of the Lord’s house will soon be brought back from
      Babylon,” for they are prophesying a lie to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should
      this city become a desolation? '
    18: '¹⁸ If indeed they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them,
      then let them intercede with the Lord of hosts, that the vessels left in the
      house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not
      go to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands,
      and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he took into
      exile from Jerusalem to Babylon King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and
      all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— '
    21: '²¹ thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels
      left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall stay, until the
      day when I give attention to them, says the Lord. Then I will bring them up
      and restore them to this place.
  28:
    1: '¹ In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah,
      in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, from
      Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests
      and all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke
      of the king of Babylon. '
    3: '³ Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the
      Lord’s house, which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took away from this place
      and carried to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ I will also bring back to this place King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah,\
      \ and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord, for I will\
      \ break the yoke of the king of Babylon.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence
      of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord; '
    6: '⁶ and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord fulfill
      the words that you have prophesied, and bring back to this place from Babylon
      the vessels of the house of the Lord, and all the exiles. '
    7: '⁷ But listen now to this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing
      of all the people. '
    8: '⁸ The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war,
      famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms. '
    9: "⁹ As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes\
      \ true, then it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah,
      and broke it. '
    11: "¹¹ And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says\
      \ the Lord: This is how I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon\
      \ from the neck of all the nations within two years.” At this, the prophet Jeremiah\
      \ went his way. \n"
    12: '¹² Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from the neck
      of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ Go, tell Hananiah, Thus says the Lord: You have broken wooden bars only
      to forge iron bars in place of them! '
    14: '¹⁴ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put an iron
      yoke on the neck of all these nations so that they may serve King Nebuchadnezzar
      of Babylon, and they shall indeed serve him; I have even given him the wild
      animals. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah,
      the Lord has not sent you, and you made this people trust in a lie. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord: I am going to send you off the face of the\
      \ earth. Within this year you will be dead, because you have spoken rebellion\
      \ against the Lord.” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
  29:
    1: '¹ These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem
      to the remaining elders among the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets,
      and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem
      to Babylon. '
    2: '² This was after King Jeconiah, and the queen mother, the court officials,
      the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans, and the smiths had departed
      from Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son
      of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar
      of Babylon. It said: '
    4: '⁴ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I
      have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: '
    5: '⁵ Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. '
    6: '⁶ Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give
      your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply
      there, and do not decrease. '
    7: '⁷ But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray
      to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. '
    8: '⁸ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let the prophets
      and the diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams
      that they dream, '
    9: "⁹ for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send\
      \ them, says the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For thus says the Lord: Only when Babylon’s seventy years are completed
      will I visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to
      this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your
      welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. '
    12: '¹² Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you. '
    13: '¹³ When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your
      heart, '
    14: "¹⁴ I will let you find me, says the Lord, and I will restore your fortunes\
      \ and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven\
      \ you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent\
      \ you into exile. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Because you have said, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,”— '
    16: '¹⁶ Thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David,
      and concerning all the people who live in this city, your kinsfolk who did not
      go out with you into exile: '
    17: '¹⁷ Thus says the Lord of hosts, I am going to let loose on them sword, famine,
      and pestilence, and I will make them like rotten figs that are so bad they cannot
      be eaten. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and
      will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of
      cursing, and horror, and hissing, and a derision among all the nations where
      I have driven them, '
    19: '¹⁹ because they did not heed my words, says the Lord, when I persistently
      sent to you my servants the prophets, but they would not listen, says the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ But now, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon, hear
      the word of the Lord: '
    21: '²¹ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of
      Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my
      name: I am going to deliver them into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon,
      and he shall kill them before your eyes. '
    22: '²² And on account of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from
      Judah in Babylon: “The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of
      Babylon roasted in the fire,” '
    23: "²³ because they have perpetrated outrage in Israel and have committed adultery\
      \ with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken in my name lying words that I\
      \ did not command them; I am the one who knows and bears witness, says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say: '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: In your own name you sent
      a letter to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to the priest Zephaniah
      son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ The Lord himself has made you priest instead of the priest Jehoiada, so
      that there may be officers in the house of the Lord to control any madman who
      plays the prophet, to put him in the stocks and the collar. '
    27: '²⁷ So now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who plays the prophet
      for you? '
    28: "²⁸ For he has actually sent to us in Babylon, saying, “It will be a long\
      \ time; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat what they produce.”\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ The priest Zephaniah read this letter in the hearing of the prophet Jeremiah. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    31: '³¹ Send to all the exiles, saying, Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah
      of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him,
      and has led you to trust in a lie, '
    32: '³² therefore thus says the Lord: I am going to punish Shemaiah of Nehelam
      and his descendants; he shall not have anyone living among this people to see
      the good that I am going to do to my people, says the Lord, for he has spoken
      rebellion against the Lord.'
  30:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that
      I have spoken to you. '
    3: "³ For the days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will restore the fortunes\
      \ of my people, Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will bring them back\
      \ to the land that I gave to their ancestors and they shall take possession\
      \ of it. \n"
    4: "⁴ These are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah: \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord:\nWe have heard a cry of panic,\n    of terror, and no\
      \ peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask now, and see,\n    can a man bear a child?\nWhy then do I see every\
      \ man\n    with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor?\n    Why has every\
      \ face turned pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ Alas! that day is so great\n    there is none like it;\nit is a time of\
      \ distress for Jacob;\n    yet he shall be rescued from it. \n"
    8: '⁸ On that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will break the yoke from off his
      neck, and I will burst his bonds, and strangers shall no more make a servant
      of him. '
    9: "⁹ But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will\
      \ raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But as for you, have no fear, my servant Jacob, says the Lord,\n    and\
      \ do not be dismayed, O Israel;\nfor I am going to save you from far away,\n\
      \    and your offspring from the land of their captivity.\nJacob shall return\
      \ and have quiet and ease,\n    and no one shall make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you, says the Lord, to save you;\nI will make an end of\
      \ all the nations\n    among which I scattered you,\n    but of you I will not\
      \ make an end.\nI will chastise you in just measure,\n    and I will by no means\
      \ leave you unpunished. \n"
    12: "¹² For thus says the Lord:\nYour hurt is incurable,\n    your wound is grievous.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is no one to uphold your cause,\n    no medicine for your wound,\n\
      \    no healing for you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers have forgotten you;\n    they care nothing for you;\n\
      for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,\n    the punishment of a merciless\
      \ foe,\nbecause your guilt is great,\n    because your sins are so numerous.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry out over your hurt?\n    Your pain is incurable.\nBecause\
      \ your guilt is great,\n    because your sins are so numerous,\n    I have done\
      \ these things to you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,\n    and all your foes,\
      \ every one of them, shall go into captivity;\nthose who plunder you shall be\
      \ plundered,\n    and all who prey on you I will make a prey.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore health to you,\n    and your wounds I will heal,\n\
      says the Lord,\nbecause they have called you an outcast:\n    “It is Zion; no\
      \ one cares for her!” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thus says the Lord:\nI am going to restore the fortunes of the tents of\
      \ Jacob,\n    and have compassion on his dwellings;\nthe city shall be rebuilt\
      \ upon its mound,\n    and the citadel set on its rightful site.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Out of them shall come thanksgiving,\n    and the sound of merrymakers.\n\
      I will make them many, and they shall not be few;\n    I will make them honored,\
      \ and they shall not be disdained.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children shall be as of old,\n    their congregation shall be established\
      \ before me;\n    and I will punish all who oppress them.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their prince shall be one of their own,\n    their ruler shall come from\
      \ their midst;\nI will bring him near, and he shall approach me,\n    for who\
      \ would otherwise dare to approach me?\nsays the Lord.\n"
    22: "²² And you shall be my people,\n    and I will be your God. \n"
    23: "²³ Look, the storm of the Lord!\n    Wrath has gone forth,\na whirling tempest;\n\
      \    it will burst upon the head of the wicked.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back\n    until he has executed\
      \ and accomplished\n    the intents of his mind.\nIn the latter days you will\
      \ understand this."
  31:
    1: "¹ At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel,\
      \ and they shall be my people. \n"
    2: "² Thus says the Lord:\nThe people who survived the sword\n    found grace\
      \ in the wilderness;\nwhen Israel sought for rest,\n"
    3: "³     the Lord appeared to him from far away.\nI have loved you with an everlasting\
      \ love;\n    therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.\n"
    4: "⁴ Again I will build you, and you shall be built,\n    O virgin Israel!\n\
      Again you shall take your tambourines,\n    and go forth in the dance of the\
      \ merrymakers.\n"
    5: "⁵ Again you shall plant vineyards\n    on the mountains of Samaria;\nthe planters\
      \ shall plant,\n    and shall enjoy the fruit.\n"
    6: "⁶ For there shall be a day when sentinels will call\n    in the hill country\
      \ of Ephraim:\n“Come, let us go up to Zion,\n    to the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: "⁷ For thus says the Lord:\nSing aloud with gladness for Jacob,\n    and raise\
      \ shouts for the chief of the nations;\nproclaim, give praise, and say,\n  \
      \  “Save, O Lord, your people,\n    the remnant of Israel.”\n"
    8: "⁸ See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north,\n    and gather\
      \ them from the farthest parts of the earth,\namong them the blind and the lame,\n\
      \    those with child and those in labor, together;\n    a great company, they\
      \ shall return here.\n"
    9: "⁹ With weeping they shall come,\n    and with consolations I will lead them\
      \ back,\nI will let them walk by brooks of water,\n    in a straight path in\
      \ which they shall not stumble;\nfor I have become a father to Israel,\n   \
      \ and Ephraim is my firstborn. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,\n    and declare it in the coastlands\
      \ far away;\nsay, “He who scattered Israel will gather him,\n    and will keep\
      \ him as a shepherd a flock.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has ransomed Jacob,\n    and has redeemed him from hands\
      \ too strong for him.\n"
    12: "¹² They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,\n    and they shall\
      \ be radiant over the goodness of the Lord,\nover the grain, the wine, and the\
      \ oil,\n    and over the young of the flock and the herd;\ntheir life shall\
      \ become like a watered garden,\n    and they shall never languish again.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance,\n    and the young men\
      \ and the old shall be merry.\nI will turn their mourning into joy,\n    I will\
      \ comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will give the priests their fill of fatness,\n    and my people shall\
      \ be satisfied with my bounty,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thus says the Lord:\nA voice is heard in Ramah,\n    lamentation and bitter\
      \ weeping.\nRachel is weeping for her children;\n    she refuses to be comforted\
      \ for her children,\n    because they are no more.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus says the Lord:\nKeep your voice from weeping,\n    and your eyes\
      \ from tears;\nfor there is a reward for your work,\nsays the Lord:\n    they\
      \ shall come back from the land of the enemy;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ there is hope for your future,\nsays the Lord:\n    your children shall\
      \ come back to their own country. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Indeed I heard Ephraim pleading:\n“You disciplined me, and I took the\
      \ discipline;\n    I was like a calf untrained.\nBring me back, let me come\
      \ back,\n    for you are the Lord my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For after I had turned away I repented;\n    and after I was discovered,\
      \ I struck my thigh;\nI was ashamed, and I was dismayed\n    because I bore\
      \ the disgrace of my youth.”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim my dear son?\n    Is he the child I delight in?\nAs often as\
      \ I speak against him,\n    I still remember him.\nTherefore I am deeply moved\
      \ for him;\n    I will surely have mercy on him,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Set up road markers for yourself,\n    make yourself signposts;\nconsider\
      \ well the highway,\n    the road by which you went.\nReturn, O virgin Israel,\n\
      \    return to these your cities.\n"
    22: "²² How long will you waver,\n    O faithless daughter?\nFor the Lord has\
      \ created a new thing on the earth:\n    a woman encompasses a man. \n"
    23: "²³ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Once more they shall use\
      \ these words in the land of Judah and in its towns when I restore their fortunes:\n\
      “The Lord bless you, O abode of righteousness,\n    O holy hill!” \n"
    24: "²⁴ And Judah and all its towns shall live there together, and the farmers\
      \ and those who wander with their flocks. \n"
    25: "²⁵ I will satisfy the weary,\n    and all who are faint I will replenish.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ Thereupon I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me. \n"
    27: '²⁷ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will sow the house of
      Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals. '
    28: '²⁸ And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow,
      destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says
      the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ In those days they shall no longer say:\n“The parents have eaten sour\
      \ grapes,\n    and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour\
      \ grapes shall be set on edge. \n"
    31: '³¹ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant
      with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. '
    32: '³² It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when
      I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant that
      they broke, though I was their husband, says the Lord. '
    33: '³³ But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
      those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it
      on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. '
    34: "³⁴ No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, “Know the\
      \ Lord,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\
      \ says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no\
      \ more. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Thus says the Lord,\nwho gives the sun for light by day\n    and the fixed\
      \ order of the moon and the stars for light by night,\nwho stirs up the sea\
      \ so that its waves roar—\n    the Lord of hosts is his name:\n"
    36: "³⁶ If this fixed order were ever to cease\n    from my presence, says the\
      \ Lord,\nthen also the offspring of Israel would cease\n    to be a nation before\
      \ me forever. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Thus says the Lord:\nIf the heavens above can be measured,\n    and the\
      \ foundations of the earth below can be explored,\nthen I will reject all the\
      \ offspring of Israel\n    because of all they have done,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when the city shall be rebuilt
      for the Lord from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. '
    39: '³⁹ And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb,
      and shall then turn to Goah. '
    40: ⁴⁰ The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as
      far as the Wadi Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall
      be sacred to the Lord. It shall never again be uprooted or overthrown.
  32:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of King Zedekiah
      of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. '
    2: '² At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and
      the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the
      palace of the king of Judah, '
    3: '³ where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him. Zedekiah had said, “Why do
      you prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord: I am going to give this city into
      the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; '
    4: '⁴ King Zedekiah of Judah shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans,
      but shall surely be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and shall speak
      with him face to face and see him eye to eye; '
    5: "⁵ and he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I\
      \ attend to him, says the Lord; though you fight against the Chaldeans, you\
      \ shall not succeed?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me: '
    7: '⁷ Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, “Buy
      my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.” '
    8: "⁸ Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance\
      \ with the word of the Lord, and said to me, “Buy my field that is at Anathoth\
      \ in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours;\
      \ buy it for yourself.” Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ And I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and weighed out
      the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on
      scales. '
    11: '¹¹ Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions,
      and the open copy; '
    12: '¹² and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah,
      in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed
      the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting
      in the court of the guard. '
    13: '¹³ In their presence I charged Baruch, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both
      this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware
      jar, in order that they may last for a long time. '
    15: "¹⁵ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields\
      \ and vineyards shall again be bought in this land. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed
      to the Lord, saying: '
    17: '¹⁷ Ah Lord God! It is you who made the heavens and the earth by your great
      power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You show steadfast love to the thousandth generation, but repay the guilt
      of parents into the laps of their children after them, O great and mighty God
      whose name is the Lord of hosts, '
    19: '¹⁹ great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways
      of mortals, rewarding all according to their ways and according to the fruit
      of their doings. '
    20: '²⁰ You showed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in
      Israel and among all humankind, and have made yourself a name that continues
      to this very day. '
    21: '²¹ You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and
      wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror; '
    22: '²² and you gave them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give
      them, a land flowing with milk and honey; '
    23: '²³ and they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your
      voice or follow your law; of all you commanded them to do, they did nothing.
      Therefore you have made all these disasters come upon them. '
    24: '²⁴ See, the siege ramps have been cast up against the city to take it, and
      the city, faced with sword, famine, and pestilence, has been given into the
      hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has happened,
      as you yourself can see. '
    25: "²⁵ Yet you, O Lord God, have said to me, “Buy the field for money and get\
      \ witnesses”—though the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    27: '²⁷ See, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is anything too hard for me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore, thus says the Lord: I am going to give this city into the hands
      of the Chaldeans and into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he
      shall take it. '
    29: '²⁹ The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come, set it on
      fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to
      Baal and libations have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger. '
    30: '³⁰ For the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done nothing but
      evil in my sight from their youth; the people of Israel have done nothing but
      provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built until
      this day, so that I will remove it from my sight '
    32: '³² because of all the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah
      that they did to provoke me to anger—they, their kings and their officials,
      their priests and their prophets, the citizens of Judah and the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ They have turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I have taught
      them persistently, they would not listen and accept correction. '
    34: '³⁴ They set up their abominations in the house that bears my name, and defiled
      it. '
    35: "³⁵ They built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom,\
      \ to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them,\
      \ nor did it enter my mind that they should do this abomination, causing Judah\
      \ to sin. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Now therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city
      of which you say, “It is being given into the hand of the king of Babylon by
      the sword, by famine, and by pestilence”: '
    37: '³⁷ See, I am going to gather them from all the lands to which I drove them
      in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to
      this place, and I will settle them in safety. '
    38: '³⁸ They shall be my people, and I will be their God. '
    39: '³⁹ I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for all
      time, for their own good and the good of their children after them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ I will make an everlasting covenant with them, never to draw back from
      doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they
      may not turn from me. '
    41: "⁴¹ I will rejoice in doing good to them, and I will plant them in this land\
      \ in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul. \n"
    42: '⁴² For thus says the Lord: Just as I have brought all this great disaster
      upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good fortune that I now
      promise them. '
    43: '⁴³ Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation,
      without human beings or animals; it has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans. '
    44: ⁴⁴ Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed
      and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and
      in the cities of Judah, of the hill country, of the Shephelah, and of the Negeb;
      for I will restore their fortunes, says the Lord.
  33:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still
      confined in the court of the guard: '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord who made the earth, the Lord who formed it to establish
      it—the Lord is his name: '
    3: '³ Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things
      that you have not known. '
    4: '⁴ For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this
      city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense
      against the siege ramps and before the sword: '
    5: '⁵ The Chaldeans are coming in to fight and to fill them with the dead bodies
      of those whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden
      my face from this city because of all their wickedness. '
    6: '⁶ I am going to bring it recovery and healing; I will heal them and reveal
      to them abundance of prosperity and security. '
    7: '⁷ I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild
      them as they were at first. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will
      forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me. '
    9: "⁹ And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before\
      \ all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for\
      \ them; they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity\
      \ I provide for it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Thus says the Lord: In this place of which you say, “It is a waste without
      human beings or animals,” in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem
      that are desolate, without inhabitants, human or animal, there shall once more
      be heard '
    11: "¹¹ the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom\
      \ and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank\
      \ offerings to the house of the Lord:\n“Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,\n\
      \    for the Lord is good,\n    for his steadfast love endures forever!”\nFor\
      \ I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this place that is waste, without human
      beings or animals, and in all its towns there shall again be pasture for shepherds
      resting their flocks. '
    13: "¹³ In the towns of the hill country, of the Shephelah, and of the Negeb,\
      \ in the land of Benjamin, the places around Jerusalem, and in the towns of\
      \ Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them,\
      \ says the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will fulfill the promise
      I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. '
    15: '¹⁵ In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring
      up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. '
    16: "¹⁶ In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And\
      \ this is the name by which it will be called: “The Lord is our righteousness.”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ For thus says the Lord: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne
      of the house of Israel, '
    18: "¹⁸ and the levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer\
      \ burnt offerings, to make grain offerings, and to make sacrifices for all time.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    20: '²⁰ Thus says the Lord: If any of you could break my covenant with the day
      and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their
      appointed time, '
    21: '²¹ only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken, so that he
      would not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with my ministers
      the Levites. '
    22: "²² Just as the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea\
      \ cannot be measured, so I will increase the offspring of my servant David,\
      \ and the Levites who minister to me. \n"
    23: '²³ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    24: '²⁴ Have you not observed how these people say, “The two families that the
      Lord chose have been rejected by him,” and how they hold my people in such contempt
      that they no longer regard them as a nation? '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord: Only if I had not established my covenant with day
      and night and the ordinances of heaven and earth, '
    26: ²⁶ would I reject the offspring of Jacob and of my servant David and not choose
      any of his descendants as rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
      For I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy upon them.
  34:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when King Nebuchadrezzar of
      Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth and all the peoples
      under his dominion were fighting against Jerusalem and all its cities: '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Go and speak to King Zedekiah of
      Judah and say to him: Thus says the Lord: I am going to give this city into
      the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. '
    3: '³ And you yourself shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be captured
      and handed over to him; you shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak
      with him face to face; and you shall go to Babylon. '
    4: '⁴ Yet hear the word of the Lord, O King Zedekiah of Judah! Thus says the Lord
      concerning you: You shall not die by the sword; '
    5: "⁵ you shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your ancestors, the\
      \ earlier kings who preceded you, so they shall burn spices for you and lament\
      \ for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” For I have spoken the word, says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah,
      in Jerusalem, '
    7: "⁷ when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and\
      \ against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah; for these\
      \ were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained. \n"
    8: '⁸ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made
      a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty
      to them— '
    9: '⁹ that all should set free their Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no
      one should hold another Judean in slavery. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered
      into the covenant that all would set free their slaves, male or female, so that
      they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free. '
    11: '¹¹ But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves
      they had set free, and brought them again into subjection as slaves. '
    12: '¹² The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    13: '¹³ Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your
      ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
      slavery, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ “Every seventh year each of you must set free any Hebrews who have been
      sold to you and have served you six years; you must set them free from your
      service.” But your ancestors did not listen to me or incline their ears to me. '
    15: '¹⁵ You yourselves recently repented and did what was right in my sight by
      proclaiming liberty to one another, and you made a covenant before me in the
      house that is called by my name; '
    16: '¹⁶ but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took
      back your male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire,
      and you brought them again into subjection to be your slaves. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore, thus says the Lord: You have not obeyed me by granting a release
      to your neighbors and friends; I am going to grant a release to you, says the
      Lord—a release to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine. I will make you a
      horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ And those who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the
      covenant that they made before me, I will make like the calf when they cut it
      in two and passed between its parts: '
    19: '¹⁹ the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests,
      and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf '
    20: '²⁰ shall be handed over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives.
      Their corpses shall become food for the birds of the air and the wild animals
      of the earth. '
    21: '²¹ And as for King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials, I will hand them
      over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives, to the army of the
      king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you. '
    22: ²² I am going to command, says the Lord, and will bring them back to this
      city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. The
      towns of Judah I will make a desolation without inhabitant.
  35:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim
      son of Josiah of Judah: '
    2: '² Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to
      the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. '
    3: '³ So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers,
      and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. '
    4: '⁴ I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of
      Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials,
      above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold. '
    5: '⁵ Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I
      said to them, “Have some wine.” '
    6: '⁶ But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son
      of Rechab commanded us, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; '
    7: '⁷ nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard,
      or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live
      many days in the land where you reside.’ '
    8: '⁸ We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that
      he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons,
      or our daughters, '
    9: '⁹ and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; '
    10: '¹⁰ but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor
      Jonadab commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said,\
      \ ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and\
      \ the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people
      of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey
      my words? says the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ The command has been carried out that Jonadab son of Rechab gave to his
      descendants to drink no wine; and they drink none to this day, for they have
      obeyed their ancestor’s command. But I myself have spoken to you persistently,
      and you have not obeyed me. '
    15: '¹⁵ I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently,
      saying, “Turn now every one of you from your evil way, and amend your doings,
      and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall live in the
      land that I gave to you and your ancestors.” But you did not incline your ear
      or obey me. '
    16: '¹⁶ The descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the command
      that their ancestor gave them, but this people has not obeyed me. '
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: I\
      \ am going to bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster\
      \ that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them and they\
      \ have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus says the Lord of
      hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor
      Jonadab, and kept all his precepts, and done all that he commanded you, '
    19: '¹⁹ therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab son
      of Rechab shall not lack a descendant to stand before me for all time.'
  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came
      to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against
      Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the
      days of Josiah until today. '
    3: "³ It may be that when the house of Judah hears of all the disasters that I\
      \ intend to do to them, all of them may turn from their evil ways, so that I\
      \ may forgive their iniquity and their sin. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll
      at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the Lord that he had spoken to him. '
    5: '⁵ And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am prevented from entering the house
      of the Lord; '
    6: '⁶ so you go yourself, and on a fast day in the hearing of the people in the
      Lord’s house you shall read the words of the Lord from the scroll that you have
      written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the
      people of Judah who come up from their towns. '
    7: '⁷ It may be that their plea will come before the Lord, and that all of them
      will turn from their evil ways, for great is the anger and wrath that the Lord
      has pronounced against this people.” '
    8: "⁸ And Baruch son of Neriah did all that the prophet Jeremiah ordered him about\
      \ reading from the scroll the words of the Lord in the Lord’s house. \n"
    9: '⁹ In the fifth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, in the ninth
      month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns
      of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah\
      \ from the scroll, in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah son\
      \ of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the\
      \ New Gate of the Lord’s house. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all the words of the
      Lord from the scroll, '
    12: '¹² he went down to the king’s house, into the secretary’s chamber; and all
      the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah,
      Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and
      all the officials. '
    13: '¹³ And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read
      the scroll in the hearing of the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son
      of Cushi to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of
      the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and
      came to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they said to him, “Sit down and read it to us.” So Baruch read it
      to them. '
    16: '¹⁶ When they heard all the words, they turned to one another in alarm, and
      said to Baruch, “We certainly must report all these words to the king.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then they questioned Baruch, “Tell us now, how did you write all these
      words? Was it at his dictation?” '
    18: '¹⁸ Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote
      them with ink on the scroll.” '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and\
      \ let no one know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Leaving the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, they went
      to the court of the king; and they reported all the words to the king. '
    21: '²¹ Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber
      of Elishama the secretary; and Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials
      who stood beside the king. '
    22: '²² Now the king was sitting in his winter apartment (it was the ninth month),
      and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him. '
    23: '²³ As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with
      a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll
      was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. '
    24: '²⁴ Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words,
      was alarmed, nor did they tear their garments. '
    25: '²⁵ Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn
      the scroll, he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son and Seraiah son of Azriel\
      \ and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the secretary Baruch and the prophet\
      \ Jeremiah. But the Lord hid them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now, after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote
      at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    28: '²⁸ Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in
      the first scroll, which King Jehoiakim of Judah has burned. '
    29: '²⁹ And concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah you shall say: Thus says the Lord,
      You have dared to burn this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it that
      the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut
      off from it human beings and animals? '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah: He shall
      have no one to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast
      out to the heat by day and the frost by night. '
    31: "³¹ And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity;\
      \ I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people\
      \ of Judah, all the disasters with which I have threatened them—but they would\
      \ not listen. \n"
    32: ³² Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the secretary Baruch son
      of Neriah, who wrote on it at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the scroll
      that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words
      were added to them.
  37:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah son of Josiah, whom King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made king in
      the land of Judah, succeeded Coniah son of Jehoiakim. '
    2: "² But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the\
      \ words of the Lord that he spoke through the prophet Jeremiah. \n"
    3: '³ King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son
      of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah saying, “Please pray for us to the Lord
      our God.” '
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not
      yet been put in prison. '
    5: "⁵ Meanwhile, the army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans\
      \ who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah: '
    7: '⁷ Thus says the Lord, God of Israel: This is what the two of you shall say
      to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Pharaoh’s army, which
      set out to help you, is going to return to its own land, to Egypt. '
    8: '⁸ And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city; they shall take
      it and burn it with fire. '
    9: '⁹ Thus says the Lord: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will
      surely go away from us,” for they will not go away. '
    10: "¹⁰ Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against\
      \ you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would\
      \ rise up and burn this city with fire. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach
      of Pharaoh’s army, '
    12: '¹² Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive
      his share of property among the people there. '
    13: '¹³ When he reached the Benjamin Gate, a sentinel there named Irijah son of
      Shelemiah son of Hananiah arrested the prophet Jeremiah saying, “You are deserting
      to the Chaldeans.” '
    14: '¹⁴ And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.”
      But Irijah would not listen to him, and arrested Jeremiah and brought him to
      the officials. '
    15: '¹⁵ The officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned
      him in the house of the secretary Jonathan, for it had been made a prison. '
    16: "¹⁶ Thus Jeremiah was put in the cistern house, in the cells, and remained\
      \ there many days. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned
      him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the Lord?” Jeremiah
      said, “There is!” Then he said, “You shall be handed over to the king of Babylon.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or
      your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon
      will not come against you and against this land’? '
    20: '²⁰ Now please hear me, my lord king: be good enough to listen to my plea,
      and do not send me back to the house of the secretary Jonathan to die there.” '
    21: ²¹ So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court
      of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street,
      until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court
      of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah,
      and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all
      the people, '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord, Those who stay in this city shall die by the sword,
      by famine, and by pestilence; but those who go out to the Chaldeans shall live;
      they shall have their lives as a prize of war, and live. '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord, This city shall surely be handed over to the army of
      the king of Babylon and be taken. '
    4: '⁴ Then the officials said to the king, “This man ought to be put to death,
      because he is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, and all the
      people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare
      of this people, but their harm.” '
    5: '⁵ King Zedekiah said, “Here he is; he is in your hands; for the king is powerless
      against you.” '
    6: "⁶ So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s\
      \ son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes.\
      \ Now there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in\
      \ the mud. \n"
    7: '⁷ Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king’s house, heard that they
      had put Jeremiah into the cistern. The king happened to be sitting at the Benjamin
      Gate, '
    8: '⁸ So Ebed-melech left the king’s house and spoke to the king, '
    9: '⁹ “My lord king, these men have acted wickedly in all they did to the prophet
      Jeremiah by throwing him into the cistern to die there of hunger, for there
      is no bread left in the city.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, “Take three men with
      you from here, and pull the prophet Jeremiah up from the cistern before he dies.” '
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king,
      to a wardrobe of the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes,
      which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes. '
    12: '¹² Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Just put the rags and
      clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. '
    13: "¹³ Then they drew Jeremiah up by the ropes and pulled him out of the cistern.\
      \ And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah and received him at the third
      entrance of the temple of the Lord. The king said to Jeremiah, “I have something
      to ask you; do not hide anything from me.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, you will put me to death, will
      you not? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So King Zedekiah swore an oath in secret to Jeremiah, “As the Lord lives,\
      \ who gave us our lives, I will not put you to death or hand you over to these\
      \ men who seek your life.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts,
      the God of Israel, If you will only surrender to the officials of the king of
      Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with
      fire, and you and your house shall live. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then
      this city shall be handed over to the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with
      fire, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand.” '
    19: '¹⁹ King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted
      to the Chaldeans, for I might be handed over to them and they would abuse me.” '
    20: '²⁰ Jeremiah said, “That will not happen. Just obey the voice of the Lord
      in what I say to you, and it shall go well with you, and your life shall be
      spared. '
    21: '²¹ But if you are determined not to surrender, this is what the Lord has
      shown me— '
    22: "²² a vision of all the women remaining in the house of the king of Judah\
      \ being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and saying,\n‘Your trusted\
      \ friends have seduced you\n    and have overcome you;\nNow that your feet are\
      \ stuck in the mud,\n    they desert you.’ \n"
    23: "²³ All your wives and your children shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and\
      \ you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the\
      \ king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone else know of this conversation,
      or you will die. '
    25: '²⁵ If the officials should hear that I have spoken with you, and they should
      come and say to you, ‘Just tell us what you said to the king; do not conceal
      it from us, or we will put you to death. What did the king say to you?’ '
    26: '²⁶ then you shall say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea to the king not
      to send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’” '
    27: '²⁷ All the officials did come to Jeremiah and questioned him; and he answered
      them in the very words the king had commanded. So they stopped questioning him,
      for the conversation had not been overheard. '
    28: ²⁸ And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem
      was taken.
  39:
    1: '¹ In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadrezzar
      of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it; '
    2: '² in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day
      of the month, a breach was made in the city. '
    3: '³ When Jerusalem was taken, all the officials of the king of Babylon came
      and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rabsaris,
      Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the officials of the king of
      Babylon. '
    4: '⁴ When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going
      out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between
      the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah. '
    5: '⁵ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the
      plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to King
      Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence
      on him. '
    6: '⁶ The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his
      eyes; also the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: '⁷ He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters to take him to
      Babylon. '
    8: '⁸ The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people, and
      broke down the walls of Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard exiled to Babylon the rest of
      the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the
      people who remained. '
    10: "¹⁰ Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of\
      \ the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the\
      \ same time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through
      Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Take him, look after him well and do him no harm, but deal with him as
      he may ask you.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer
      the Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon sent '
    14: "¹⁴ and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah\
      \ son of Ahikam son of Shaphan to be brought home. So he stayed with his own\
      \ people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court
      of the guard: '
    16: '¹⁶ Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian: Thus says the Lord of hosts,
      the God of Israel: I am going to fulfill my words against this city for evil
      and not for good, and they shall be accomplished in your presence on that day. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will save you on that day, says the Lord, and you shall not be handed
      over to those whom you dread. '
    18: ¹⁸ For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but you
      shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have trusted in me, says
      the Lord.
  40:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain
      of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in fetters along
      with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. '
    2: '² The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God
      threatened this place with this disaster; '
    3: '³ and now the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said, because
      all of you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice. Therefore this
      thing has come upon you. '
    4: '⁴ Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands.
      If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you;
      but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the
      whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. '
    5: '⁵ If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom
      the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with
      him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain
      of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. '
    6: "⁶ Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with\
      \ him among the people who were left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ When all the leaders of the forces in the open country and their troops
      heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor
      in the land, and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the
      poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, '
    8: '⁸ they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of
      Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah
      son of the Maacathite, they and their troops. '
    9: '⁹ Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan swore to them and their troops, saying,
      “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king
      of Babylon, and it shall go well with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for me, I am staying at Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans
      who come to us; but as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store
      them in your vessels, and live in the towns that you have taken over.” '
    11: '¹¹ Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites
      and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant
      in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor
      over them, '
    12: "¹² then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been\
      \ scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah; and they gathered\
      \ wine and summer fruits in great abundance. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open
      country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah '
    14: '¹⁴ and said to him, “Are you at all aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites
      has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam
      would not believe them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please
      let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one else will know. Why
      should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered around you
      would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?” '
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do such
      a thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, of the royal
      family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah
      son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah, '
    2: '² Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him got up and struck down
      Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, because
      the king of Babylon had appointed him governor in the land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and\
      \ the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there. \n"
    4: '⁴ On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it, '
    5: '⁵ eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards
      shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings
      and incense to present at the temple of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping
      as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” '
    7: '⁷ When they reached the middle of the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the
      men with him slaughtered them, and threw them into a cistern. '
    8: "⁸ But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us,\
      \ for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.”\
      \ So he refrained, and did not kill them along with their companions. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men
      whom he had struck down was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense
      against King Baasha of Israel; Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled that cistern
      with those whom he had killed. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah,\
      \ the king’s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan,\
      \ the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael\
      \ son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with
      him heard of all the crimes that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done, '
    12: '¹² they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah.
      They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah
      and all the leaders of the forces with him, they were glad. '
    14: '¹⁴ So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned
      around and came back, and went to Johanan son of Kareah. '
    15: '¹⁵ But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and
      went to the Ammonites. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him
      took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael son of Nethaniah had carried away
      captive from Mizpah after he had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam—soldiers, women,
      children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they set out, and stopped at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending
      to go to Egypt '
    18: ¹⁸ because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
      son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon
      had made governor over the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah
      son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached '
    2: '² the prophet Jeremiah and said, “Be good enough to listen to our plea, and
      pray to the Lord your God for us—for all this remnant. For there are only a
      few of us left out of many, as your eyes can see. '
    3: '³ Let the Lord your God show us where we should go and what we should do.” '
    4: '⁴ The prophet Jeremiah said to them, “Very well: I am going to pray to the
      Lord your God as you request, and whatever the Lord answers you I will tell
      you; I will keep nothing back from you.” '
    5: '⁵ They in their turn said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful
      witness against us if we do not act according to everything that the Lord your
      God sends us through you. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to\
      \ whom we are sending you, in order that it may go well with us when we obey\
      \ the voice of the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ At the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ Then he summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces
      who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, '
    9: '⁹ and said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent
      me to present your plea before him: '
    10: '¹⁰ If you will only remain in this land, then I will build you up and not
      pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I am sorry for the
      disaster that I have brought upon you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, as you have been; do not be afraid
      of him, says the Lord, for I am with you, to save you and to rescue you from
      his hand. '
    12: '¹² I will grant you mercy, and he will have mercy on you and restore you
      to your native soil. '
    13: '¹³ But if you continue to say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ thus disobeying
      the voice of the Lord your God '
    14: '¹⁴ and saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see
      war, or hear the sound of the trumpet, or be hungry for bread, and there we
      will stay,’ '
    15: '¹⁵ then hear the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, the God of Israel: If you are determined to enter Egypt and go to
      settle there, '
    16: '¹⁶ then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there, in the land of
      Egypt; and the famine that you dread shall follow close after you into Egypt;
      and there you shall die. '
    17: "¹⁷ All the people who have determined to go to Egypt to settle there shall\
      \ die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant\
      \ or survivor from the disaster that I am bringing upon them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Just as my anger
      and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will
      be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an object of execration
      and horror, of cursing and ridicule. You shall see this place no more. '
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord has said to you, O remnant of Judah, Do not go to Egypt. Be well
      aware that I have warned you today '
    20: '²⁰ that you have made a fatal mistake. For you yourselves sent me to the
      Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God, and whatever the Lord
      our God says, tell us and we will do it.’ '
    21: '²¹ So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord
      your God in anything that he sent me to tell you. '
    22: ²² Be well aware, then, that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by
      pestilence in the place where you desire to go and settle.”
  43:
    1: '¹ When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the
      Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, '
    2: '² Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent
      men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send
      you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to settle there’; '
    3: '³ but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to
      the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.” '
    4: '⁴ So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the
      people did not obey the voice of the Lord, to stay in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ But Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all
      the remnant of Judah who had returned to settle in the land of Judah from all
      the nations to which they had been driven— '
    6: '⁶ the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan
      the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan;
      also the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah. '
    7: "⁷ And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of\
      \ the Lord. And they arrived at Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes: '
    9: '⁹ Take some large stones in your hands, and bury them in the clay pavement
      that is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. Let the Judeans see
      you do it, '
    10: '¹⁰ and say to them, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I am
      going to send and take my servant King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he will
      set his throne above these stones that I have buried, and he will spread his
      royal canopy over them. '
    11: "¹¹ He shall come and ravage the land of Egypt, giving\nthose who are destined\
      \ for pestilence, to pestilence,\n    and those who are destined for captivity,\
      \ to captivity,\n    and those who are destined for the sword, to the sword.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² He shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt; and he shall
      burn them and carry them away captive; and he shall pick clean the land of Egypt,
      as a shepherd picks his cloak clean of vermin; and he shall depart from there
      safely. '
    13: ¹³ He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt;
      and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.
  44:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Judeans living in the land of
      Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, '
    2: '² Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You yourselves have seen
      all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah.
      Look at them; today they are a desolation, without an inhabitant in them, '
    3: '³ because of the wickedness that they committed, provoking me to anger, in
      that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they had not known,
      neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors. '
    4: '⁴ Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, “I
      beg you not to do this abominable thing that I hate!” '
    5: '⁵ But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their wickedness
      and make no offerings to other gods. '
    6: '⁶ So my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the towns of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a waste and a desolation, as
      they still are today. '
    7: '⁷ And now thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why are you
      doing such great harm to yourselves, to cut off man and woman, child and infant,
      from the midst of Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant? '
    8: '⁸ Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings
      to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to settle? Will you be
      cut off and become an object of cursing and ridicule among all the nations of
      the earth? '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the crimes of your ancestors, of the kings of Judah,
      of their wives, your own crimes and those of your wives, which they committed
      in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ They have shown no contrition or fear to this day, nor have they walked\
      \ in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your ancestors.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I am determined
      to bring disaster on you, to bring all Judah to an end. '
    12: '¹² I will take the remnant of Judah who are determined to come to the land
      of Egypt to settle, and they shall perish, everyone; in the land of Egypt they
      shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall perish; from the least to
      the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine; and they shall become
      an object of execration and horror, of cursing and ridicule. '
    13: '¹³ I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished
      Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, '
    14: "¹⁴ so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to settle in the land\
      \ of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah. Although\
      \ they long to go back to live there, they shall not go back, except some fugitives.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who were aware that their wives had been making offerings
      to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people
      who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah: '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we
      are not going to listen to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Instead, we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the
      queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, just as we and our ancestors,
      our kings and our officials, used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets
      of Jerusalem. We used to have plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no misfortune. '
    18: '¹⁸ But from the time we stopped making offerings to the queen of heaven and
      pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have perished by
      the sword and by famine.” '
    19: "¹⁹ And the women said, “Indeed we will go on making offerings to the queen\
      \ of heaven and pouring out libations to her; do you think that we made cakes\
      \ for her, marked with her image, and poured out libations to her without our\
      \ husbands’ being involved?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who
      were giving him this answer: '
    21: '²¹ “As for the offerings that you made in the towns of Judah and in the streets
      of Jerusalem, you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials, and the
      people of the land, did not the Lord remember them? Did it not come into his
      mind? '
    22: '²² The Lord could no longer bear the sight of your evil doings, the abominations
      that you committed; therefore your land became a desolation and a waste and
      a curse, without inhabitant, as it is to this day. '
    23: "²³ It is because you burned offerings, and because you sinned against the\
      \ Lord and did not obey the voice of the Lord or walk in his law and in his\
      \ statutes and in his decrees, that this disaster has befallen you, as is still\
      \ evident today.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the
      Lord, all you Judeans who are in the land of Egypt, '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have
      accomplished in deeds what you declared in words, saying, ‘We are determined
      to perform the vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven
      and to pour out libations to her.’ By all means, keep your vows and make your
      libations! '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all you Judeans who live in the land
      of Egypt: Lo, I swear by my great name, says the Lord, that my name shall no
      longer be pronounced on the lips of any of the people of Judah in all the land
      of Egypt, saying, ‘As the Lord God lives.’ '
    27: '²⁷ I am going to watch over them for harm and not for good; all the people
      of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall perish by the sword and by famine,
      until not one is left. '
    28: '²⁸ And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to
      the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have come
      to the land of Egypt to settle, shall know whose words will stand, mine or theirs! '
    29: '²⁹ This shall be the sign to you, says the Lord, that I am going to punish
      you in this place, in order that you may know that my words against you will
      surely be carried out: '
    30: ³⁰ Thus says the Lord, I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into
      the hands of his enemies, those who seek his life, just as I gave King Zedekiah
      of Judah into the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, his enemy who sought
      his life.”

    2: '² Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: '
    3: '³ You said, “Woe is me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with
      my groaning, and I find no rest.” '
    4: '⁴ Thus you shall say to him, “Thus says the Lord: I am going to break down
      what I have built, and pluck up what I have planted—that is, the whole land. '
    5: ⁵ And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am
      going to bring disaster upon all flesh, says the Lord; but I will give you your
      life as a prize of war in every place to which you may go.”

      who can stand before me? '
    45: '⁴⁵ Therefore hear the plan that the Lord has made against Babylon, and the

    59: '⁵⁹ The word that the prophet Jeremiah commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son

      year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster. '
    60: '⁶⁰ Jeremiah wrote in a scroll all the disasters that would come on Babylon,

    61: '⁶¹ And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you

    63: '⁶³ When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it, and throw it into

  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven
      years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. '
    2: '² He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. '
    3: "³ Indeed, Jerusalem and Judah so angered the Lord that he expelled them from\

    4: '⁴ And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day
      of the month, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came with all his army against
      Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it; they built siegeworks against it all around. '
    5: '⁵ So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. '
    6: '⁶ On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine became so severe in the
      city that there was no food for the people of the land. '
    7: '⁷ Then a breach was made in the city wall; and all the soldiers fled and went
      out from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by
      the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They went
      in the direction of the Arabah. '
    8: '⁸ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in
      the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered, deserting him. '
    9: '⁹ Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at

    10: '¹⁰ The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also

    13: '¹³ He burned the house of the Lord, the king’s house, and all the houses

    15: '¹⁵ Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest

    17: '¹⁷ The pillars of bronze that were in the house of the Lord, and the stands
      and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in

    18: '¹⁸ They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the ladles,
      and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service. '
    19: '¹⁹ The captain of the guard took away the small bowls also, the firepans,

    20: '²⁰ As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were
      under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of
      the Lord, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weighing. '
    21: '²¹ As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits,
      its circumference was twelve cubits; it was hollow and its thickness was four
      fingers. '
    22: '²² Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the capital was five cubits;
      latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, encircled the top of the capital.
      And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates. '
    23: "²³ There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates\
      \ encircling the latticework numbered one hundred. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah, the second priest
      Zephaniah, and the three guardians of the threshold; '

      of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty
      men of the people of the land who were found inside the city. '
    26: '²⁶ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them
      to the king of Babylon at Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ And the king of Babylon struck them down, and put them to death at Riblah\
      \ in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile out of its land. \n"
    28: '²⁸ This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrezzar took into exile:
      in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans; '
    29: '²⁹ in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he took into exile from Jerusalem
      eight hundred thirty-two persons; '
    30: "³⁰ in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of\

    31: '³¹ In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in
      the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, King Evil-merodach
      of Babylon, in the year he began to reign, showed favor to King Jehoiachin of
      Judah and brought him out of prison; '
    32: '³² he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the other
      kings who were with him in Babylon. '
    33: '³³ So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes, and every day of his life
      he dined regularly at the king’s table. '
    34: ³⁴ For his allowance, a regular daily allowance was given him by the king
      of Babylon, as long as he lived, up to the day of his death.
