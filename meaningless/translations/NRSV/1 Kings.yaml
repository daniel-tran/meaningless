1 Kings:
  1:
    1: '¹ King David was old and advanced in years; and although they covered him
      with clothes, he could not get warm. '
    2: '² So his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the
      king, and let her wait on the king, and be his attendant; let her lie in your
      bosom, so that my lord the king may be warm.” '
    3: '³ So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel,
      and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. '
    4: "⁴ The girl was very beautiful. She became the king’s attendant and served\
      \ him, but the king did not know her sexually. \n"
    5: '⁵ Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; he
      prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. '
    6: '⁶ His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, “Why have you
      done thus and so?” He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after
      Absalom. '
    7: '⁷ He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, and
      they supported Adonijah. '
    8: "⁸ But the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the prophet Nathan,\
      \ and Shimei, and Rei, and David’s own warriors did not side with Adonijah.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the stone Zoheleth,
      which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,
      and all the royal officials of Judah, '
    10: "¹⁰ but he did not invite the prophet Nathan or Benaiah or the warriors or\
      \ his brother Solomon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that
      Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know it? '
    12: '¹² Now therefore come, let me give you advice, so that you may save your
      own life and the life of your son Solomon. '
    13: '¹³ Go in at once to King David, and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord the
      king, swear to your servant, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king,
      and he shall sit on my throne? Why then is Adonijah king?’ '
    14: "¹⁴ Then while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in\
      \ after you and confirm your words.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So Bathsheba went to the king in his room. The king was very old; Abishag
      the Shunammite was attending the king. '
    16: '¹⁶ Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, “What
      do you wish?” '
    17: '¹⁷ She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your
      God, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on
      my throne. '
    18: '¹⁸ But now suddenly Adonijah has become king, though you, my lord the king,
      do not know it. '
    19: '¹⁹ He has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has
      invited all the children of the king, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander
      of the army; but your servant Solomon he has not invited. '
    20: '²⁰ But you, my lord the king—the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them
      who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. '
    21: "²¹ Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his\
      \ ancestors, that my son Solomon and I will be counted offenders.” \n"
    22: '²² While she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan came in. '
    23: '²³ The king was told, “Here is the prophet Nathan.” When he came in before
      the king, he did obeisance to the king, with his face to the ground. '
    24: '²⁴ Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall succeed
      me as king, and he shall sit on my throne’? '
    25: '²⁵ For today he has gone down and has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and
      sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s children, Joab the commander
      of the army, and the priest Abiathar, who are now eating and drinking before
      him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ '
    26: '²⁶ But he did not invite me, your servant, and the priest Zadok, and Benaiah
      son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon. '
    27: "²⁷ Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not\
      \ let your servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after\
      \ him?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ King David answered, “Summon Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s
      presence, and stood before the king. '
    29: '²⁹ The king swore, saying, “As the Lord lives, who has saved my life from
      every adversity, '
    30: '³⁰ as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Your son Solomon shall
      succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so will I do
      this day.” '
    31: "³¹ Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to\
      \ the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!” \n"
    32: '³² King David said, “Summon to me the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and
      Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king, '
    33: '³³ the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have
      my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. '
    34: '³⁴ There let the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king over
      Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ '
    35: '³⁵ You shall go up following him. Let him enter and sit on my throne; he
      shall be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel
      and over Judah.” '
    36: '³⁶ Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the Lord, the God
      of my lord the king, so ordain. '
    37: "³⁷ As the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon,\
      \ and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.” \n"
    38: '³⁸ So the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
      and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and had Solomon ride on King
      David’s mule, and led him to Gihon. '
    39: '³⁹ There the priest Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed
      Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King
      Solomon!” '
    40: "⁴⁰ And all the people went up following him, playing on pipes and rejoicing\
      \ with great joy, so that the earth quaked at their noise. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished
      feasting. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is the city
      in an uproar?” '
    42: '⁴² While he was still speaking, Jonathan son of the priest Abiathar arrived.
      Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a worthy man and surely you bring good
      news.” '
    43: '⁴³ Jonathan answered Adonijah, “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon
      king; '
    44: '⁴⁴ the king has sent with him the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah
      son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they had him ride
      on the king’s mule; '
    45: '⁴⁵ the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon;
      and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar.
      This is the noise that you heard. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Solomon now sits on the royal throne. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Moreover the king’s servants came to congratulate our lord King David,
      saying, ‘May God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his
      throne greater than your throne.’ The king bowed in worship on the bed '
    48: "⁴⁸ and went on to pray thus, ‘Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who\
      \ today has granted one of my offspring to sit on my throne and permitted me\
      \ to witness it.’” \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ Then all the guests of Adonijah got up trembling and went their own ways. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Adonijah, fearing Solomon, got up and went to grasp the horns of the altar. '
    51: '⁵¹ Solomon was informed, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; see, he has
      laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first
      that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’” '
    52: '⁵² So Solomon responded, “If he proves to be a worthy man, not one of his
      hairs shall fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall
      die.” '
    53: ⁵³ Then King Solomon sent to have him brought down from the altar. He came
      to do obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go home.”
  2:
    1: '¹ When David’s time to die drew near, he charged his son Solomon, saying: '
    2: '² “I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, be courageous, '
    3: '³ and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping
      his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is
      written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and
      wherever you turn. '
    4: "⁴ Then the Lord will establish his word that he spoke concerning me: ‘If your\
      \ heirs take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their\
      \ heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a successor on the\
      \ throne of Israel.’ \n"
    5: '⁵ “Moreover you know also what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt
      with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner son of Ner, and Amasa
      son of Jether, whom he murdered, retaliating in time of peace for blood that
      had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist,
      and on the sandals on his feet. '
    6: '⁶ Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go
      down to Sheol in peace. '
    7: '⁷ Deal loyally, however, with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
      them be among those who eat at your table; for with such loyalty they met me
      when I fled from your brother Absalom. '
    8: '⁸ There is also with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim,
      who cursed me with a terrible curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim; but
      when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, ‘I will
      not put you to death with the sword.’ '
    9: "⁹ Therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; you will know\
      \ what you ought to do to him, and you must bring his gray head down with blood\
      \ to Sheol.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then David slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the city of David. '
    11: '¹¹ The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven
      years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. '
    12: "¹² So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was\
      \ firmly established. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She
      asked, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then he said, “May I have a word with you?” She said, “Go on.” '
    15: '¹⁵ He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel expected
      me to reign; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s,
      for it was his from the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.” She said
      to him, “Go on.” '
    17: '¹⁷ He said, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag
      the Shunammite as my wife.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king on your behalf.”\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah.
      The king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne,
      and had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. '
    20: '²⁰ Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse
      me.” And the king said to her, “Make your request, my mother; for I will not
      refuse you.” '
    21: '²¹ She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah
      as his wife.” '
    22: '²² King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite
      for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom as well! For he is my elder brother; ask
      not only for him but also for the priest Abiathar and for Joab son of Zeruiah!” '
    23: '²³ Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, “So may God do to me, and more also,
      for Adonijah has devised this scheme at the risk of his life! '
    24: '²⁴ Now therefore as the Lord lives, who has established me and placed me
      on the throne of my father David, and who has made me a house as he promised,
      today Adonijah shall be put to death.” '
    25: "²⁵ So King Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he struck him down, and\
      \ he died. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The king said to the priest Abiathar, “Go to Anathoth, to your estate;
      for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because
      you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David, and because you
      shared in all the hardships my father endured.” '
    27: "²⁷ So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, thus fulfilling\
      \ the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah though he had
      not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and grasped the horns
      of the altar. '
    29: '²⁹ When it was told King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord
      and now is beside the altar,” Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying,
      “Go, strike him down.” '
    30: '³⁰ So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him, “The king commands,
      ‘Come out.’” But he said, “No, I will die here.” Then Benaiah brought the king
      word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.” '
    31: '³¹ The king replied to him, “Do as he has said, strike him down and bury
      him; and thus take away from me and from my father’s house the guilt for the
      blood that Joab shed without cause. '
    32: '³² The Lord will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without
      the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two
      men more righteous and better than himself, Abner son of Ner, commander of the
      army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. '
    33: '³³ So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of
      his descendants forever; but to David, and to his descendants, and to his house,
      and to his throne, there shall be peace from the Lord forevermore.” '
    34: '³⁴ Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him;
      and he was buried at his own house near the wilderness. '
    35: "³⁵ The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the\
      \ king put the priest Zadok in the place of Abiathar. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself
      a house in Jerusalem, and live there, and do not go out from there to any place
      whatever. '
    37: '³⁷ For on the day you go out, and cross the Wadi Kidron, know for certain
      that you shall die; your blood shall be on your own head.” '
    38: "³⁸ And Shimei said to the king, “The sentence is fair; as my lord the king\
      \ has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei’s slaves
      ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. When it was told Shimei, “Your
      slaves are in Gath,” '
    40: '⁴⁰ Shimei arose and saddled a donkey, and went to Achish in Gath, to search
      for his slaves; Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. '
    41: '⁴¹ When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and
      returned, '
    42: '⁴² the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, “Did I not make you
      swear by the Lord, and solemnly adjure you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on
      the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die’? And you said
      to me, ‘The sentence is fair; I accept.’ '
    43: '⁴³ Why then have you not kept your oath to the Lord and the commandment with
      which I charged you?” '
    44: '⁴⁴ The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your own heart all the evil
      that you did to my father David; so the Lord will bring back your evil on your
      own head. '
    45: '⁴⁵ But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established
      before the Lord forever.” '
    46: "⁴⁶ Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck\
      \ him down, and he died.\nSo the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
  3:
    1: '¹ Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt; he took Pharaoh’s
      daughter and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building
      his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem. '
    2: "² The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house\
      \ had yet been built for the name of the Lord. \n"
    3: '³ Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father David; only,
      he sacrificed and offered incense at the high places. '
    4: '⁴ The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the principal high
      place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. '
    5: '⁵ At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said,
      “Ask what I should give you.” '
    6: '⁶ And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant
      my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness,
      and in uprightness of heart toward you; and you have kept for him this great
      and steadfast love, and have given him a son to sit on his throne today. '
    7: '⁷ And now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father
      David, although I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come
      in. '
    8: '⁸ And your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great
      people, so numerous they cannot be numbered or counted. '
    9: "⁹ Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people,\
      \ able to discern between good and evil; for who can govern this your great\
      \ people?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. '
    11: '¹¹ God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for
      yourself long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked
      for yourself understanding to discern what is right, '
    12: '¹² I now do according to your word. Indeed I give you a wise and discerning
      mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you shall arise after
      you. '
    13: '¹³ I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor all your
      life; no other king shall compare with you. '
    14: "¹⁴ If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments,\
      \ as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your life.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Solomon awoke; it had been a dream. He came to Jerusalem where he\
      \ stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. He offered up burnt offerings\
      \ and offerings of well-being, and provided a feast for all his servants. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Later, two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before
      him. '
    17: '¹⁷ The one woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same
      house; and I gave birth while she was in the house. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth.
      We were together; there was no one else with us in the house, only the two of
      us were in the house. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him. '
    20: '²⁰ She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while
      your servant slept. She laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my
      breast. '
    21: '²¹ When I rose in the morning to nurse my son, I saw that he was dead; but
      when I looked at him closely in the morning, clearly it was not the son I had
      borne.” '
    22: "²² But the other woman said, “No, the living son is mine, and the dead son\
      \ is yours.” The first said, “No, the dead son is yours, and the living son\
      \ is mine.” So they argued before the king. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son that is alive, and
      your son is dead’; while the other says, ‘Not so! Your son is dead, and my son
      is the living one.’” '
    24: '²⁴ So the king said, “Bring me a sword,” and they brought a sword before
      the king. '
    25: '²⁵ The king said, “Divide the living boy in two; then give half to the one,
      and half to the other.” '
    26: '²⁶ But the woman whose son was alive said to the king—because compassion
      for her son burned within her—“Please, my lord, give her the living boy; certainly
      do not kill him!” The other said, “It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide
      it.” '
    27: '²⁷ Then the king responded: “Give the first woman the living boy; do not
      kill him. She is his mother.” '
    28: ²⁸ All Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered; and they stood
      in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him,
      to execute justice.
  4:
    1: '¹ King Solomon was king over all Israel, '
    2: '² and these were his high officials: Azariah son of Zadok was the priest; '
    3: '³ Elihoreph and Ahijah sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of
      Ahilud was recorder; '
    4: '⁴ Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were
      priests; '
    5: '⁵ Azariah son of Nathan was over the officials; Zabud son of Nathan was priest
      and king’s friend; '
    6: "⁶ Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda was in charge\
      \ of the forced labor. \n"
    7: '⁷ Solomon had twelve officials over all Israel, who provided food for the
      king and his household; each one had to make provision for one month in the
      year. '
    8: '⁸ These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; '
    9: '⁹ Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; '
    10: '¹⁰ Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher); '
    11: '¹¹ Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter,
      as his wife); '
    12: '¹² Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is
      beside Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as
      the other side of Jokmeam; '
    13: '¹³ Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair son of Manasseh,
      which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty
      great cities with walls and bronze bars); '
    14: '¹⁴ Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; '
    15: '¹⁵ Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he had taken Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as his
      wife); '
    16: '¹⁶ Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; '
    17: '¹⁷ Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar; '
    18: '¹⁸ Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin; '
    19: "¹⁹ Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of King Sihon of\
      \ the Amorites and of King Og of Bashan. And there was one official in the land\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea; they ate and
      drank and were happy. '
    21: "²¹ Solomon was sovereign over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the\
      \ land of the Philistines, even to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute\
      \ and served Solomon all the days of his life. \n"
    22: '²² Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors of choice flour, and sixty
      cors of meal, '
    23: '²³ ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, one hundred sheep, besides
      deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl. '
    24: '²⁴ For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah
      to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates; and he had peace on all sides. '
    25: '²⁵ During Solomon’s lifetime Judah and Israel lived in safety, from Dan even
      to Beer-sheba, all of them under their vines and fig trees. '
    26: '²⁶ Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and
      twelve thousand horsemen. '
    27: '²⁷ Those officials supplied provisions for King Solomon and for all who came
      to King Solomon’s table, each one in his month; they let nothing be lacking. '
    28: "²⁸ They also brought to the required place barley and straw for the horses\
      \ and swift steeds, each according to his charge. \n"
    29: '²⁹ God gave Solomon very great wisdom, discernment, and breadth of understanding
      as vast as the sand on the seashore, '
    30: '³⁰ so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the
      east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. '
    31: '³¹ He was wiser than anyone else, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman,
      Calcol, and Darda, children of Mahol; his fame spread throughout all the surrounding
      nations. '
    32: '³² He composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand
      and five. '
    33: '³³ He would speak of trees, from the cedar that is in the Lebanon to the
      hyssop that grows in the wall; he would speak of animals, and birds, and reptiles,
      and fish. '
    34: ³⁴ People came from all the nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon; they came
      from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
  5:
    1: '¹ Now King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that
      they had anointed him king in place of his father; for Hiram had always been
      a friend to David. '
    2: '² Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying, '
    3: '³ “You know that my father David could not build a house for the name of the
      Lord his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until
      the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. '
    4: '⁴ But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither
      adversary nor misfortune. '
    5: '⁵ So I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord
      said to my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place,
      shall build the house for my name.’ '
    6: "⁶ Therefore command that cedars from the Lebanon be cut for me. My servants\
      \ will join your servants, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your\
      \ servants; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut\
      \ timber like the Sidonians.” \n"
    7: '⁷ When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed
      be the Lord today, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.” '
    8: '⁸ Hiram sent word to Solomon, “I have heard the message that you have sent
      to me; I will fulfill all your needs in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. '
    9: '⁹ My servants shall bring it down to the sea from the Lebanon; I will make
      it into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will have them broken
      up there for you to take away. And you shall meet my needs by providing food
      for my household.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So Hiram supplied Solomon’s every need for timber of cedar and cypress. '
    11: '¹¹ Solomon in turn gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his
      household, and twenty cors of fine oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. '
    12: "¹² So the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. There was peace between\
      \ Hiram and Solomon; and the two of them made a treaty. \n"
    13: '¹³ King Solomon conscripted forced labor out of all Israel; the levy numbered
      thirty thousand men. '
    14: '¹⁴ He sent them to the Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts; they would
      be a month in the Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of
      the forced labor. '
    15: '¹⁵ Solomon also had seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters
      in the hill country, '
    16: '¹⁶ besides Solomon’s three thousand three hundred supervisors who were over
      the work, having charge of the people who did the work. '
    17: '¹⁷ At the king’s command, they quarried out great, costly stones in order
      to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. '
    18: ¹⁸ So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did the stonecutting
      and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
  6:
    1: '¹ In the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out of the
      land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month
      of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the Lord. '
    2: '² The house that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty
      cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. '
    3: '³ The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits wide,
      across the width of the house. Its depth was ten cubits in front of the house. '
    4: '⁴ For the house he made windows with recessed frames. '
    5: '⁵ He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around
      the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side
      chambers all around. '
    6: "⁶ The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one was six cubits wide,\
      \ and the third was seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the house he\
      \ made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be\
      \ inserted into the walls of the house. \n"
    7: "⁷ The house was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that neither hammer\
      \ nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The entrance for the middle story was on the south side of the house: one
      went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to
      the third. '
    9: '⁹ So he built the house, and finished it; he roofed the house with beams and
      planks of cedar. '
    10: "¹⁰ He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits\
      \ high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, '
    12: '¹² “Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes,
      obey my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, then I
      will establish my promise with you, which I made to your father David. '
    13: "¹³ I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people\
      \ Israel.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So Solomon built the house, and finished it. '
    15: '¹⁵ He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from
      the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the
      inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. '
    16: '¹⁶ He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from
      the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as
      the most holy place. '
    17: '¹⁷ The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty
      cubits long. '
    18: '¹⁸ The cedar within the house had carvings of gourds and open flowers; all
      was cedar, no stone was seen. '
    19: '¹⁹ The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to
      set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ The interior of the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits
      wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid
      the altar with cedar. '
    21: '²¹ Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, then he drew
      chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with
      gold. '
    22: "²² Next he overlaid the whole house with gold, in order that the whole house\
      \ might be perfect; even the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary\
      \ he overlaid with gold. \n"
    23: '²³ In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits
      high. '
    24: '²⁴ Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
      the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of
      one wing to the tip of the other. '
    25: '²⁵ The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same
      measure and the same form. '
    26: '²⁶ The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other
      cherub. '
    27: '²⁷ He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; the wings of the
      cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one was touching the one wall, and
      a wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; their other wings toward
      the center of the house were touching wing to wing. '
    28: "²⁸ He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. \n"
    29: '²⁹ He carved the walls of the house all around about with carved engravings
      of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. '
    30: "³⁰ The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the
      lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. '
    32: "³² He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm\
      \ trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the\
      \ cherubim and on the palm trees. \n"
    33: '³³ So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, four-sided
      each, '
    34: '³⁴ and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding,
      and the two leaves of the other door were folding. '
    35: '³⁵ He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaying them with
      gold evenly applied upon the carved work. '
    36: "³⁶ He built the inner court with three courses of dressed stone to one course\
      \ of cedar beams. \n"
    37: '³⁷ In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in
      the month of Ziv. '
    38: ³⁸ In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the
      house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications.
      He was seven years in building it.
  7:
    1: "¹ Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire\
      \ house. \n"
    2: '² He built the House of the Forest of the Lebanon one hundred cubits long,
      fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, built on four rows of cedar pillars,
      with cedar beams on the pillars. '
    3: '³ It was roofed with cedar on the forty-five rafters, fifteen in each row,
      which were on the pillars. '
    4: '⁴ There were window frames in the three rows, facing each other in the three
      rows. '
    5: "⁵ All the doorways and doorposts had four-sided frames, opposite, facing each\
      \ other in the three rows. \n"
    6: "⁶ He made the Hall of Pillars fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. There\
      \ was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them. \n"
    7: "⁷ He made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, the Hall\
      \ of Justice, covered with cedar from floor to floor. \n"
    8: "⁸ His own house where he would reside, in the other court back of the hall,\
      \ was of the same construction. Solomon also made a house like this hall for\
      \ Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken in marriage. \n"
    9: '⁹ All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with
      saws, back and front, from the foundation to the coping, and from outside to
      the great court. '
    10: '¹⁰ The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and
      ten cubits. '
    11: '¹¹ There were costly stones above, cut to measure, and cedarwood. '
    12: "¹² The great court had three courses of dressed stone to one layer of cedar\
      \ beams all around; so had the inner court of the house of the Lord, and the\
      \ vestibule of the house. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre. '
    14: "¹⁴ He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, whose father, a man\
      \ of Tyre, had been an artisan in bronze; he was full of skill, intelligence,\
      \ and knowledge in working bronze. He came to King Solomon, and did all his\
      \ work. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of the one,
      and a cord of twelve cubits would encircle it; the second pillar was the same. '
    16: '¹⁶ He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set on the tops of the
      pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the
      other capital was five cubits. '
    17: '¹⁷ There were nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals
      on the tops of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other
      capital. '
    18: '¹⁸ He made the columns with two rows around each latticework to cover the
      capitals that were above the pomegranates; he did the same with the other capital. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule
      were of lily-work, four cubits high. '
    20: '²⁰ The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection
      that was beside the latticework; there were two hundred pomegranates in rows
      all around; and so with the other capital. '
    21: '²¹ He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar
      on the south and called it Jachin; and he set up the pillar on the north and
      called it Boaz. '
    22: "²² On the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars\
      \ was finished. \n"
    23: '²³ Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim,
      and five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely. '
    24: '²⁴ Under its brim were panels all around it, each of ten cubits, surrounding
      the sea; there were two rows of panels, cast when it was cast. '
    25: '²⁵ It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three
      facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set on them. The hindquarters
      of each were toward the inside. '
    26: "²⁶ Its thickness was a handbreadth; its brim was made like the brim of a\
      \ cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths. \n"
    27: '²⁷ He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long,
      four cubits wide, and three cubits high. '
    28: '²⁸ This was the construction of the stands: they had borders; the borders
      were within the frames; '
    29: '²⁹ on the borders that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim.
      On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of
      beveled work. '
    30: '³⁰ Each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; at the four corners
      were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of
      each. '
    31: '³¹ Its opening was within the crown whose height was one cubit; its opening
      was round, as a pedestal is made; it was a cubit and a half wide. At its opening
      there were carvings; its borders were four-sided, not round. '
    32: '³² The four wheels were underneath the borders; the axles of the wheels were
      in the stands; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. '
    33: '³³ The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their
      spokes, and their hubs were all cast. '
    34: '³⁴ There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports
      were of one piece with the stands. '
    35: '³⁵ On the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; on the
      top of the stand, its stays and its borders were of one piece with it. '
    36: '³⁶ On the surfaces of its stays and on its borders he carved cherubim, lions,
      and palm trees, where each had space, with wreaths all around. '
    37: "³⁷ In this way he made the ten stands; all of them were cast alike, with\
      \ the same size and the same form. \n"
    38: '³⁸ He made ten basins of bronze; each basin held forty baths, each basin
      measured four cubits; there was a basin for each of the ten stands. '
    39: "³⁹ He set five of the stands on the south side of the house, and five on\
      \ the north side of the house; he set the sea on the southeast corner of the\
      \ house. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished
      all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the Lord: '
    41: '⁴¹ the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of
      the pillars, the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that
      were on the tops of the pillars; '
    42: '⁴² the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates
      for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
      pillars; '
    43: '⁴³ the ten stands, the ten basins on the stands; '
    44: "⁴⁴ the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ The pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels that Hiram made
      for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of burnished bronze. '
    46: '⁴⁶ In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between
      Succoth and Zarethan. '
    47: "⁴⁷ Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of\
      \ them; the weight of the bronze was not determined. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the Lord: the
      golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence, '
    49: '⁴⁹ the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north,
      in front of the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; '
    50: "⁵⁰ the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure\
      \ gold; the sockets for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the most\
      \ holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple, of gold. \n"
    51: ⁵¹ Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the Lord was finished.
      Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, the silver,
      the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of
      the Lord.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes,
      the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in
      Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of
      David, which is Zion. '
    2: '² All the people of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the festival in the
      month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. '
    3: '³ And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark. '
    4: '⁴ So they brought up the ark of the Lord, the tent of meeting, and all the
      holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them
      up. '
    5: '⁵ King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before
      him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they
      could not be counted or numbered. '
    6: '⁶ Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place,
      in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the
      wings of the cherubim. '
    7: '⁷ For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that
      the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles. '
    8: '⁸ The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy
      place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside;
      they are there to this day. '
    9: '⁹ There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses
      had placed there at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites,
      when they came out of the land of Egypt. '
    10: '¹⁰ And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house
      of the Lord, '
    11: "¹¹ so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud;\
      \ for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² Then Solomon said,\n“The Lord has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.\n"
    13: "¹³ I have built you an exalted house,\n    a place for you to dwell in forever.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while
      all the assembly of Israel stood. '
    15: '¹⁵ He said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hand has
      fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not
      chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that
      my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’ '
    17: '¹⁷ My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the Lord,
      the God of Israel. '
    18: '¹⁸ But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to consider building
      a house for my name; '
    19: '¹⁹ nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be
      born to you shall build the house for my name.’ '
    20: '²⁰ Now the Lord has upheld the promise that he made; for I have risen in
      the place of my father David; I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised,
      and have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    21: "²¹ There I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of\
      \ the Lord that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land\
      \ of Egypt.” \n"
    22: '²² Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all
      the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven. '
    23: '²³ He said, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above
      or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who
      walk before you with all their heart, '
    24: '²⁴ the covenant that you kept for your servant my father David as you declared
      to him; you promised with your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand. '
    25: '²⁵ Therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David
      that which you promised him, saying, ‘There shall never fail you a successor
      before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their
      way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’ '
    26: "²⁶ Therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised\
      \ to your servant my father David. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven
      cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built! '
    28: '²⁸ Regard your servant’s prayer and his plea, O Lord my God, heeding the
      cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today; '
    29: '²⁹ that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place
      of which you said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may heed the prayer that
      your servant prays toward this place. '
    30: "³⁰ Hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray\
      \ toward this place; O hear in heaven your dwelling place; heed and forgive.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ “If someone sins against a neighbor and is given an oath to swear, and
      comes and swears before your altar in this house, '
    32: "³² then hear in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the\
      \ guilty by bringing their conduct on their own head, and vindicating the righteous\
      \ by rewarding them according to their righteousness. \n"
    33: '³³ “When your people Israel, having sinned against you, are defeated before
      an enemy but turn again to you, confess your name, pray and plead with you in
      this house, '
    34: "³⁴ then hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring\
      \ them again to the land that you gave to their ancestors. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned
      against you, and then they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn
      from their sin, because you punish them, '
    36: "³⁶ then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, your people\
      \ Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and grant\
      \ rain on your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ “If there is famine in the land, if there is plague, blight, mildew, locust,
      or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in any of their cities; whatever
      plague, whatever sickness there is; '
    38: '³⁸ whatever prayer, whatever plea there is from any individual or from all
      your people Israel, all knowing the afflictions of their own hearts so that
      they stretch out their hands toward this house; '
    39: '³⁹ then hear in heaven your dwelling place, forgive, act, and render to all
      whose hearts you know—according to all their ways, for only you know what is
      in every human heart— '
    40: "⁴⁰ so that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that\
      \ you gave to our ancestors. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from
      a distant land because of your name '
    42: '⁴² —for they shall hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched
      arm—when a foreigner comes and prays toward this house, '
    43: "⁴³ then hear in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that\
      \ the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know\
      \ your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and so that they may know\
      \ that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way
      you shall send them, and they pray to the Lord toward the city that you have
      chosen and the house that I have built for your name, '
    45: "⁴⁵ then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.\
      \ \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you
      are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away
      captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; '
    47: '⁴⁷ yet if they come to their senses in the land to which they have been taken
      captive, and repent, and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying,
      ‘We have sinned, and have done wrong; we have acted wickedly’; '
    48: '⁴⁸ if they repent with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies,
      who took them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to
      their ancestors, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built
      for your name; '
    49: '⁴⁹ then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, maintain
      their cause '
    50: '⁵⁰ and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions
      that they have committed against you; and grant them compassion in the sight
      of their captors, so that they may have compassion on them '
    51: '⁵¹ (for they are your people and heritage, which you brought out of Egypt,
      from the midst of the iron-smelter). '
    52: '⁵² Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant, and to the plea of
      your people Israel, listening to them whenever they call to you. '
    53: "⁵³ For you have separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to\
      \ be your heritage, just as you promised through Moses, your servant, when you\
      \ brought our ancestors out of Egypt, O Lord God.” \n"
    54: '⁵⁴ Now when Solomon finished offering all this prayer and this plea to the
      Lord, he arose from facing the altar of the Lord, where he had knelt with hands
      outstretched toward heaven; '
    55: "⁵⁵ he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice: \n"
    56: '⁵⁶ “Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to his people Israel according
      to all that he promised; not one word has failed of all his good promise, which
      he spoke through his servant Moses. '
    57: '⁵⁷ The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our ancestors; may he not
      leave us or abandon us, '
    58: '⁵⁸ but incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
      commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our ancestors. '
    59: '⁵⁹ Let these words of mine, with which I pleaded before the Lord, be near
      to the Lord our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant
      and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires; '
    60: '⁶⁰ so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God; there
      is no other. '
    61: "⁶¹ Therefore devote yourselves completely to the Lord our God, walking in\
      \ his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day.” \n"
    62: '⁶² Then the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the Lord. '
    63: '⁶³ Solomon offered as sacrifices of well-being to the Lord twenty-two thousand
      oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people of
      Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. '
    64: "⁶⁴ The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in\
      \ front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the burnt offerings and\
      \ the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the sacrifices of well-being, because\
      \ the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt\
      \ offerings and the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the sacrifices of\
      \ well-being. \n"
    65: '⁶⁵ So Solomon held the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a great
      assembly, people from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt—before the Lord our God,
      seven days. '
    66: ⁶⁶ On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and
      went to their tents, joyful and in good spirits because of all the goodness
      that the Lord had shown to his servant David and to his people Israel.
  9:
    1: '¹ When Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and the king’s
      house and all that Solomon desired to build, '
    2: '² the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at
      Gibeon. '
    3: '³ The Lord said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you
      made before me; I have consecrated this house that you have built, and put my
      name there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time. '
    4: '⁴ As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with
      integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded
      you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, '
    5: "⁵ then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised\
      \ your father David, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a successor on the throne\
      \ of Israel.’ \n"
    6: '⁶ “If you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep
      my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve
      other gods and worship them, '
    7: '⁷ then I will cut Israel off from the land that I have given them; and the
      house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel
      will become a proverb and a taunt among all peoples. '
    8: '⁸ This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished,
      and will hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this
      land and to this house?’ '
    9: "⁹ Then they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken the Lord their God, who\
      \ brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods,\
      \ worshiping them and serving them; therefore the Lord has brought this disaster\
      \ upon them.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses,
      the house of the Lord and the king’s house, '
    11: '¹¹ King Hiram of Tyre having supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber
      and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in
      the land of Galilee. '
    12: '¹² But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given
      him, they did not please him. '
    13: '¹³ Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these that you have given
      me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul to this day. '
    14: "¹⁴ But Hiram had sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted
      to build the house of the Lord and his own house, the Millo and the wall of
      Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer '
    16: '¹⁶ (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it down,
      had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to
      his daughter, Solomon’s wife; '
    17: '¹⁷ so Solomon rebuilt Gezer), Lower Beth-horon, '
    18: '¹⁸ Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness, within the land, '
    19: '¹⁹ as well as all of Solomon’s storage cities, the cities for his chariots,
      the cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build, in Jerusalem,
      in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. '
    20: '²⁰ All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
      the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel— '
    21: '²¹ their descendants who were still left in the land, whom the Israelites
      were unable to destroy completely—these Solomon conscripted for slave labor,
      and so they are to this day. '
    22: "²² But of the Israelites Solomon made no slaves; they were the soldiers,\
      \ they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, and the commanders\
      \ of his chariotry and cavalry. \n"
    23: "²³ These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work: five hundred\
      \ fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. \n"
    24: "²⁴ But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house\
      \ that Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and sacrifices\
      \ of well-being on the altar that he built for the Lord, offering incense before\
      \ the Lord. So he completed the house. \n"
    26: '²⁶ King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth
      on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. '
    27: '²⁷ Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who were familiar with
      the sea, together with the servants of Solomon. '
    28: ²⁸ They went to Ophir, and imported from there four hundred twenty talents
      of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
  10:
    1: '¹ When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon (fame due to the name
      of the Lord), she came to test him with hard questions. '
    2: '² She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices,
      and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she told
      him all that was on her mind. '
    3: '³ Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king
      that he could not explain to her. '
    4: '⁴ When the queen of Sheba had observed all the wisdom of Solomon, the house
      that he had built, '
    5: "⁵ the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance\
      \ of his servants, their clothing, his valets, and his burnt offerings that\
      \ he offered at the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. \n"
    6: '⁶ So she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land
      of your accomplishments and of your wisdom, '
    7: '⁷ but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen
      it. Not even half had been told me; your wisdom and prosperity far surpass the
      report that I had heard. '
    8: '⁸ Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend
      you and hear your wisdom! '
    9: '⁹ Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the
      throne of Israel! Because the Lord loved Israel forever, he has made you king
      to execute justice and righteousness.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, a great quantity\
      \ of spices, and precious stones; never again did spices come in such quantity\
      \ as that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from
      Ophir a great quantity of almug wood and precious stones. '
    12: "¹² From the almug wood the king made supports for the house of the Lord,\
      \ and for the king’s house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug\
      \ wood has come or been seen to this day. \n"
    13: "¹³ Meanwhile King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desire that she\
      \ expressed, as well as what he gave her out of Solomon’s royal bounty. Then\
      \ she returned to her own land, with her servants. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six
      talents of gold, '
    15: '¹⁵ besides that which came from the traders and from the business of the
      merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land. '
    16: '¹⁶ King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred
      shekels of gold went into each large shield. '
    17: '¹⁷ He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went
      into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. '
    18: '¹⁸ The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest
      gold. '
    19: '¹⁹ The throne had six steps. The top of the throne was rounded in the back,
      and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the
      arm rests, '
    20: '²⁰ while twelve lions were standing, one on each end of a step on the six
      steps. Nothing like it was ever made in any kingdom. '
    21: '²¹ All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
      of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver—it
      was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. '
    22: "²² For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of\
      \ Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come\
      \ bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. \n"
    23: '²³ Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in
      wisdom. '
    24: '²⁴ The whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which
      God had put into his mind. '
    25: "²⁵ Every one of them brought a present, objects of silver and gold, garments,\
      \ weaponry, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Solomon gathered together chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred
      chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities
      and with the king in Jerusalem. '
    27: '²⁷ The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars
      as numerous as the sycamores of the Shephelah. '
    28: '²⁸ Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s traders
      received them from Kue at a price. '
    29: ²⁹ A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver,
      and a horse for one hundred fifty; so through the king’s traders they were exported
      to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
  11:
    1: '¹ King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh:
      Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, '
    2: '² from the nations concerning which the Lord had said to the Israelites, “You
      shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you; for they
      will surely incline your heart to follow their gods”; Solomon clung to these
      in love. '
    3: '³ Among his wives were seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines;
      and his wives turned away his heart. '
    4: '⁴ For when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods;
      and his heart was not true to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father
      David. '
    5: '⁵ For Solomon followed Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom the
      abomination of the Ammonites. '
    6: '⁶ So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did not completely
      follow the Lord, as his father David had done. '
    7: '⁷ Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and
      for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ He did the same for all his foreign wives, who offered incense and sacrificed\
      \ to their gods. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away
      from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, '
    10: '¹⁰ and had commanded him concerning this matter, that he should not follow
      other gods; but he did not observe what the Lord commanded. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this has been your mind and
      you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will
      surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant. '
    12: '¹² Yet for the sake of your father David I will not do it in your lifetime;
      I will tear it out of the hand of your son. '
    13: "¹³ I will not, however, tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe\
      \ to your son, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem,\
      \ which I have chosen.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite;
      he was of the royal house in Edom. '
    15: '¹⁵ For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up
      to bury the dead, he killed every male in Edom '
    16: '¹⁶ (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had eliminated
      every male in Edom); '
    17: '¹⁷ but Hadad fled to Egypt with some Edomites who were servants of his father.
      He was a young boy at that time. '
    18: '¹⁸ They set out from Midian and came to Paran; they took people with them
      from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house,
      assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land. '
    19: '¹⁹ Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him his
      sister-in-law for a wife, the sister of Queen Tahpenes. '
    20: '²⁰ The sister of Tahpenes gave birth by him to his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes
      weaned in Pharaoh’s house; Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the children
      of Pharaoh. '
    21: '²¹ When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his ancestors and that
      Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart,
      that I may go to my own country.” '
    22: "²² But Pharaoh said to him, “What do you lack with me that you now seek to\
      \ go to your own country?” And he said, “No, do let me go.” \n"
    23: '²³ God raised up another adversary against Solomon, Rezon son of Eliada,
      who had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah. '
    24: '²⁴ He gathered followers around him and became leader of a marauding band,
      after the slaughter by David; they went to Damascus, settled there, and made
      him king in Damascus. '
    25: "²⁵ He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, making trouble\
      \ as Hadad did; he despised Israel and reigned over Aram. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon,
      whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, rebelled against the king. '
    27: '²⁷ The following was the reason he rebelled against the king. Solomon built
      the Millo, and closed up the gap in the wall of the city of his father David. '
    28: '²⁸ The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man
      was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of
      Joseph. '
    29: '²⁹ About that time, when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah
      the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah had clothed himself with a new garment.
      The two of them were alone in the open country '
    30: '³⁰ when Ahijah laid hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into
      twelve pieces. '
    31: '³¹ He then said to Jeroboam: Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says
      the Lord, the God of Israel, “See, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand
      of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes. '
    32: '³² One tribe will remain his, for the sake of my servant David and for the
      sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. '
    33: '³³ This is because he has forsaken me, worshiped Astarte the goddess of the
      Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and
      has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes
      and my ordinances, as his father David did. '
    34: '³⁴ Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom away from him but will
      make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of my servant David whom
      I chose and who did keep my commandments and my statutes; '
    35: '³⁵ but I will take the kingdom away from his son and give it to you—that
      is, the ten tribes. '
    36: '³⁶ Yet to his son I will give one tribe, so that my servant David may always
      have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. '
    37: '³⁷ I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires;
      you shall be king over Israel. '
    38: '³⁸ If you will listen to all that I command you, walk in my ways, and do
      what is right in my sight by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David
      my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you an enduring house, as
      I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. '
    39: '³⁹ For this reason I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.” '
    40: "⁴⁰ Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam promptly fled\
      \ to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until the death\
      \ of Solomon. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did as well as his wisdom,
      are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? '
    42: '⁴² The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. '
    43: ⁴³ Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father
      David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.
  12:
    1: '¹ Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him
      king. '
    2: '² When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where
      he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. '
    3: '³ And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel
      came and said to Rehoboam, '
    4: '⁴ “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service
      of your father and his heavy yoke that he placed on us, and we will serve you.” '
    5: "⁵ He said to them, “Go away for three days, then come again to me.” So the\
      \ people went away. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the older men who had attended his
      father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer
      this people?” '
    7: '⁷ They answered him, “If you will be a servant to this people today and serve
      them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your
      servants forever.” '
    8: '⁸ But he disregarded the advice that the older men gave him, and consulted
      with the young men who had grown up with him and now attended him. '
    9: '⁹ He said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have
      said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?” '
    10: '¹⁰ The young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus you should
      say to this people who spoke to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you
      must lighten it for us’; thus you should say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker
      than my father’s loins. '
    11: "¹¹ Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.\
      \ My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
      king had said, “Come to me again the third day.” '
    13: '¹³ The king answered the people harshly. He disregarded the advice that the
      older men had given him '
    14: '¹⁴ and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, “My father
      made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you
      with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” '
    15: "¹⁵ So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of affairs\
      \ brought about by the Lord that he might fulfill his word, which the Lord had\
      \ spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people\
      \ answered the king,\n“What share do we have in David?\n    We have no inheritance\
      \ in the son of Jesse.\nTo your tents, O Israel!\n    Look now to your own house,\
      \ O David.”\nSo Israel went away to their tents. "
    17: '¹⁷ But Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites who were living in the towns
      of Judah. '
    18: '¹⁸ When King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor,
      all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam then hurriedly mounted his chariot
      to flee to Jerusalem. '
    19: "¹⁹ So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called\
      \ him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who\
      \ followed the house of David, except the tribe of Judah alone. \n"
    21: '²¹ When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and
      the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen troops to fight against
      the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. '
    22: '²² But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: '
    23: '²³ Say to King Rehoboam of Judah, son of Solomon, and to all the house of
      Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, '
    24: "²⁴ “Thus says the Lord, You shall not go up or fight against your kindred\
      \ the people of Israel. Let everyone go home, for this thing is from me.” So\
      \ they heeded the word of the Lord and went home again, according to the word\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and resided
      there; he went out from there and built Penuel. '
    26: '²⁶ Then Jeroboam said to himself, “Now the kingdom may well revert to the
      house of David. '
    27: '²⁷ If this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices in the house of
      the Lord at Jerusalem, the heart of this people will turn again to their master,
      King Rehoboam of Judah; they will kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah.” '
    28: '²⁸ So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. He said to the
      people, “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Here are your gods, O Israel,
      who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” '
    29: '²⁹ He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. '
    30: '³⁰ And this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the
      one at Bethel and before the other as far as Dan. '
    31: '³¹ He also made houses on high places, and appointed priests from among all
      the people, who were not Levites. '
    32: '³² Jeroboam appointed a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month
      like the festival that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar;
      so he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed
      in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. '
    33: ³³ He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day
      in the eighth month, in the month that he alone had devised; he appointed a
      festival for the people of Israel, and he went up to the altar to offer incense.
  13:
    1: '¹ While Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense, a man of God
      came out of Judah by the word of the Lord to Bethel '
    2: '² and proclaimed against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, “O altar,
      altar, thus says the Lord: ‘A son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah
      by name; and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer
      incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’” '
    3: '³ He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the Lord has
      spoken: ‘The altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be
      poured out.’” '
    4: '⁴ When the king heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel,
      Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But the
      hand that he stretched out against him withered so that he could not draw it
      back to himself. '
    5: '⁵ The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according
      to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ The king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the Lord your
      God, and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of
      God entreated the Lord; and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became
      as it was before. '
    7: '⁷ Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and dine, and I
      will give you a gift.” '
    8: '⁸ But the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your kingdom,
      I will not go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water in this place. '
    9: '⁹ For thus I was commanded by the word of the Lord: You shall not eat food,
      or drink water, or return by the way that you came.” '
    10: "¹⁰ So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he had come\
      \ to Bethel. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel. One of his sons came and told
      him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words also that
      he had spoken to the king, they told to their father. '
    12: '¹² Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed
      him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone. '
    13: '¹³ Then he said to his sons, “Saddle a donkey for me.” So they saddled a
      donkey for him, and he mounted it. '
    14: '¹⁴ He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak tree.
      He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He answered, “I
      am.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat some food.” '
    16: '¹⁶ But he said, “I cannot return with you, or go in with you; nor will I
      eat food or drink water with you in this place; '
    17: '¹⁷ for it was said to me by the word of the Lord: You shall not eat food
      or drink water there, or return by the way that you came.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then the other said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel
      spoke to me by the word of the Lord: Bring him back with you into your house
      so that he may eat food and drink water.” But he was deceiving him. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the man of God went back with him, and ate food and drank water in\
      \ his house. \n"
    20: '²⁰ As they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet
      who had brought him back; '
    21: '²¹ and he proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says the
      Lord: Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord, and have not kept the
      commandment that the Lord your God commanded you, '
    22: '²² but have come back and have eaten food and drunk water in the place of
      which he said to you, ‘Eat no food, and drink no water,’ your body shall not
      come to your ancestral tomb.” '
    23: '²³ After the man of God had eaten food and had drunk, they saddled for him
      a donkey belonging to the prophet who had brought him back. '
    24: '²⁴ Then as he went away, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body
      was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood
      beside the body. '
    25: "²⁵ People passed by and saw the body thrown in the road, with the lion standing\
      \ by the body. And they came and told it in the town where the old prophet lived.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he
      said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord; therefore the
      Lord has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him according
      to the word that the Lord spoke to him.” '
    27: '²⁷ Then he said to his sons, “Saddle a donkey for me.” So they saddled one, '
    28: '²⁸ and he went and found the body thrown in the road, with the donkey and
      the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked
      the donkey. '
    29: '²⁹ The prophet took up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey,
      and brought it back to the city, to mourn and to bury him. '
    30: '³⁰ He laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying,
      “Alas, my brother!” '
    31: '³¹ After he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in
      the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. '
    32: "³² For the saying that he proclaimed by the word of the Lord against the\
      \ altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places that are in\
      \ the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.” \n"
    33: '³³ Even after this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made
      priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who wanted
      to be priests he consecrated for the high places. '
    34: ³⁴ This matter became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and
      to destroy it from the face of the earth.
  14:
    1: '¹ At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam fell sick. '
    2: '² Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so that it will not be
      known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; for the prophet Ahijah
      is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people. '
    3: "³ Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him;\
      \ he will tell you what shall happen to the child.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Jeroboam’s wife did so; she set out and went to Shiloh, and came to the
      house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of
      his age. '
    5: "⁵ But the Lord said to Ahijah, “The wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire\
      \ of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to\
      \ her.”\nWhen she came, she pretended to be another woman. "
    6: '⁶ But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door,
      he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you pretend to be another? For I
      am charged with heavy tidings for you. '
    7: '⁷ Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because I exalted
      you from among the people, made you leader over my people Israel, '
    8: '⁸ and tore the kingdom away from the house of David to give it to you; yet
      you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed
      me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my sight, '
    9: '⁹ but you have done evil above all those who were before you and have gone
      and made for yourself other gods, and cast images, provoking me to anger, and
      have thrust me behind your back; '
    10: '¹⁰ therefore, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off
      from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will consume the
      house of Jeroboam, just as one burns up dung until it is all gone. '
    11: '¹¹ Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs shall eat;
      and anyone who dies in the open country, the birds of the air shall eat; for
      the Lord has spoken.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore set out, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the
      child shall die. '
    13: '¹³ All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him; for he alone of Jeroboam’s
      family shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing
      to the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel, who shall\
      \ cut off the house of Jeroboam today, even right now! \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “The Lord will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; he will
      root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their ancestors, and scatter
      them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their sacred poles, provoking
      the Lord to anger. '
    16: "¹⁶ He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned\
      \ and which he caused Israel to commit.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and went away, and she came to Tirzah. As
      she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. '
    18: "¹⁸ All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the\
      \ Lord, which he spoke by his servant the prophet Ahijah. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned,
      are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel. '
    20: "²⁰ The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; then he slept with\
      \ his ancestors, and his son Nadab succeeded him. \n"
    21: '²¹ Now Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years
      old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the
      city that the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name
      there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. '
    22: '²² Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord; they provoked him to
      jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their ancestors
      had done. '
    23: '²³ For they also built for themselves high places, pillars, and sacred poles
      on every high hill and under every green tree; '
    24: "²⁴ there were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They committed all\
      \ the abominations of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    25: '²⁵ In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt came up against
      Jerusalem; '
    26: '²⁶ he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures
      of the king’s house; he took everything. He also took away all the shields of
      gold that Solomon had made; '
    27: '²⁷ so King Rehoboam made shields of bronze instead, and committed them to
      the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. '
    28: "²⁸ As often as the king went into the house of the Lord, the guard carried\
      \ them and brought them back to the guardroom. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not
      written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? '
    30: '³⁰ There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. '
    31: ³¹ Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in
      the city of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. His son Abijam
      succeeded him.
  15:
    1: '¹ Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam began to
      reign over Judah. '
    2: '² He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah daughter
      of Abishalom. '
    3: '³ He committed all the sins that his father did before him; his heart was
      not true to the Lord his God, like the heart of his father David. '
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem,
      setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem; '
    5: '⁵ because David did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and did not turn
      aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in
      the matter of Uriah the Hittite. '
    6: '⁶ The war begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued all the days of his
      life. '
    7: '⁷ The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written
      in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam
      and Jeroboam. '
    8: "⁸ Abijam slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David.\
      \ Then his son Asa succeeded him. \n"
    9: '⁹ In the twentieth year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa began to reign over
      Judah; '
    10: '¹⁰ he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah
      daughter of Abishalom. '
    11: '¹¹ Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David had
      done. '
    12: '¹² He put away the male temple prostitutes out of the land, and removed all
      the idols that his ancestors had made. '
    13: '¹³ He also removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she
      had made an abominable image for Asherah; Asa cut down her image and burned
      it at the Wadi Kidron. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa
      was true to the Lord all his days. '
    15: "¹⁵ He brought into the house of the Lord the votive gifts of his father and\
      \ his own votive gifts—silver, gold, and utensils. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days. '
    17: '¹⁷ King Baasha of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, to prevent
      anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures
      of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house, and gave them
      into the hands of his servants. King Asa sent them to King Ben-hadad son of
      Tabrimmon son of Hezion of Aram, who resided in Damascus, saying, '
    19: '¹⁹ “Let there be an alliance between me and you, like that between my father
      and your father: I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go, break your
      alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he may withdraw from me.” '
    20: '²⁰ Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies
      against the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and
      all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. '
    21: '²¹ When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and lived in Tirzah. '
    22: '²² Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt: they
      carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been
      building; with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. '
    23: '²³ Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his power, all that he did, and
      the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of
      the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet. '
    24: "²⁴ Then Asa slept with his ancestors, and was buried with his ancestors in\
      \ the city of his father David; his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of
      King Asa of Judah; he reigned over Israel two years. '
    26: "²⁶ He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of his\
      \ ancestor and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Baasha son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him;
      and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines;
      for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. '
    28: '²⁸ So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa of Judah, and succeeded
      him. '
    29: '²⁹ As soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam; he left to
      the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according
      to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite— '
    30: "³⁰ because of the sins of Jeroboam that he committed and that he caused Israel\
      \ to commit, and because of the anger to which he provoked the Lord, the God\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    31: '³¹ Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written
      in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? '
    32: "³² There was war between Asa and King Baasha of Israel all their days. \n"
    33: '³³ In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began to
      reign over all Israel at Tirzah; he reigned twenty-four years. '
    34: ³⁴ He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam
      and in the sin that he caused Israel to commit.
  16:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, '
    2: '² “Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people
      Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have caused my people
      Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins, '
    3: '³ therefore, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house
      like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat. '
    4: "⁴ Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and\
      \ anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his power, are they
      not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? '
    6: '⁶ Baasha slept with his ancestors, and was buried at Tirzah; and his son Elah
      succeeded him. '
    7: "⁷ Moreover the word of the Lord came by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against\
      \ Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight\
      \ of the Lord, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like\
      \ the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it. \n"
    8: '⁸ In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasha began
      to reign over Israel in Tirzah; he reigned two years. '
    9: '⁹ But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against
      him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who
      was in charge of the palace at Tirzah, '
    10: "¹⁰ Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh\
      \ year of King Asa of Judah, and succeeded him. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne,
      he killed all the house of Baasha; he did not leave him a single male of his
      kindred or his friends. '
    12: '¹² Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of
      the Lord, which he spoke against Baasha by the prophet Jehu— '
    13: '¹³ because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Elah that they
      committed, and that they caused Israel to commit, provoking the Lord God of
      Israel to anger with their idols. '
    14: "¹⁴ Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written\
      \ in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days
      in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to
      the Philistines, '
    16: '¹⁶ and the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired,
      and he has killed the king”; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of
      the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. '
    17: '¹⁷ So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged
      Tirzah. '
    18: '¹⁸ When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the
      king’s house; he burned down the king’s house over himself with fire, and died— '
    19: '¹⁹ because of the sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the
      Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for the sin that he committed, causing
      Israel to sin. '
    20: "²⁰ Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are\
      \ they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? \n"
    21: '²¹ Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people
      followed Tibni son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. '
    22: '²² But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni
      son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king. '
    23: "²³ In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri began to reign over\
      \ Israel; he reigned for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. \n"
    24: "²⁴ He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; he\
      \ fortified the hill, and called the city that he built, Samaria, after the\
      \ name of Shemer, the owner of the hill. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Omri did what was evil in the sight of the Lord; he did more evil than
      all who were before him. '
    26: '²⁶ For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in the sins
      that he caused Israel to commit, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger
      by their idols. '
    27: '²⁷ Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the power that he showed,
      are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? '
    28: "²⁸ Omri slept with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria; his son Ahab\
      \ succeeded him. \n"
    29: '²⁹ In the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri began
      to reign over Israel; Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two
      years. '
    30: "³⁰ Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were\
      \ before him. \n"
    31: '³¹ And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam
      son of Nebat, he took as his wife Jezebel daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians,
      and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. '
    32: '³² He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. '
    33: '³³ Ahab also made a sacred pole. Ahab did more to provoke the anger of the
      Lord, the God of Israel, than had all the kings of Israel who were before him. '
    34: ³⁴ In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the
      cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest
      son Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Joshua son of
      Nun.
  17:
    1: '¹ Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord
      the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor
      rain these years, except by my word.” '
    2: '² The word of the Lord came to him, saying, '
    3: '³ “Go from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Wadi Cherith,
      which is east of the Jordan. '
    4: '⁴ You shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you
      there.” '
    5: '⁵ So he went and did according to the word of the Lord; he went and lived
      by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. '
    6: '⁶ The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat
      in the evening; and he drank from the wadi. '
    7: "⁷ But after a while the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Go now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live there; for I have
      commanded a widow there to feed you.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So he set out and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town,
      a widow was there gathering sticks; he called to her and said, “Bring me a little
      water in a vessel, so that I may drink.” '
    11: '¹¹ As she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Bring me a morsel
      of bread in your hand.” '
    12: '¹² But she said, “As the Lord your God lives, I have nothing baked, only
      a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a
      couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son,
      that we may eat it, and die.” '
    13: '¹³ Elijah said to her, “Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but
      first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something
      for yourself and your son. '
    14: '¹⁴ For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be
      emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain
      on the earth.” '
    15: '¹⁵ She went and did as Elijah said, so that she as well as he and her household
      ate for many days. '
    16: "¹⁶ The jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail, according\
      \ to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill;
      his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. '
    18: '¹⁸ She then said to Elijah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You
      have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my
      son!” '
    19: '¹⁹ But he said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him from her bosom, carried
      him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging, and laid him on his own
      bed. '
    20: '²⁰ He cried out to the Lord, “O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even
      upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?” '
    21: '²¹ Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to
      the Lord, “O Lord my God, let this child’s life come into him again.” '
    22: '²² The Lord listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into
      him again, and he revived. '
    23: '²³ Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the
      house, and gave him to his mother; then Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.” '
    24: ²⁴ So the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and
      that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.”
  18:
    1: '¹ After many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year of
      the drought, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab; I will send rain on the
      earth.” '
    2: '² So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. '
    3: '³ Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Now Obadiah revered
      the Lord greatly; '
    4: '⁴ when Jezebel was killing off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred
      prophets, hid them fifty to a cave, and provided them with bread and water.) '
    5: '⁵ Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water
      and to all the wadis; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules
      alive, and not lose some of the animals.” '
    6: "⁶ So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one\
      \ direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself. \n"
    7: '⁷ As Obadiah was on the way, Elijah met him; Obadiah recognized him, fell
      on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” '
    8: '⁸ He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here.” '
    9: '⁹ And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would hand your servant over to
      Ahab, to kill me? '
    10: '¹⁰ As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my
      lord has not sent to seek you; and when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he
      would require an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. '
    11: '¹¹ But now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here.’ '
    12: '¹² As soon as I have gone from you, the spirit of the Lord will carry you
      I know not where; so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will
      kill me, although I your servant have revered the Lord from my youth. '
    13: '¹³ Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets
      of the Lord, how I hid a hundred of the Lord’s prophets fifty to a cave, and
      provided them with bread and water? '
    14: '¹⁴ Yet now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here’; he will surely
      kill me.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Elijah said, “As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will
      surely show myself to him today.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?” '
    18: '¹⁸ He answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father’s
      house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and followed the
      Baals. '
    19: "¹⁹ Now therefore have all Israel assemble for me at Mount Carmel, with the\
      \ four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah,\
      \ who eat at Jezebel’s table.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ So Ahab sent to all the Israelites, and assembled the prophets at Mount
      Carmel. '
    21: '²¹ Elijah then came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you
      go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but
      if Baal, then follow him.” The people did not answer him a word. '
    22: '²² Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of
      the Lord; but Baal’s prophets number four hundred fifty. '
    23: '²³ Let two bulls be given to us; let them choose one bull for themselves,
      cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; I will prepare
      the other bull and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. '
    24: '²⁴ Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the
      Lord; the god who answers by fire is indeed God.” All the people answered, “Well
      spoken!” '
    25: '²⁵ Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull
      and prepare it first, for you are many; then call on the name of your god, but
      put no fire to it.” '
    26: '²⁶ So they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on
      the name of Baal from morning until noon, crying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there
      was no voice, and no answer. They limped about the altar that they had made. '
    27: '²⁷ At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either
      he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps
      he is asleep and must be awakened.” '
    28: '²⁸ Then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with
      swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them. '
    29: "²⁹ As midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the\
      \ oblation, but there was no voice, no answer, and no response. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come closer to me”; and all the people
      came closer to him. First he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been thrown
      down; '
    31: '³¹ Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the
      sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying, “Israel shall be your
      name”; '
    32: '³² with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. Then he made
      a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. '
    33: '³³ Next he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on
      the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering
      and on the wood.” '
    34: '³⁴ Then he said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. Again
      he said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it a third time, '
    35: "³⁵ so that the water ran all around the altar, and filled the trench also\
      \ with water. \n"
    36: '³⁶ At the time of the offering of the oblation, the prophet Elijah came near
      and said, “O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day
      that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all
      these things at your bidding. '
    37: '³⁷ Answer me, O Lord, answer me, so that this people may know that you, O
      Lord, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” '
    38: '³⁸ Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood,
      the stones, and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the trench. '
    39: '³⁹ When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The Lord
      indeed is God; the Lord indeed is God.” '
    40: "⁴⁰ Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them\
      \ escape.” Then they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon,\
      \ and killed them there. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of rushing
      rain.” '
    42: '⁴² So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel;
      there he bowed himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees. '
    43: '⁴³ He said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” He went up and
      looked, and said, “There is nothing.” Then he said, “Go again seven times.” '
    44: '⁴⁴ At the seventh time he said, “Look, a little cloud no bigger than a person’s
      hand is rising out of the sea.” Then he said, “Go say to Ahab, ‘Harness your
      chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’” '
    45: '⁴⁵ In a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind; there was
      a heavy rain. Ahab rode off and went to Jezreel. '
    46: ⁴⁶ But the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; he girded up his loins and ran
      in front of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
  19:
    1: '¹ Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the
      prophets with the sword. '
    2: '² Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to
      me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by
      this time tomorrow.” '
    3: "³ Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba,\
      \ which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there. \n"
    4: '⁴ But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat
      down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: “It is enough;
      now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.” '
    5: '⁵ Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel
      touched him and said to him, “Get up and eat.” '
    6: '⁶ He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar
      of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. '
    7: '⁷ The angel of the Lord came a second time, touched him, and said, “Get up
      and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.” '
    8: '⁸ He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food
      forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. '
    9: "⁹ At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.\nThen the word\
      \ of the Lord came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” "
    10: "¹⁰ He answered, “I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts;\
      \ for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and\
      \ killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking\
      \ my life, to take it away.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord, for the Lord
      is about to pass by.” Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting
      mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not
      in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; '
    12: '¹² and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and
      after the fire a sound of sheer silence. '
    13: '¹³ When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and
      stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said,
      “What are you doing here, Elijah?” '
    14: '¹⁴ He answered, “I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts;
      for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and
      killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my
      life, to take it away.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Lord said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of
      Damascus; when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Aram. '
    16: '¹⁶ Also you shall anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel; and you
      shall anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place. '
    17: '¹⁷ Whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and whoever
      escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill. '
    18: "¹⁸ Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not\
      \ bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So he set out from there, and found Elisha son of Shaphat, who was plowing.
      There were twelve yoke of oxen ahead of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah
      passed by him and threw his mantle over him. '
    20: '²⁰ He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and
      my mother, and then I will follow you.” Then Elijah said to him, “Go back again;
      for what have I done to you?” '
    21: ²¹ He returned from following him, took the yoke of oxen, and slaughtered
      them; using the equipment from the oxen, he boiled their flesh, and gave it
      to the people, and they ate. Then he set out and followed Elijah, and became
      his servant.
  20:
    1: '¹ King Ben-hadad of Aram gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings
      were with him, along with horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria, laid
      siege to it, and attacked it. '
    2: '² Then he sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel, and said to
      him: “Thus says Ben-hadad: '
    3: '³ Your silver and gold are mine; your fairest wives and children also are
      mine.” '
    4: '⁴ The king of Israel answered, “As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and
      all that I have.” '
    5: '⁵ The messengers came again and said: “Thus says Ben-hadad: I sent to you,
      saying, ‘Deliver to me your silver and gold, your wives and children’; '
    6: "⁶ nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and\
      \ they shall search your house and the houses of your servants, and lay hands\
      \ on whatever pleases them, and take it away.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Look
      now! See how this man is seeking trouble; for he sent to me for my wives, my
      children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not refuse him.” '
    8: '⁸ Then all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.” '
    9: '⁹ So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king: All that
      you first demanded of your servant I will do; but this thing I cannot do.” The
      messengers left and brought him word again. '
    10: '¹⁰ Ben-hadad sent to him and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also,
      if the dust of Samaria will provide a handful for each of the people who follow
      me.” '
    11: '¹¹ The king of Israel answered, “Tell him: One who puts on armor should not
      brag like one who takes it off.” '
    12: "¹² When Ben-hadad heard this message—now he had been drinking with the kings\
      \ in the booths—he said to his men, “Take your positions!” And they took their\
      \ positions against the city. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then a certain prophet came up to King Ahab of Israel and said, “Thus
      says the Lord, Have you seen all this great multitude? Look, I will give it
      into your hand today; and you shall know that I am the Lord.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Ahab said, “By whom?” He said, “Thus says the Lord, By the young men who
      serve the district governors.” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” He
      answered, “You.” '
    15: "¹⁵ Then he mustered the young men who served the district governors, two\
      \ hundred thirty-two; after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven\
      \ thousand. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the
      booths, he and the thirty-two kings allied with him. '
    17: '¹⁷ The young men who served the district governors went out first. Ben-hadad
      had sent out scouts, and they reported to him, “Men have come out from Samaria.” '
    18: "¹⁸ He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have\
      \ come out for war, take them alive.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ But these had already come out of the city: the young men who served the
      district governors, and the army that followed them. '
    20: '²⁰ Each killed his man; the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, but King
      Ben-hadad of Aram escaped on a horse with the cavalry. '
    21: "²¹ The king of Israel went out, attacked the horses and chariots, and defeated\
      \ the Arameans with a great slaughter. \n"
    22: "²² Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Come,\
      \ strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do; for in the spring\
      \ the king of Aram will come up against you.” \n"
    23: '²³ The servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of
      the hills, and so they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them
      in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. '
    24: '²⁴ Also do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders
      in place of them; '
    25: "²⁵ and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse,\
      \ and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, and\
      \ surely we shall be stronger than they.” He heeded their voice, and did so.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ In the spring Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to
      fight against Israel. '
    27: '²⁷ After the Israelites had been mustered and provisioned, they went out
      to engage them; the people of Israel encamped opposite them like two little
      flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the country. '
    28: '²⁸ A man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says the
      Lord: Because the Arameans have said, ‘The Lord is a god of the hills but he
      is not a god of the valleys,’ therefore I will give all this great multitude
      into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.” '
    29: '²⁹ They encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day
      the battle began; the Israelites killed one hundred thousand Aramean foot soldiers
      in one day. '
    30: "³⁰ The rest fled into the city of Aphek; and the wall fell on twenty-seven\
      \ thousand men that were left.\nBen-hadad also fled, and entered the city to\
      \ hide. "
    31: '³¹ His servants said to him, “Look, we have heard that the kings of the house
      of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes
      on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.” '
    32: '³² So they tied sackcloth around their waists, put ropes on their heads,
      went to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please
      let me live.’” And he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” '
    33: '³³ Now the men were watching for an omen; they quickly took it up from him
      and said, “Yes, Ben-hadad is your brother.” Then he said, “Go and bring him.”
      So Ben-hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot. '
    34: "³⁴ Ben-hadad said to him, “I will restore the towns that my father took from\
      \ your father; and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my\
      \ father did in Samaria.” The king of Israel responded, “I will let you go on\
      \ those terms.” So he made a treaty with him and let him go. \n"
    35: '³⁵ At the command of the Lord a certain member of a company of prophets said
      to another, “Strike me!” But the man refused to strike him. '
    36: '³⁶ Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord,
      as soon as you have left me, a lion will kill you.” And when he had left him,
      a lion met him and killed him. '
    37: '³⁷ Then he found another man and said, “Strike me!” So the man hit him, striking
      and wounding him. '
    38: '³⁸ Then the prophet departed, and waited for the king along the road, disguising
      himself with a bandage over his eyes. '
    39: '³⁹ As the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went
      out into the thick of the battle; then a soldier turned and brought a man to
      me, and said, ‘Guard this man; if he is missing, your life shall be given for
      his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’ '
    40: '⁴⁰ While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of
      Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.” '
    41: '⁴¹ Then he quickly took the bandage away from his eyes. The king of Israel
      recognized him as one of the prophets. '
    42: '⁴² Then he said to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Because you have let the man
      go whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life,
      and your people for his people.’” '
    43: ⁴³ The king of Israel set out toward home, resentful and sullen, and came
      to Samaria.
  21:
    1: '¹ Later the following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard
      in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. '
    2: '² And Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for
      a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard
      for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.” '
    3: '³ But Naboth said to Ahab, “The Lord forbid that I should give you my ancestral
      inheritance.” '
    4: "⁴ Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite\
      \ had said to him; for he had said, “I will not give you my ancestral inheritance.”\
      \ He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat. \n"
    5: '⁵ His wife Jezebel came to him and said, “Why are you so depressed that you
      will not eat?” '
    6: '⁶ He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him,
      ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another
      vineyard for it’; but he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’” '
    7: "⁷ His wife Jezebel said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some\
      \ food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal; she sent
      the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. '
    9: '⁹ She wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head
      of the assembly; '
    10: '¹⁰ seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against
      him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out, and stone
      him to death.” '
    11: '¹¹ The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city,
      did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters
      that she had sent to them, '
    12: '¹² they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly. '
    13: '¹³ The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought
      a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed
      God and the king.” So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel
      said to Ahab, “Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
      which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” '
    16: "¹⁶ As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to\
      \ the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: '
    18: '¹⁸ Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in
      the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. '
    19: "¹⁹ You shall say to him, “Thus says the Lord: Have you killed, and also taken\
      \ possession?” You shall say to him, “Thus says the Lord: In the place where\
      \ dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I
      have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight
      of the Lord, '
    21: '²¹ I will bring disaster on you; I will consume you, and will cut off from
      Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel; '
    22: '²² and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and
      like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger
      and have caused Israel to sin. '
    23: '²³ Also concerning Jezebel the Lord said, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel within
      the bounds of Jezreel.’ '
    24: "²⁴ Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and\
      \ anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat.”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ (Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do what was evil
      in the sight of the Lord, urged on by his wife Jezebel. '
    26: "²⁶ He acted most abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done,\
      \ whom the Lord drove out before the Israelites.) \n"
    27: '²⁷ When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over
      his bare flesh; he fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly. '
    28: '²⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite: '
    29: ²⁹ “Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled
      himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son’s
      days I will bring the disaster on his house.”
  22:
    1: '¹ For three years Aram and Israel continued without war. '
    2: '² But in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to the king of
      Israel. '
    3: '³ The king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead
      belongs to us, yet we are doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king
      of Aram?” '
    4: "⁴ He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?”\
      \ Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are; my people are\
      \ your people, my horses are your horses.” \n"
    5: '⁵ But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the
      word of the Lord.” '
    6: '⁶ Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred
      of them, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall
      I refrain?” They said, “Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the
      king.” '
    7: '⁷ But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no other prophet of the Lord here of whom
      we may inquire?” '
    8: '⁸ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one other by whom
      we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never
      prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster.” Jehoshaphat said,
      “Let the king not say such a thing.” '
    9: '⁹ Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah
      son of Imlah.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their
      thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the
      gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. '
    11: '¹¹ Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said,
      “Thus says the Lord: With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.” '
    12: "¹² All the prophets were prophesying the same and saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead\
      \ and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” \n"
    13: '¹³ The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the words
      of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be
      like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” '
    14: "¹⁴ But Micaiah said, “As the Lord lives, whatever the Lord says to me, that\
      \ I will speak.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we
      go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” He answered him, “Go up
      and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” '
    16: '¹⁶ But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell
      me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then Micaiah said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like
      sheep that have no shepherd; and the Lord said, ‘These have no master; let each
      one go home in peace.’” '
    18: "¹⁸ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would\
      \ not prophesy anything favorable about me, but only disaster?” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord
      sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing beside him to the
      right and to the left of him. '
    20: '²⁰ And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, so that he may go up and fall
      at Ramoth-gilead?’ Then one said one thing, and another said another, '
    21: '²¹ until a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, ‘I will
      entice him.’ '
    22: '²² ‘How?’ the Lord asked him. He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit
      in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then the Lord said, ‘You are to entice him,
      and you shall succeed; go out and do it.’ '
    23: "²³ So you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these\
      \ your prophets; the Lord has decreed disaster for you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up to Micaiah, slapped him on the
      cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak
      to you?” '
    25: '²⁵ Micaiah replied, “You will find out on that day when you go in to hide
      in an inner chamber.” '
    26: '²⁶ The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon
      the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son, '
    27: '²⁷ and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him
      on reduced rations of bread and water until I come in peace.’” '
    28: "²⁸ Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.”\
      \ And he said, “Hear, you peoples, all of you!” \n"
    29: '²⁹ So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. '
    30: '³⁰ The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go
      into battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself
      and went into battle. '
    31: '³¹ Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots,
      “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.” '
    32: '³² When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is surely
      the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried
      out. '
    33: '³³ When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel,
      they turned back from pursuing him. '
    34: '³⁴ But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel
      between the scale armor and the breastplate; so he said to the driver of his
      chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” '
    35: '³⁵ The battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot
      facing the Arameans, until at evening he died; the blood from the wound had
      flowed into the bottom of the chariot. '
    36: "³⁶ Then about sunset a shout went through the army, “Every man to his city,\
      \ and every man to his country!” \n"
    37: '³⁷ So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; they buried the king in
      Samaria. '
    38: '³⁸ They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; the dogs licked up his
      blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of
      the Lord that he had spoken. '
    39: '³⁹ Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house
      that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the
      Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel? '
    40: "⁴⁰ So Ahab slept with his ancestors; and his son Ahaziah succeeded him. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of
      King Ahab of Israel. '
    42: '⁴² Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
      twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. '
    43: '⁴³ He walked in all the way of his father Asa; he did not turn aside from
      it, doing what was right in the sight of the Lord; yet the high places were
      not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and offered incense on the high
      places. '
    44: "⁴⁴ Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his power that he showed,
      and how he waged war, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the
      Kings of Judah? '
    46: "⁴⁶ The remnant of the male temple prostitutes who were still in the land\
      \ in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Jehoshaphat made ships of the Tarshish type to go to Ophir for gold; but
      they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with
      your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshaphat was not willing. '
    50: "⁵⁰ Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors\
      \ in the city of his father David; his son Jehoram succeeded him. \n"
    51: '⁵¹ Ahaziah son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth
      year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah; he reigned two years over Israel. '
    52: '⁵² He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of
      his father and mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel
      to sin. '
    53: ⁵³ He served Baal and worshiped him; he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel,
      to anger, just as his father had done.
