Revelation:
  1:
    1: '¹ The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants
      what must soon take place; he made it known by sending his angel to his servant
      John, '
    2: "² who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even\
      \ to all that he saw. \n"
    3: "³ Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed\
      \ are those who hear and who keep what is written in it; for the time is near.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ John to the seven churches that are in Asia:\nGrace to you and peace from\
      \ him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who\
      \ are before his throne, "
    5: "⁵ and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead,\
      \ and the ruler of the kings of the earth.\nTo him who loves us and freed us\
      \ from our sins by his blood, "
    6: "⁶ and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him\
      \ be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    7: "⁷ Look! He is coming with the clouds;\n    every eye will see him,\neven those\
      \ who pierced him;\n    and on his account all the tribes of the earth will\
      \ wail.\nSo it is to be. Amen. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, who is and who was and\
      \ who is to come, the Almighty. \n"
    9: '⁹ I, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and the
      kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos because of
      the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. '
    10: '¹⁰ I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice
      like a trumpet '
    11: "¹¹ saying, “Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches,\
      \ to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia,\
      \ and to Laodicea.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me, and on turning
      I saw seven golden lampstands, '
    13: '¹³ and in the midst of the lampstands I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed
      with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest. '
    14: '¹⁴ His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes
      were like a flame of fire, '
    15: '¹⁵ his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his
      voice was like the sound of many waters. '
    16: "¹⁶ In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp,\
      \ two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right
      hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, '
    18: '¹⁸ and the living one. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever;
      and I have the keys of Death and of Hades. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now write what you have seen, what is, and what is to take place after
      this. '
    20: '²⁰ As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and
      the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
      and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.'
  2:
    1: "¹ “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him\
      \ who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden\
      \ lampstands: \n"
    2: '² “I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance. I know that you
      cannot tolerate evildoers; you have tested those who claim to be apostles but
      are not, and have found them to be false. '
    3: '³ I also know that you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake
      of my name, and that you have not grown weary. '
    4: '⁴ But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at
      first. '
    5: '⁵ Remember then from what you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did
      at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place,
      unless you repent. '
    6: '⁶ Yet this is to your credit: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which
      I also hate. '
    7: "⁷ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\
      \ To everyone who conquers, I will give permission to eat from the tree of life\
      \ that is in the paradise of God. \n"
    8: "⁸ “And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of\
      \ the first and the last, who was dead and came to life: \n"
    9: '⁹ “I know your affliction and your poverty, even though you are rich. I know
      the slander on the part of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but
      are a synagogue of Satan. '
    10: '¹⁰ Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Beware, the devil is about to
      throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and for ten days you
      will have affliction. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown
      of life. '
    11: "¹¹ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\
      \ Whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death. \n"
    12: "¹² “And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words\
      \ of him who has the sharp two-edged sword: \n"
    13: '¹³ “I know where you are living, where Satan’s throne is. Yet you are holding
      fast to my name, and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of Antipas
      my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan lives. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold to the
      teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people
      of Israel, so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice fornication. '
    15: '¹⁵ So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. '
    16: '¹⁶ Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and make war against them
      with the sword of my mouth. '
    17: "¹⁷ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\
      \ To everyone who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will\
      \ give a white stone, and on the white stone is written a new name that no one\
      \ knows except the one who receives it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words\
      \ of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like\
      \ burnished bronze: \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “I know your works—your love, faith, service, and patient endurance. I
      know that your last works are greater than the first. '
    20: '²⁰ But I have this against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls
      herself a prophet and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice fornication
      and to eat food sacrificed to idols. '
    21: '²¹ I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her fornication. '
    22: '²² Beware, I am throwing her on a bed, and those who commit adultery with
      her I am throwing into great distress, unless they repent of her doings; '
    23: '²³ and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that
      I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you as
      your works deserve. '
    24: '²⁴ But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who
      have not learned what some call ‘the deep things of Satan,’ to you I say, I
      do not lay on you any other burden; '
    25: '²⁵ only hold fast to what you have until I come. '
    26: "²⁶ To everyone who conquers and continues to do my works to the end,\nI will\
      \ give authority over the nations;\n"
    27: "²⁷ to rule them with an iron rod,\n    as when clay pots are shattered— \n"
    28: '²⁸ even as I also received authority from my Father. To the one who conquers
      I will also give the morning star. '
    29: ²⁹ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
  3:
    1: "¹ “And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of\
      \ him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars:\n“I know your works;\
      \ you have a name of being alive, but you are dead. "
    2: '² Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I
      have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God. '
    3: '³ Remember then what you received and heard; obey it, and repent. If you do
      not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I
      will come to you. '
    4: '⁴ Yet you have still a few persons in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes;
      they will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. '
    5: '⁵ If you conquer, you will be clothed like them in white robes, and I will
      not blot your name out of the book of life; I will confess your name before
      my Father and before his angels. '
    6: "⁶ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ “And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:\nThese are the words\
      \ of the holy one, the true one,\n    who has the key of David,\n    who opens\
      \ and no one will shut,\n        who shuts and no one opens: \n"
    8: '⁸ “I know your works. Look, I have set before you an open door, which no one
      is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept
      my word and have not denied my name. '
    9: '⁹ I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and
      are not, but are lying—I will make them come and bow down before your feet,
      and they will learn that I have loved you. '
    10: '¹⁰ Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from
      the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world to test the inhabitants
      of the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ I am coming soon; hold fast to what you have, so that no one may seize
      your crown. '
    12: '¹² If you conquer, I will make you a pillar in the temple of my God; you
      will never go out of it. I will write on you the name of my God, and the name
      of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from my God out of
      heaven, and my own new name. '
    13: "¹³ Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The words of the Amen,\
      \ the faithful and true witness, the origin of God’s creation: \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “I know your works; you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were
      either cold or hot. '
    16: '¹⁶ So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to
      spit you out of my mouth. '
    17: '¹⁷ For you say, ‘I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing.’ You do
      not realize that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. '
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you
      may be rich; and white robes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nakedness
      from being seen; and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see. '
    19: '¹⁹ I reprove and discipline those whom I love. Be earnest, therefore, and
      repent. '
    20: '²⁰ Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and
      open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me. '
    21: '²¹ To the one who conquers I will give a place with me on my throne, just
      as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. '
    22: ²² Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”
  4:
    1: '¹ After this I looked, and there in heaven a door stood open! And the first
      voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here,
      and I will show you what must take place after this.” '
    2: '² At once I was in the spirit, and there in heaven stood a throne, with one
      seated on the throne! '
    3: '³ And the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian, and around the
      throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald. '
    4: '⁴ Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones are
      twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads. '
    5: '⁵ Coming from the throne are flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals
      of thunder, and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches, which are
      the seven spirits of God; '
    6: "⁶ and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass, like\
      \ crystal.\nAround the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living\
      \ creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: "
    7: '⁷ the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an
      ox, the third living creature with a face like a human face, and the fourth
      living creature like a flying eagle. '
    8: "⁸ And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of\
      \ eyes all around and inside. Day and night without ceasing they sing,\n“Holy,\
      \ holy, holy,\nthe Lord God the Almighty,\n    who was and is and is to come.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the
      one who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, '
    10: "¹⁰ the twenty-four elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne\
      \ and worship the one who lives forever and ever; they cast their crowns before\
      \ the throne, singing, \n"
    11: "¹¹ “You are worthy, our Lord and God,\n    to receive glory and honor and\
      \ power,\nfor you created all things,\n    and by your will they existed and\
      \ were created.”"
  5:
    1: '¹ Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written
      on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals; '
    2: '² and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to
      open the scroll and break its seals?” '
    3: '³ And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the
      scroll or to look into it. '
    4: '⁴ And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the
      scroll or to look into it. '
    5: "⁵ Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe\
      \ of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll\
      \ and its seven seals.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the
      elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and
      seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. '
    7: '⁷ He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated
      on the throne. '
    8: '⁸ When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four
      elders fell before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense,
      which are the prayers of the saints. '
    9: "⁹ They sing a new song:\n“You are worthy to take the scroll\n    and to open\
      \ its seals,\nfor you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for God\n\
      \    saints from every tribe and language and people and nation;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our God,\n    and\
      \ they will reign on earth.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne
      and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and
      thousands of thousands, '
    12: "¹² singing with full voice,\n“Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered\nto\
      \ receive power and wealth and wisdom and might\nand honor and glory and blessing!”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth\
      \ and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing,\n“To the one seated on the\
      \ throne and to the Lamb\nbe blessing and honor and glory and might\nforever\
      \ and ever!” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the elders fell down and
      worshiped.
  6:
    1: '¹ Then I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the
      four living creatures call out, as with a voice of thunder, “Come!” '
    2: "² I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow; a crown was\
      \ given to him, and he came out conquering and to conquer. \n"
    3: '³ When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature call
      out, “Come!” '
    4: "⁴ And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take\
      \ peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another; and he was\
      \ given a great sword. \n"
    5: '⁵ When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out,
      “Come!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a pair of scales
      in his hand, '
    6: "⁶ and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures\
      \ saying, “A quart of wheat for a day’s pay, and three quarts of barley for\
      \ a day’s pay, but do not damage the olive oil and the wine!” \n"
    7: '⁷ When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature
      call out, “Come!” '
    8: "⁸ I looked and there was a pale green horse! Its rider’s name was Death, and\
      \ Hades followed with him; they were given authority over a fourth of the earth,\
      \ to kill with sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the wild animals of the\
      \ earth. \n"
    9: '⁹ When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those
      who had been slaughtered for the word of God and for the testimony they had
      given; '
    10: '¹⁰ they cried out with a loud voice, “Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how
      long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of
      the earth?” '
    11: "¹¹ They were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until\
      \ the number would be complete both of their fellow servants and of their brothers\
      \ and sisters, who were soon to be killed as they themselves had been killed.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and there came a great earthquake;
      the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood, '
    13: '¹³ and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree drops its winter
      fruit when shaken by a gale. '
    14: '¹⁴ The sky vanished like a scroll rolling itself up, and every mountain and
      island was removed from its place. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the kings of the earth and the magnates and the generals and the
      rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and among
      the rocks of the mountains, '
    16: '¹⁶ calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face
      of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; '
    17: ¹⁷ for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”
  7:
    1: '¹ After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth,
      holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on earth
      or sea or against any tree. '
    2: '² I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal
      of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had
      been given power to damage earth and sea, '
    3: "³ saying, “Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have\
      \ marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.” \n"
    4: "⁴ And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four\
      \ thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the people of Israel: \n"
    5: "⁵ From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed,\nfrom the tribe of Reuben\
      \ twelve thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,\n"
    6: "⁶ from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Naphtali twelve\
      \ thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,\n"
    7: "⁷ from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Levi twelve\
      \ thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,\n"
    8: "⁸ from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Joseph twelve\
      \ thousand,\nfrom the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed. \n"
    9: '⁹ After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count,
      from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before
      the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their
      hands. '
    10: "¹⁰ They cried out in a loud voice, saying,\n“Salvation belongs to our God\
      \ who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the
      four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped
      God, '
    12: "¹² singing,\n“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom\nand thanksgiving and honor\n\
      and power and might\nbe to our God forever and ever! Amen.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, robed in
      white, and where have they come from?” '
    14: "¹⁴ I said to him, “Sir, you are the one that knows.” Then he said to me,\
      \ “These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their\
      \ robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For this reason they are before the throne of God,\n    and worship him\
      \ day and night within his temple,\n    and the one who is seated on the throne\
      \ will shelter them.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;\n    the sun will not strike\
      \ them,\n    nor any scorching heat;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,\n   \
      \ and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,\nand God will wipe\
      \ away every tear from their eyes.”"
  8:
    1: '¹ When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about
      half an hour. '
    2: "² And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were\
      \ given to them. \n"
    3: '³ Another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar; he was given
      a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the
      golden altar that is before the throne. '
    4: '⁴ And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before
      God from the hand of the angel. '
    5: "⁵ Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and\
      \ threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes\
      \ of lightning, and an earthquake. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ The first angel blew his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mixed with\
      \ blood, and they were hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned\
      \ up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned\
      \ up. \n"
    8: '⁸ The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain,
      burning with fire, was thrown into the sea. '
    9: "⁹ A third of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the\
      \ sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing
      like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. '
    11: "¹¹ The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood,\
      \ and many died from the water, because it was made bitter. \n"
    12: "¹² The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck,\
      \ and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their\
      \ light was darkened; a third of the day was kept from shining, and likewise\
      \ the night. \n"
    13: ¹³ Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew
      in midheaven, “Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, at the blasts
      of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”
  9:
    1: '¹ And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from
      heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit; '
    2: '² he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke
      like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with
      the smoke from the shaft. '
    3: '³ Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given authority
      like the authority of scorpions of the earth. '
    4: '⁴ They were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth
      or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their
      foreheads. '
    5: '⁵ They were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them,
      and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone. '
    6: "⁶ And in those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will\
      \ long to die, but death will flee from them. \n"
    7: '⁷ In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their
      heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, '
    8: '⁸ their hair like women’s hair, and their teeth like lions’ teeth; '
    9: '⁹ they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was
      like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have tails like scorpions, with stingers, and in their tails is their
      power to harm people for five months. '
    11: "¹¹ They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name\
      \ in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. \n"
    12: "¹² The first woe has passed. There are still two woes to come. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four
      horns of the golden altar before God, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels
      who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” '
    15: '¹⁵ So the four angels were released, who had been held ready for the hour,
      the day, the month, and the year, to kill a third of humankind. '
    16: '¹⁶ The number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million; I heard their
      number. '
    17: '¹⁷ And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates
      the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur; the heads of the horses were
      like lions’ heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths. '
    18: '¹⁸ By these three plagues a third of humankind was killed, by the fire and
      smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths. '
    19: "¹⁹ For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their\
      \ tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they inflict harm. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The rest of humankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent
      of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and
      silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. '
    21: ²¹ And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication
      or their thefts.
  10:
    1: '¹ And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud,
      with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars
      of fire. '
    2: '² He held a little scroll open in his hand. Setting his right foot on the
      sea and his left foot on the land, '
    3: '³ he gave a great shout, like a lion roaring. And when he shouted, the seven
      thunders sounded. '
    4: '⁴ And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard
      a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and
      do not write it down.” '
    5: "⁵ Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and the land\nraised his right\
      \ hand to heaven\n"
    6: "⁶     and swore by him who lives forever and ever,\nwho created heaven and\
      \ what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it:\
      \ “There will be no more delay, "
    7: "⁷ but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trumpet, the mystery\
      \ of God will be fulfilled, as he announced to his servants the prophets.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go,
      take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the
      sea and on the land.” '
    9: '⁹ So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll; and he
      said to me, “Take it, and eat; it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet
      as honey in your mouth.” '
    10: "¹⁰ So I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it; it\
      \ was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made\
      \ bitter. \n"
    11: ¹¹ Then they said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations
      and languages and kings.”
  11:
    1: '¹ Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Come and
      measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, '
    2: '² but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it
      is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two
      months. '
    3: "³ And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand\
      \ two hundred sixty days, wearing sackcloth.” \n"
    4: '⁴ These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the
      Lord of the earth. '
    5: '⁵ And if anyone wants to harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes
      their foes; anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner. '
    6: "⁶ They have authority to shut the sky, so that no rain may fall during the\
      \ days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn\
      \ them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often\
      \ as they desire. \n"
    7: '⁷ When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the
      bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, '
    8: '⁸ and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically
      called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. '
    9: '⁹ For three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages
      and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed
      in a tomb; '
    10: "¹⁰ and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and\
      \ exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants\
      \ of the earth. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered
      them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified. '
    12: '¹² Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!”
      And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them. '
    13: "¹³ At that moment there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell;\
      \ seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified\
      \ and gave glory to the God of heaven. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The second woe has passed. The third woe is coming very soon. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in\
      \ heaven, saying,\n“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord\n\
      \    and of his Messiah,\nand he will reign forever and ever.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on
      their faces and worshiped God, '
    17: "¹⁷ singing,\n“We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty,\n    who are and who\
      \ were,\nfor you have taken your great power\n    and begun to reign.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The nations raged,\n    but your wrath has come,\n    and the time for\
      \ judging the dead,\nfor rewarding your servants, the prophets\n    and saints\
      \ and all who fear your name,\n    both small and great,\nand for destroying\
      \ those who destroy the earth.” \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was
      seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals
      of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
  12:
    1: '¹ A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the
      moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. '
    2: '² She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs, in the agony of giving
      birth. '
    3: '³ Then another portent appeared in heaven: a great red dragon, with seven
      heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. '
    4: '⁴ His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the
      earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child,
      so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born. '
    5: '⁵ And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations
      with a rod of iron. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to
      his throne; '
    6: "⁶ and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by\
      \ God, so that there she can be nourished for one thousand two hundred sixty\
      \ days. \n"
    7: '⁷ And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.
      The dragon and his angels fought back, '
    8: '⁸ but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. '
    9: "⁹ The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the\
      \ Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the\
      \ earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,\n“Now have come the\
      \ salvation and the power\n    and the kingdom of our God\n    and the authority\
      \ of his Messiah,\nfor the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down,\n \
      \   who accuses them day and night before our God.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb\n    and by the word\
      \ of their testimony,\nfor they did not cling to life even in the face of death.\n"
    12: "¹² Rejoice then, you heavens\n    and those who dwell in them!\nBut woe to\
      \ the earth and the sea,\n    for the devil has come down to you\nwith great\
      \ wrath,\n    because he knows that his time is short!” \n"
    13: '¹³ So when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued
      the woman who had given birth to the male child. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she
      could fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished
      for a time, and times, and half a time. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then from his mouth the serpent poured water like a river after the woman,
      to sweep her away with the flood. '
    16: '¹⁶ But the earth came to the help of the woman; it opened its mouth and swallowed
      the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on\
      \ the rest of her children, those who keep the commandments of God and hold\
      \ the testimony of Jesus. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ Then the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.
  13:
    1: '¹ And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads;
      and on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names. '
    2: '² And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear’s,
      and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave it his power and
      his throne and great authority. '
    3: '³ One of its heads seemed to have received a death-blow, but its mortal wound
      had been healed. In amazement the whole earth followed the beast. '
    4: "⁴ They worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast,\
      \ and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can\
      \ fight against it?” \n"
    5: '⁵ The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and
      it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. '
    6: '⁶ It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name
      and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. '
    7: '⁷ Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. It was
      given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation, '
    8: "⁸ and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it, everyone whose name\
      \ has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life\
      \ of the Lamb that was slaughtered. \n"
    9: "⁹ Let anyone who has an ear listen: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ If you are to be taken captive,\n    into captivity you go;\nif you kill\
      \ with the sword,\n    with the sword you must be killed.\nHere is a call for\
      \ the endurance and faith of the saints. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw another beast that rose out of the earth; it had two horns
      like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. '
    12: '¹² It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it
      makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound
      had been healed. '
    13: '¹³ It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth
      in the sight of all; '
    14: '¹⁴ and by the signs that it is allowed to perform on behalf of the beast,
      it deceives the inhabitants of earth, telling them to make an image for the
      beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived; '
    15: '¹⁵ and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the
      image of the beast could even speak and cause those who would not worship the
      image of the beast to be killed. '
    16: '¹⁶ Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free
      and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, '
    17: '¹⁷ so that no one can buy or sell who does not have the mark, that is, the
      name of the beast or the number of its name. '
    18: '¹⁸ This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate the number
      of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six.'
  14:
    1: '¹ Then I looked, and there was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion! And with
      him were one hundred forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father’s name
      written on their foreheads. '
    2: '² And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the
      sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing
      on their harps, '
    3: '³ and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures
      and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the one hundred forty-four
      thousand who have been redeemed from the earth. '
    4: '⁴ It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins;
      these follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from humankind
      as first fruits for God and the Lamb, '
    5: "⁵ and in their mouth no lie was found; they are blameless. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to
      proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation and tribe and language
      and people. '
    7: "⁷ He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his\
      \ judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and\
      \ the springs of water.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then another angel, a second, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon\
      \ the great! She has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her\
      \ fornication.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then another angel, a third, followed them, crying with a loud voice, “Those
      who worship the beast and its image, and receive a mark on their foreheads or
      on their hands, '
    10: '¹⁰ they will also drink the wine of God’s wrath, poured unmixed into the
      cup of his anger, and they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence
      of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. '
    11: "¹¹ And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. There is no rest\
      \ day or night for those who worship the beast and its image and for anyone\
      \ who receives the mark of its name.” \n"
    12: "¹² Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments\
      \ of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus. \n"
    13: "¹³ And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead\
      \ who from now on die in the Lord.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest\
      \ from their labors, for their deeds follow them.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was
      one like the Son of Man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle
      in his hand! '
    15: '¹⁵ Another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to the
      one who sat on the cloud, “Use your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has
      come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the\
      \ earth was reaped. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a
      sharp sickle. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority
      over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle,
      “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for
      its grapes are ripe.” '
    19: '¹⁹ So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage
      of the earth, and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God. '
    20: ²⁰ And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from
      the wine press, as high as a horse’s bridle, for a distance of about two hundred
      miles.
  15:
    1: "¹ Then I saw another portent in heaven, great and amazing: seven angels with\
      \ seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is ended.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those
      who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing
      beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands. '
    3: "³ And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the\
      \ Lamb:\n“Great and amazing are your deeds,\n    Lord God the Almighty!\nJust\
      \ and true are your ways,\n    King of the nations!\n"
    4: "⁴ Lord, who will not fear\n    and glorify your name?\nFor you alone are holy.\n\
      \    All nations will come\n    and worship before you,\nfor your judgments\
      \ have been revealed.” \n"
    5: '⁵ After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was
      opened, '
    6: '⁶ and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed
      in pure bright linen, with golden sashes across their chests. '
    7: '⁷ Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden
      bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever; '
    8: ⁸ and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power,
      and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels
      were ended.
  16:
    1: "¹ Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, “Go\
      \ and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.” \n"
    2: "² So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth, and a foul and\
      \ painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped\
      \ its image. \n"
    3: "³ The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood\
      \ of a corpse, and every living thing in the sea died. \n"
    4: '⁴ The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water,
      and they became blood. '
    5: "⁵ And I heard the angel of the waters say,\n“You are just, O Holy One, who\
      \ are and were,\n    for you have judged these things;\n"
    6: "⁶ because they shed the blood of saints and prophets,\n    you have given\
      \ them blood to drink.\nIt is what they deserve!” \n"
    7: "⁷ And I heard the altar respond,\n“Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty,\n    your\
      \ judgments are true and just!” \n"
    8: '⁸ The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch
      people with fire; '
    9: "⁹ they were scorched by the fierce heat, but they cursed the name of God,\
      \ who had authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him\
      \ glory. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom
      was plunged into darkness; people gnawed their tongues in agony, '
    11: "¹¹ and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores, and they\
      \ did not repent of their deeds. \n"
    12: '¹² The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its
      water was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings from the east. '
    13: '¹³ And I saw three foul spirits like frogs coming from the mouth of the dragon,
      from the mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet. '
    14: '¹⁴ These are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings
      of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the
      Almighty. '
    15: '¹⁵ (“See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and
      is clothed, not going about naked and exposed to shame.”) '
    16: "¹⁶ And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Harmagedon.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came
      out of the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” '
    18: '¹⁸ And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and
      a violent earthquake, such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth,
      so violent was that earthquake. '
    19: '¹⁹ The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations
      fell. God remembered great Babylon and gave her the wine-cup of the fury of
      his wrath. '
    20: '²⁰ And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found; '
    21: ²¹ and huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, dropped from
      heaven on people, until they cursed God for the plague of the hail, so fearful
      was that plague.
  17:
    1: '¹ Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me,
      “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great whore who is seated on many
      waters, '
    2: '² with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and with the
      wine of whose fornication the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk.” '
    3: '³ So he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman
      sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven
      heads and ten horns. '
    4: '⁴ The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels
      and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities
      of her fornication; '
    5: '⁵ and on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the great, mother
      of whores and of earth’s abominations.” '
    6: "⁶ And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the\
      \ blood of the witnesses to Jesus.\nWhen I saw her, I was greatly amazed. "
    7: '⁷ But the angel said to me, “Why are you so amazed? I will tell you the mystery
      of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. '
    8: "⁸ The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from the\
      \ bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth, whose\
      \ names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the\
      \ world, will be amazed when they see the beast, because it was and is not and\
      \ is to come. \n"
    9: '⁹ “This calls for a mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains
      on which the woman is seated; also, they are seven kings, '
    10: '¹⁰ of whom five have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come;
      and when he comes, he must remain only a little while. '
    11: '¹¹ As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to
      the seven, and it goes to destruction. '
    12: '¹² And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received
      a kingdom, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together
      with the beast. '
    13: '¹³ These are united in yielding their power and authority to the beast; '
    14: "¹⁴ they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he\
      \ is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen\
      \ and faithful.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the whore is seated,
      are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the whore;
      they will make her desolate and naked; they will devour her flesh and burn her
      up with fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing
      to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled. '
    18: ¹⁸ The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
  18:
    1: '¹ After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority;
      and the earth was made bright with his splendor. '
    2: "² He called out with a mighty voice,\n“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!\n\
      \    It has become a dwelling place of demons,\na haunt of every foul spirit,\n\
      \    a haunt of every foul bird,\n    a haunt of every foul and hateful beast.\n"
    3: "³ For all the nations have drunk\n    of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,\n\
      and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,\n    and the\
      \ merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxury.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,\n“Come out of her, my people,\n\
      \    so that you do not take part in her sins,\nand so that you do not share\
      \ in her plagues;\n"
    5: "⁵ for her sins are heaped high as heaven,\n    and God has remembered her\
      \ iniquities.\n"
    6: "⁶ Render to her as she herself has rendered,\n    and repay her double for\
      \ her deeds;\n    mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed.\n"
    7: "⁷ As she glorified herself and lived luxuriously,\n    so give her a like\
      \ measure of torment and grief.\nSince in her heart she says,\n    ‘I rule as\
      \ a queen;\nI am no widow,\n    and I will never see grief,’\n"
    8: "⁸ therefore her plagues will come in a single day—\n    pestilence and mourning\
      \ and famine—\nand she will be burned with fire;\n    for mighty is the Lord\
      \ God who judges her.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived in luxury
      with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning; '
    10: "¹⁰ they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say,\n“Alas, alas,\
      \ the great city,\n    Babylon, the mighty city!\nFor in one hour your judgment\
      \ has come.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys
      their cargo anymore, '
    12: '¹² cargo of gold, silver, jewels and pearls, fine linen, purple, silk and
      scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, all articles of ivory, all articles of costly
      wood, bronze, iron, and marble, '
    13: "¹³ cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, choice\
      \ flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, slaves—and human lives.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “The fruit for which your soul longed\n    has gone from you,\nand all\
      \ your dainties and your splendor\n    are lost to you,\n    never to be found\
      \ again!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far\
      \ off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Alas, alas, the great city,\n    clothed in fine linen,\n        in purple\
      \ and scarlet,\n    adorned with gold,\n        with jewels, and with pearls!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For in one hour all this wealth has been laid waste!”\nAnd all shipmasters\
      \ and seafarers, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off "
    18: "¹⁸ and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning,\n“What city was like\
      \ the great city?” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they threw dust on their heads, as they wept and mourned, crying out,\n\
      “Alas, alas, the great city,\n    where all who had ships at sea\n    grew rich\
      \ by her wealth!\nFor in one hour she has been laid waste.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints and apostles and prophets! For\
      \ God has given judgment for you against her. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it\
      \ into the sea, saying,\n“With such violence Babylon the great city\n    will\
      \ be thrown down,\n    and will be found no more;\n"
    22: "²² and the sound of harpists and minstrels and of flutists and trumpeters\n\
      \    will be heard in you no more;\nand an artisan of any trade\n    will be\
      \ found in you no more;\nand the sound of the millstone\n    will be heard in\
      \ you no more;\n"
    23: "²³ and the light of a lamp\n    will shine in you no more;\nand the voice\
      \ of bridegroom and bride\n    will be heard in you no more;\nfor your merchants\
      \ were the magnates of the earth,\n    and all nations were deceived by your\
      \ sorcery.\n"
    24: "²⁴ And in you was found the blood of prophets and of saints,\n    and of\
      \ all who have been slaughtered on earth.”"
  19:
    1: "¹ After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude\
      \ in heaven, saying,\n“Hallelujah!\nSalvation and glory and power to our God,\n"
    2: "²     for his judgments are true and just;\nhe has judged the great whore\n\
      \    who corrupted the earth with her fornication,\nand he has avenged on her\
      \ the blood of his servants.” \n"
    3: "³ Once more they said,\n“Hallelujah!\nThe smoke goes up from her forever and\
      \ ever.” \n"
    4: "⁴ And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped\
      \ God who is seated on the throne, saying,\n“Amen. Hallelujah!” \n"
    5: "⁵ And from the throne came a voice saying,\n“Praise our God,\n    all you\
      \ his servants,\nand all who fear him,\n    small and great.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the\
      \ sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying out,\n\
      “Hallelujah!\nFor the Lord our God\n    the Almighty reigns.\n"
    7: "⁷ Let us rejoice and exult\n    and give him the glory,\nfor the marriage\
      \ of the Lamb has come,\n    and his bride has made herself ready;\n"
    8: "⁸ to her it has been granted to be clothed\n    with fine linen, bright and\
      \ pure”—\nfor the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. \n"
    9: '⁹ And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited
      to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are true words
      of God.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must\
      \ not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the\
      \ testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit\
      \ of prophecy.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse! Its rider is called
      Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. '
    12: '¹² His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and
      he has a name inscribed that no one knows but himself. '
    13: '¹³ He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word
      of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ And the armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, were following
      him on white horses. '
    15: '¹⁵ From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations,
      and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he will tread the wine press of the
      fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. '
    16: "¹⁶ On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed, “King of kings and\
      \ Lord of lords.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called
      to all the birds that fly in midheaven, “Come, gather for the great supper of
      God, '
    18: '¹⁸ to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of the mighty,
      the flesh of horses and their riders—flesh of all, both free and slave, both
      small and great.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered
      to make war against the rider on the horse and against his army. '
    20: '²⁰ And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed
      in its presence the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark
      of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive
      into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. '
    21: ²¹ And the rest were killed by the sword of the rider on the horse, the sword
      that came from his mouth; and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
  20:
    1: '¹ Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key
      to the bottomless pit and a great chain. '
    2: '² He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan,
      and bound him for a thousand years, '
    3: "³ and threw him into the pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he\
      \ would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended. After\
      \ that he must be let out for a little while. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then I saw thrones, and those seated on them were given authority to judge.
      I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus
      and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had
      not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and
      reigned with Christ a thousand years. '
    5: '⁵ (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were
      ended.) This is the first resurrection. '
    6: "⁶ Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. Over these\
      \ the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ,\
      \ and they will reign with him a thousand years. \n"
    7: '⁷ When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison '
    8: '⁸ and will come out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth,
      Gog and Magog, in order to gather them for battle; they are as numerous as the
      sands of the sea. '
    9: '⁹ They marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of
      the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from heaven and consumed
      them. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and\
      \ sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented\
      \ day and night forever and ever. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it; the earth and
      the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. '
    12: '¹² And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books
      were opened. Also another book was opened, the book of life. And the dead were
      judged according to their works, as recorded in the books. '
    13: '¹³ And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, Death and Hades gave up
      the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second
      death, the lake of fire; '
    15: ¹⁵ and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown
      into the lake of fire.
  21:
    1: '¹ Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first
      earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. '
    2: '² And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from
      God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. '
    3: "³ And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,\n“See, the home of God\
      \ is among mortals.\nHe will dwell with them;\nthey will be his peoples,\nand\
      \ God himself will be with them;\n"
    4: "⁴ he will wipe every tear from their eyes.\nDeath will be no more;\nmourning\
      \ and crying and pain will be no more,\nfor the first things have passed away.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ And the one who was seated on the throne said, “See, I am making all things
      new.” Also he said, “Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.” '
    6: '⁶ Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
      and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the
      water of life. '
    7: '⁷ Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and
      they will be my children. '
    8: "⁸ But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, the murderers, the\
      \ fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will\
      \ be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last
      plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the
      Lamb.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed
      me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God. '
    11: '¹¹ It has the glory of God and a radiance like a very rare jewel, like jasper,
      clear as crystal. '
    12: '¹² It has a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels,
      and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites; '
    13: '¹³ on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three
      gates, and on the west three gates. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve\
      \ names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the
      city and its gates and walls. '
    16: '¹⁶ The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width; and he measured
      the city with his rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height
      are equal. '
    17: '¹⁷ He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits by human measurement,
      which the angel was using. '
    18: '¹⁸ The wall is built of jasper, while the city is pure gold, clear as glass. '
    19: '¹⁹ The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every jewel;
      the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, '
    20: '²⁰ the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth
      beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth
      amethyst. '
    21: "²¹ And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each of the gates is a single\
      \ pearl, and the street of the city is pure gold, transparent as glass. \n"
    22: '²² I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty
      and the Lamb. '
    23: '²³ And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory
      of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. '
    24: '²⁴ The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring
      their glory into it. '
    25: '²⁵ Its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. '
    26: '²⁶ People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. '
    27: ²⁷ But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination
      or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal,
      flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb '
    2: '² through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river
      is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each
      month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. '
    3: '³ Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and
      of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; '
    4: '⁴ they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. '
    5: "⁵ And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for\
      \ the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true, for the Lord,\

    7: "⁷ “See, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy\
      \ of this book.” \n"
    8: '⁸ I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and
      saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to
      me; '
    9: "⁹ but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you\
      \ and your comrades the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this\
      \ book. Worship God!” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book,

    11: "¹¹ Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the\
      \ righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.” \n"
    12: '¹² “See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone’s
      work. '
    13: "¹³ I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and\
      \ the end.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right
      to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. '
    15: "¹⁵ Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters,\
      \ and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the\
      \ churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.”\nAnd let everyone who hears say,\
      \ “Come.”\nAnd let everyone who is thirsty come.\nLet anyone who wishes take\
      \ the water of life as a gift. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone
      adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book; '
    19: "¹⁹ if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God\
      \ will take away that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city,\
      \ which are described in this book. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The one who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.”\n\
      Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! \n"
    21: ²¹ The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
