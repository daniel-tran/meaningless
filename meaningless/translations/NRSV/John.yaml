John:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
      God. '
    2: '² He was in the beginning with God. '
    3: '³ All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came
      into being. What has come into being '
    4: '⁴ in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. '
    5: "⁵ The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. '
    7: '⁷ He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe
      through him. '
    8: '⁸ He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. '
    9: "⁹ The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the
      world did not know him. '
    11: '¹¹ He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. '
    12: '¹² But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to
      become children of God, '
    13: "¹³ who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will\
      \ of man, but of God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory,
      the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ (John testified to him and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He
      who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’”) '
    16: '¹⁶ From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. '
    17: '¹⁷ The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus
      Christ. '
    18: "¹⁸ No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the\
      \ Father’s heart, who has made him known. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites
      from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” '
    20: '²⁰ He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.” '
    21: '²¹ And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.”
      “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.” '
    22: '²² Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who
      sent us. What do you say about yourself?” '
    23: "²³ He said,\n“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,\n‘Make\
      \ straight the way of the Lord,’”\nas the prophet Isaiah said. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. '
    25: '²⁵ They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah,
      nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” '
    26: '²⁶ John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you
      do not know, '
    27: '²⁷ the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of
      his sandal.” '
    28: "²⁸ This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the
      Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! '
    30: '³⁰ This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me
      because he was before me.’ '
    31: '³¹ I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason,
      that he might be revealed to Israel.” '
    32: '³² And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove,
      and it remained on him. '
    33: '³³ I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water
      said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who
      baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ '
    34: "³⁴ And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”\
      \ \n"
    35: '³⁵ The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples, '
    36: '³⁶ and as he watched Jesus walk by, he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb
      of God!” '
    37: '³⁷ The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. '
    38: '³⁸ When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you
      looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where
      are you staying?” '
    39: '³⁹ He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying,
      and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon. '
    40: '⁴⁰ One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon
      Peter’s brother. '
    41: '⁴¹ He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah”
      (which is translated Anointed). '
    42: "⁴² He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon\
      \ son of John. You are to be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter). \n"
    43: '⁴³ The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said
      to him, “Follow me.” '
    44: '⁴⁴ Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom
      Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.” '
    46: '⁴⁶ Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip
      said to him, “Come and see.” '
    47: '⁴⁷ When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly
      an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” '
    48: '⁴⁸ Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I
      saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” '
    49: '⁴⁹ Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of
      Israel!” '
    50: '⁵⁰ Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under
      the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” '
    51: ⁵¹ And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened
      and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”
  2:
    1: '¹ On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother
      of Jesus was there. '
    2: '² Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. '
    3: '³ When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” '
    4: '⁴ And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My
      hour has not yet come.” '
    5: '⁵ His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” '
    6: '⁶ Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification,
      each holding twenty or thirty gallons. '
    7: '⁷ Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up
      to the brim. '
    8: '⁸ He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.”
      So they took it. '
    9: '⁹ When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know
      where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward
      called the bridegroom '
    10: '¹⁰ and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior
      wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until
      now.” '
    11: "¹¹ Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed\
      \ his glory; and his disciples believed in him. \n"
    12: "¹² After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and\
      \ his disciples; and they remained there a few days. \n"
    13: '¹³ The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. '
    14: '¹⁴ In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the
      money changers seated at their tables. '
    15: '¹⁵ Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the
      sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and
      overturned their tables. '
    16: '¹⁶ He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here!
      Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!” '
    17: '¹⁷ His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will
      consume me.” '
    18: '¹⁸ The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?” '
    19: '¹⁹ Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
      it up.” '
    20: '²⁰ The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six
      years, and will you raise it up in three days?” '
    21: '²¹ But he was speaking of the temple of his body. '
    22: "²² After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had\
      \ said this; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ When he was in Jerusalem during the Passover festival, many believed in
      his name because they saw the signs that he was doing. '
    24: '²⁴ But Jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them, because he knew
      all people '
    25: ²⁵ and needed no one to testify about anyone; for he himself knew what was
      in everyone.
  3:
    1: '¹ Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. '
    2: '² He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are
      a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart
      from the presence of God.” '
    3: '³ Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom
      of God without being born from above.” '
    4: '⁴ Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can
      one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” '
    5: '⁵ Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of
      God without being born of water and Spirit. '
    6: '⁶ What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. '
    7: '⁷ Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ '
    8: '⁸ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do
      not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is
      born of the Spirit.” '
    9: '⁹ Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” '
    10: "¹⁰ Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand\
      \ these things? \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what
      we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. '
    12: '¹² If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can
      you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? '
    13: '¹³ No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven,
      the Son of Man. '
    14: '¹⁴ And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the
      Son of Man be lifted up, '
    15: "¹⁵ that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone\
      \ who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world,
      but in order that the world might be saved through him. '
    18: '¹⁸ Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe
      are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only
      Son of God. '
    19: '¹⁹ And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and
      people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. '
    20: '²⁰ For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that
      their deeds may not be exposed. '
    21: "²¹ But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly\
      \ seen that their deeds have been done in God.” \n"
    22: '²² After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and
      he spent some time there with them and baptized. '
    23: '²³ John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was abundant
      there; and people kept coming and were being baptized '
    24: "²⁴ —John, of course, had not yet been thrown into prison. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now a discussion about purification arose between John’s disciples and
      a Jew. '
    26: '²⁶ They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across
      the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing, and all are going to
      him.” '
    27: '²⁷ John answered, “No one can receive anything except what has been given
      from heaven. '
    28: '²⁸ You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but
      I have been sent ahead of him.’ '
    29: '²⁹ He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom,
      who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. For this
      reason my joy has been fulfilled. '
    30: "³⁰ He must increase, but I must decrease.” \n"
    31: '³¹ The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is of the earth
      belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from
      heaven is above all. '
    32: '³² He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony. '
    33: '³³ Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this, that God is true. '
    34: '³⁴ He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit
      without measure. '
    35: '³⁵ The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hands. '
    36: ³⁶ Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son
      will not see life, but must endure God’s wrath.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard, “Jesus is making and
      baptizing more disciples than John” '
    2: '² —although it was not Jesus himself but his disciples who baptized— '
    3: '³ he left Judea and started back to Galilee. '
    4: '⁴ But he had to go through Samaria. '
    5: '⁵ So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that
      Jacob had given to his son Joseph. '
    6: "⁶ Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting\
      \ by the well. It was about noon. \n"
    7: '⁷ A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a
      drink.” '
    8: '⁸ (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) '
    9: '⁹ The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink
      of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) '
    10: '¹⁰ Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is
      saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have
      given you living water.” '
    11: '¹¹ The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep.
      Where do you get that living water? '
    12: '¹² Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with
      his sons and his flocks drank from it?” '
    13: '¹³ Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty
      again, '
    14: '¹⁴ but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty.
      The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up
      to eternal life.” '
    15: "¹⁵ The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be\
      \ thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” '
    17: '¹⁷ The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are
      right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; '
    18: '¹⁸ for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband.
      What you have said is true!” '
    19: '¹⁹ The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. '
    20: '²⁰ Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where
      people must worship is in Jerusalem.” '
    21: '²¹ Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will
      worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. '
    22: '²² You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation
      is from the Jews. '
    23: '²³ But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will
      worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to
      worship him. '
    24: '²⁴ God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” '
    25: '²⁵ The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called
      Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” '
    26: "²⁶ Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking
      with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking
      with her?” '
    28: '²⁸ Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said
      to the people, '
    29: '²⁹ “Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot
      be the Messiah, can he?” '
    30: "³⁰ They left the city and were on their way to him. \n"
    31: '³¹ Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” '
    32: '³² But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” '
    33: '³³ So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something
      to eat?” '
    34: '³⁴ Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and
      to complete his work. '
    35: '³⁵ Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell
      you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. '
    36: '³⁶ The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal
      life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. '
    37: '³⁷ For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ '
    38: "³⁸ I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored,\
      \ and you have entered into their labor.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s
      testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.” '
    40: '⁴⁰ So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them;
      and he stayed there two days. '
    41: '⁴¹ And many more believed because of his word. '
    42: "⁴² They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that\
      \ we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly\
      \ the Savior of the world.” \n"
    43: '⁴³ When the two days were over, he went from that place to Galilee '
    44: '⁴⁴ (for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophet’s
      own country). '
    45: "⁴⁵ When he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen\
      \ all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival; for they too had gone to\
      \ the festival. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Then he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into
      wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum. '
    47: '⁴⁷ When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged
      him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. '
    48: '⁴⁸ Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not
      believe.” '
    49: '⁴⁹ The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my little boy dies.” '
    50: '⁵⁰ Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word
      that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. '
    51: '⁵¹ As he was going down, his slaves met him and told him that his child was
      alive. '
    52: '⁵² So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they said to him,
      “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.” '
    53: '⁵³ The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him,
      “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole household. '
    54: ⁵⁴ Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to
      Galilee.
  5:
    1: "¹ After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² Now in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool, called in Hebrew Beth-zatha,
      which has five porticoes. '
    3: '³ In these lay many invalids—blind, lame, and paralyzed. '
    4: ''
    5: '⁵ One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. '
    6: '⁶ When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time,
      he said to him, “Do you want to be made well?” '
    7: '⁷ The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when
      the water is stirred up; and while I am making my way, someone else steps down
      ahead of me.” '
    8: '⁸ Jesus said to him, “Stand up, take your mat and walk.” '
    9: "⁹ At once the man was made well, and he took up his mat and began to walk.\n\
      Now that day was a sabbath. "
    10: '¹⁰ So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, “It is the sabbath; it
      is not lawful for you to carry your mat.” '
    11: '¹¹ But he answered them, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your
      mat and walk.’” '
    12: '¹² They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take it up and walk’?” '
    13: '¹³ Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had
      disappeared in the crowd that was there. '
    14: '¹⁴ Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been
      made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.” '
    15: '¹⁵ The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him
      well. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore the Jews started persecuting Jesus, because he was doing such
      things on the sabbath. '
    17: '¹⁷ But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, and I also am working.” '
    18: "¹⁸ For this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because\
      \ he was not only breaking the sabbath, but was also calling God his own Father,\
      \ thereby making himself equal to God. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing on
      his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does,
      the Son does likewise. '
    20: '²⁰ The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing; and
      he will show him greater works than these, so that you will be astonished. '
    21: '²¹ Indeed, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also
      the Son gives life to whomever he wishes. '
    22: '²² The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son, '
    23: '²³ so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who
      does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. '
    24: "²⁴ Very truly, I tell you, anyone who hears my word and believes him who\
      \ sent me has eternal life, and does not come under judgment, but has passed\
      \ from death to life. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Very truly, I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the
      dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. '
    26: '²⁶ For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son
      also to have life in himself; '
    27: '²⁷ and he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the
      Son of Man. '
    28: '²⁸ Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are
      in their graves will hear his voice '
    29: "²⁹ and will come out—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life,\
      \ and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation. \n"
    30: "³⁰ “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just,\
      \ because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me. \n"
    31: '³¹ “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. '
    32: '³² There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony
      to me is true. '
    33: '³³ You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth. '
    34: '³⁴ Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that
      you may be saved. '
    35: '³⁵ He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for
      a while in his light. '
    36: '³⁶ But I have a testimony greater than John’s. The works that the Father
      has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf
      that the Father has sent me. '
    37: '³⁷ And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have
      never heard his voice or seen his form, '
    38: "³⁸ and you do not have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe\
      \ him whom he has sent. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal
      life; and it is they that testify on my behalf. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Yet you refuse to come to me to have life. '
    41: '⁴¹ I do not accept glory from human beings. '
    42: '⁴² But I know that you do not have the love of God in you. '
    43: '⁴³ I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; if another
      comes in his own name, you will accept him. '
    44: '⁴⁴ How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not
      seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God? '
    45: '⁴⁵ Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is
      Moses, on whom you have set your hope. '
    46: '⁴⁶ If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. '
    47: ⁴⁷ But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”
  6:
    1: '¹ After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called
      the Sea of Tiberias. '
    2: '² A large crowd kept following him, because they saw the signs that he was
      doing for the sick. '
    3: '³ Jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples. '
    4: '⁴ Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near. '
    5: '⁵ When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, Jesus said to
      Philip, “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?” '
    6: '⁶ He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do. '
    7: '⁷ Philip answered him, “Six months’ wages would not buy enough bread for each
      of them to get a little.” '
    8: '⁸ One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, '
    9: '⁹ “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are
      they among so many people?” '
    10: '¹⁰ Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was a great deal of
      grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand in all. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed
      them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. '
    12: '¹² When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments
      left over, so that nothing may be lost.” '
    13: '¹³ So they gathered them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves,
      left by those who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the people saw the sign that he had done, they began to say, “This\
      \ is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force\
      \ to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, '
    17: '¹⁷ got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark,
      and Jesus had not yet come to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. '
    19: '¹⁹ When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking
      on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were terrified. '
    20: '²⁰ But he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.” '
    21: "²¹ Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached\
      \ the land toward which they were going. \n"
    22: '²² The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw
      that there had been only one boat there. They also saw that Jesus had not got
      into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. '
    23: '²³ Then some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten
      the bread after the Lord had given thanks. '
    24: "²⁴ So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there,\
      \ they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi,
      when did you come here?” '
    26: '²⁶ Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me,
      not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. '
    27: '²⁷ Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures
      for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that
      God the Father has set his seal.” '
    28: '²⁸ Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” '
    29: '²⁹ Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him
      whom he has sent.” '
    30: '³⁰ So they said to him, “What sign are you going to give us then, so that
      we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing? '
    31: '³¹ Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave
      them bread from heaven to eat.’” '
    32: '³² Then Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who
      gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread
      from heaven. '
    33: '³³ For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life
      to the world.” '
    34: "³⁴ They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.” \n"
    35: '³⁵ Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will
      never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. '
    36: '³⁶ But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. '
    37: '³⁷ Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes
      to me I will never drive away; '
    38: '³⁸ for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will
      of him who sent me. '
    39: '³⁹ And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of
      all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. '
    40: "⁴⁰ This is indeed the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe\
      \ in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, “I am the bread
      that came down from heaven.” '
    42: '⁴² They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
      and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” '
    43: '⁴³ Jesus answered them, “Do not complain among yourselves. '
    44: '⁴⁴ No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will
      raise that person up on the last day. '
    45: '⁴⁵ It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’
      Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he
      has seen the Father. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Very truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life. '
    48: '⁴⁸ I am the bread of life. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. '
    50: '⁵⁰ This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of
      it and not die. '
    51: "⁵¹ I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this\
      \ bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the\
      \ world is my flesh.” \n"
    52: '⁵² The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give
      us his flesh to eat?” '
    53: '⁵³ So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh
      of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will
      raise them up on the last day; '
    55: '⁵⁵ for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. '
    56: '⁵⁶ Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. '
    57: '⁵⁷ Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so
      whoever eats me will live because of me. '
    58: '⁵⁸ This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your
      ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.” '
    59: "⁵⁹ He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.\
      \ \n"
    60: '⁶⁰ When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This teaching is difficult;
      who can accept it?” '
    61: '⁶¹ But Jesus, being aware that his disciples were complaining about it, said
      to them, “Does this offend you? '
    62: '⁶² Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was
      before? '
    63: '⁶³ It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that
      I have spoken to you are spirit and life. '
    64: '⁶⁴ But among you there are some who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from
      the first who were the ones that did not believe, and who was the one that would
      betray him. '
    65: "⁶⁵ And he said, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to\
      \ me unless it is granted by the Father.” \n"
    66: '⁶⁶ Because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about
      with him. '
    67: '⁶⁷ So Jesus asked the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?” '
    68: '⁶⁸ Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words
      of eternal life. '
    69: '⁶⁹ We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.” '
    70: '⁷⁰ Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve? Yet one of you
      is a devil.” '
    71: ⁷¹ He was speaking of Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for he, though one of the
      twelve, was going to betray him.
  7:
    1: '¹ After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He did not wish to go about in Judea
      because the Jews were looking for an opportunity to kill him. '
    2: '² Now the Jewish festival of Booths was near. '
    3: '³ So his brothers said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples
      also may see the works you are doing; '
    4: '⁴ for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret. If you do these
      things, show yourself to the world.” '
    5: '⁵ (For not even his brothers believed in him.) '
    6: '⁶ Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. '
    7: '⁷ The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it
      that its works are evil. '
    8: '⁸ Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival, for my time
      has not yet fully come.” '
    9: "⁹ After saying this, he remained in Galilee. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not
      publicly but as it were in secret. '
    11: '¹¹ The Jews were looking for him at the festival and saying, “Where is he?” '
    12: '¹² And there was considerable complaining about him among the crowds. While
      some were saying, “He is a good man,” others were saying, “No, he is deceiving
      the crowd.” '
    13: "¹³ Yet no one would speak openly about him for fear of the Jews. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ About the middle of the festival Jesus went up into the temple and began
      to teach. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Jews were astonished at it, saying, “How does this man have such learning,
      when he has never been taught?” '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine but his who sent me. '
    17: '¹⁷ Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching
      is from God or whether I am speaking on my own. '
    18: "¹⁸ Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks\
      \ the glory of him who sent him is true, and there is nothing false in him.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are
      you looking for an opportunity to kill me?” '
    20: '²⁰ The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?” '
    21: '²¹ Jesus answered them, “I performed one work, and all of you are astonished. '
    22: '²² Moses gave you circumcision (it is, of course, not from Moses, but from
      the patriarchs), and you circumcise a man on the sabbath. '
    23: '²³ If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of
      Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I healed a man’s whole
      body on the sabbath? '
    24: "²⁴ Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is not this the man
      whom they are trying to kill? '
    26: '²⁶ And here he is, speaking openly, but they say nothing to him! Can it be
      that the authorities really know that this is the Messiah? '
    27: '²⁷ Yet we know where this man is from; but when the Messiah comes, no one
      will know where he is from.” '
    28: '²⁸ Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple, “You know me, and
      you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me
      is true, and you do not know him. '
    29: '²⁹ I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.” '
    30: '³⁰ Then they tried to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him, because his
      hour had not yet come. '
    31: "³¹ Yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying, “When the Messiah\
      \ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?” \n"
    32: '³² The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him, and the
      chief priests and Pharisees sent temple police to arrest him. '
    33: '³³ Jesus then said, “I will be with you a little while longer, and then I
      am going to him who sent me. '
    34: '³⁴ You will search for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you
      cannot come.” '
    35: '³⁵ The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we
      will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and
      teach the Greeks? '
    36: "³⁶ What does he mean by saying, ‘You will search for me and you will not\
      \ find me’ and ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?” \n"
    37: '³⁷ On the last day of the festival, the great day, while Jesus was standing
      there, he cried out, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, '
    38: '³⁸ and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, ‘Out
      of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water.’” '
    39: "³⁹ Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in him were to receive;\
      \ for as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus was not yet glorified. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ When they heard these words, some in the crowd said, “This is really the
      prophet.” '
    41: '⁴¹ Others said, “This is the Messiah.” But some asked, “Surely the Messiah
      does not come from Galilee, does he? '
    42: '⁴² Has not the scripture said that the Messiah is descended from David and
      comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?” '
    43: '⁴³ So there was a division in the crowd because of him. '
    44: "⁴⁴ Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Then the temple police went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who
      asked them, “Why did you not arrest him?” '
    46: '⁴⁶ The police answered, “Never has anyone spoken like this!” '
    47: '⁴⁷ Then the Pharisees replied, “Surely you have not been deceived too, have
      you? '
    48: '⁴⁸ Has any one of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? '
    49: '⁴⁹ But this crowd, which does not know the law—they are accursed.” '
    50: '⁵⁰ Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, asked, '
    51: '⁵¹ “Our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to
      find out what they are doing, does it?” '
    52: "⁵² They replied, “Surely you are not also from Galilee, are you? Search and\
      \ you will see that no prophet is to arise from Galilee.” \n[["
    53: ⁵³ Then each of them went home,
  8:
    1: '¹ while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. '
    2: '² Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to
      him and he sat down and began to teach them. '
    3: '³ The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery;
      and making her stand before all of them, '
    4: '⁴ they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing
      adultery. '
    5: '⁵ Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” '
    6: '⁶ They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring
      against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. '
    7: '⁷ When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,
      “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” '
    8: '⁸ And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. '
    9: '⁹ When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders;
      and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. '
    10: '¹⁰ Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no
      one condemned you?” '
    11: "¹¹ She said, “No one, sir.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go\
      \ your way, and from now on do not sin again.”]] \n"
    12: '¹² Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever
      follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” '
    13: '¹³ Then the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf;
      your testimony is not valid.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid
      because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know
      where I come from or where I am going. '
    15: '¹⁵ You judge by human standards; I judge no one. '
    16: '¹⁶ Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who
      judge, but I and the Father who sent me. '
    17: '¹⁷ In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid. '
    18: '¹⁸ I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my
      behalf.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Then they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know
      neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.” '
    20: "²⁰ He spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple,\
      \ but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. \n"
    21: '²¹ Again he said to them, “I am going away, and you will search for me, but
      you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” '
    22: '²² Then the Jews said, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means
      by saying, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” '
    23: '²³ He said to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this
      world, I am not of this world. '
    24: '²⁴ I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins
      unless you believe that I am he.” '
    25: '²⁵ They said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Why do I speak to
      you at all? '
    26: '²⁶ I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent
      me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.” '
    27: '²⁷ They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father. '
    28: '²⁸ So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will
      realize that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things
      as the Father instructed me. '
    29: '²⁹ And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always
      do what is pleasing to him.” '
    30: "³⁰ As he was saying these things, many believed in him. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you continue
      in my word, you are truly my disciples; '
    32: '³² and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” '
    33: "³³ They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have never been\
      \ slaves to anyone. What do you mean by saying, ‘You will be made free’?” \n"
    34: '³⁴ Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin
      is a slave to sin. '
    35: '³⁵ The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has
      a place there forever. '
    36: '³⁶ So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. '
    37: '³⁷ I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you look for an opportunity
      to kill me, because there is no place in you for my word. '
    38: "³⁸ I declare what I have seen in the Father’s presence; as for you, you should\
      \ do what you have heard from the Father.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you
      were Abraham’s children, you would be doing what Abraham did, '
    40: '⁴⁰ but now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that
      I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. '
    41: '⁴¹ You are indeed doing what your father does.” They said to him, “We are
      not illegitimate children; we have one father, God himself.” '
    42: '⁴² Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I
      came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own, but he sent me. '
    43: '⁴³ Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept
      my word. '
    44: '⁴⁴ You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father’s
      desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth,
      because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own
      nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. '
    45: '⁴⁵ But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. '
    46: '⁴⁶ Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe
      me? '
    47: "⁴⁷ Whoever is from God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear\
      \ them is that you are not from God.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan
      and have a demon?” '
    49: '⁴⁹ Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you
      dishonor me. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the
      judge. '
    51: '⁵¹ Very truly, I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.” '
    52: '⁵² The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died,
      and so did the prophets; yet you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word will never taste
      death.’ '
    53: '⁵³ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died.
      Who do you claim to be?” '
    54: '⁵⁴ Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father
      who glorifies me, he of whom you say, ‘He is our God,’ '
    55: '⁵⁵ though you do not know him. But I know him; if I would say that I do not
      know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and I keep his word. '
    56: '⁵⁶ Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and
      was glad.” '
    57: '⁵⁷ Then the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have
      you seen Abraham?” '
    58: '⁵⁸ Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.” '
    59: ⁵⁹ So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went
      out of the temple.
  9:
    1: '¹ As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. '
    2: '² His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that
      he was born blind?” '
    3: '³ Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind
      so that God’s works might be revealed in him. '
    4: '⁴ We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming
      when no one can work. '
    5: '⁵ As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” '
    6: '⁶ When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva
      and spread the mud on the man’s eyes, '
    7: '⁷ saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). Then
      he went and washed and came back able to see. '
    8: '⁸ The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask,
      “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?” '
    9: '⁹ Some were saying, “It is he.” Others were saying, “No, but it is someone
      like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.” '
    10: '¹⁰ But they kept asking him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” '
    11: '¹¹ He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and
      said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ Then I went and washed and received my
      sight.” '
    12: "¹² They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.” \n"
    13: '¹³ They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight.
      He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not
      observe the sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform
      such signs?” And they were divided. '
    17: "¹⁷ So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him? It was\
      \ your eyes he opened.” He said, “He is a prophet.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight
      until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight '
    19: '¹⁹ and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then
      does he now see?” '
    20: '²⁰ His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born
      blind; '
    21: '²¹ but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened
      his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” '
    22: '²² His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews
      had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be
      put out of the synagogue. '
    23: "²³ Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they
      said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” '
    25: '²⁵ He answered, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know,
      that though I was blind, now I see.” '
    26: '²⁶ They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” '
    27: '²⁷ He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen.
      Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?” '
    28: '²⁸ Then they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples
      of Moses. '
    29: '²⁹ We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know
      where he comes from.” '
    30: '³⁰ The man answered, “Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where
      he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. '
    31: '³¹ We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one
      who worships him and obeys his will. '
    32: '³² Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes
      of a person born blind. '
    33: '³³ If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” '
    34: "³⁴ They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying\
      \ to teach us?” And they drove him out. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said,
      “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” '
    36: '³⁶ He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.” '
    37: '³⁷ Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is
      he.” '
    38: '³⁸ He said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped him. '
    39: '³⁹ Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment so that those who do
      not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.” '
    40: '⁴⁰ Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, “Surely we
      are not blind, are we?” '
    41: ⁴¹ Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now
      that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.
  10:
    1: '¹ “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the
      gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. '
    2: '² The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. '
    3: '³ The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He
      calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. '
    4: '⁴ When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep
      follow him because they know his voice. '
    5: '⁵ They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they
      do not know the voice of strangers.” '
    6: "⁶ Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand\
      \ what he was saying to them. \n"
    7: '⁷ So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for
      the sheep. '
    8: '⁸ All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen
      to them. '
    9: '⁹ I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and
      go out and find pasture. '
    10: "¹⁰ The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may\
      \ have life, and have it abundantly. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the
      sheep. '
    12: '¹² The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees
      the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf snatches them
      and scatters them. '
    13: '¹³ The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep. '
    14: '¹⁴ I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, '
    15: '¹⁵ just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life
      for the sheep. '
    16: '¹⁶ I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them
      also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. '
    17: '¹⁷ For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order
      to take it up again. '
    18: "¹⁸ No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power\
      \ to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this\
      \ command from my Father.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Again the Jews were divided because of these words. '
    20: '²⁰ Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why
      listen to him?” '
    21: "²¹ Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can\
      \ a demon open the eyes of the blind?” \n"
    22: '²² At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It
      was winter, '
    23: '²³ and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. '
    24: '²⁴ So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep
      us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” '
    25: '²⁵ Jesus answered, “I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that
      I do in my Father’s name testify to me; '
    26: '²⁶ but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. '
    27: '²⁷ My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. '
    28: '²⁸ I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch
      them out of my hand. '
    29: '²⁹ What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch
      it out of the Father’s hand. '
    30: "³⁰ The Father and I are one.” \n"
    31: '³¹ The Jews took up stones again to stone him. '
    32: '³² Jesus replied, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For
      which of these are you going to stone me?” '
    33: '³³ The Jews answered, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone
      you, but for blasphemy, because you, though only a human being, are making yourself
      God.” '
    34: '³⁴ Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? '
    35: '³⁵ If those to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’—and the scripture
      cannot be annulled— '
    36: '³⁶ can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into
      the world is blaspheming because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’? '
    37: '³⁷ If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me. '
    38: '³⁸ But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works,
      so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the
      Father.” '
    39: "³⁹ Then they tried to arrest him again, but he escaped from their hands.\
      \ \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been
      baptizing earlier, and he remained there. '
    41: '⁴¹ Many came to him, and they were saying, “John performed no sign, but everything
      that John said about this man was true.” '
    42: ⁴² And many believed in him there.
  11:
    1: '¹ Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her
      sister Martha. '
    2: '² Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with
      her hair; her brother Lazarus was ill. '
    3: '³ So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” '
    4: '⁴ But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This illness does not lead to death;
      rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through
      it.” '
    5: '⁵ Accordingly, though Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, '
    6: "⁶ after having heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the\
      \ place where he was. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” '
    8: '⁸ The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone
      you, and are you going there again?” '
    9: '⁹ Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk
      during the day do not stumble, because they see the light of this world. '
    10: '¹⁰ But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.” '
    11: '¹¹ After saying this, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
      but I am going there to awaken him.” '
    12: '¹² The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be
      all right.” '
    13: '¹³ Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that
      he was referring merely to sleep. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. '
    15: '¹⁵ For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But
      let us go to him.” '
    16: "¹⁶ Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us\
      \ also go, that we may die with him.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb
      four days. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, '
    19: '¹⁹ and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about
      their brother. '
    20: '²⁰ When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary
      stayed at home. '
    21: '²¹ Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not
      have died. '
    22: '²² But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.” '
    23: '²³ Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” '
    24: '²⁴ Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection
      on the last day.” '
    25: '²⁵ Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe
      in me, even though they die, will live, '
    26: '²⁶ and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe
      this?” '
    27: "²⁷ She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son\
      \ of God, the one coming into the world.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and
      told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” '
    29: '²⁹ And when she heard it, she got up quickly and went to him. '
    30: '³⁰ Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place
      where Martha had met him. '
    31: '³¹ The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up
      quickly and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going
      to the tomb to weep there. '
    32: '³² When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and
      said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” '
    33: '³³ When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping,
      he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. '
    34: '³⁴ He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and
      see.” '
    35: '³⁵ Jesus began to weep. '
    36: '³⁶ So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” '
    37: "³⁷ But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind\
      \ man have kept this man from dying?” \n"
    38: '³⁸ Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave,
      and a stone was lying against it. '
    39: '³⁹ Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man,
      said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four
      days.” '
    40: '⁴⁰ Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would
      see the glory of God?” '
    41: '⁴¹ So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father,
      I thank you for having heard me. '
    42: '⁴² I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the
      crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.” '
    43: '⁴³ When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” '
    44: "⁴⁴ The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth,\
      \ and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let\
      \ him go.” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus
      did, believed in him. '
    46: '⁴⁶ But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he had done. '
    47: '⁴⁷ So the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the council,
      and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. '
    48: '⁴⁸ If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans
      will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.” '
    49: '⁴⁹ But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,
      “You know nothing at all! '
    50: '⁵⁰ You do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for
      the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.” '
    51: '⁵¹ He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied
      that Jesus was about to die for the nation, '
    52: '⁵² and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the dispersed children
      of God. '
    53: "⁵³ So from that day on they planned to put him to death. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Jesus therefore no longer walked about openly among the Jews, but went\
      \ from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness; and\
      \ he remained there with the disciples. \n"
    55: '⁵⁵ Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up from the country
      to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. '
    56: '⁵⁶ They were looking for Jesus and were asking one another as they stood
      in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he will not come to the festival,
      will he?” '
    57: ⁵⁷ Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who
      knew where Jesus was should let them know, so that they might arrest him.
  12:
    1: '¹ Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus,
      whom he had raised from the dead. '
    2: '² There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of
      those at the table with him. '
    3: '³ Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus’ feet,
      and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the
      perfume. '
    4: '⁴ But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray
      him), said, '
    5: '⁵ “Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given
      to the poor?” '
    6: '⁶ (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a
      thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) '
    7: '⁷ Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for
      the day of my burial. '
    8: "⁸ You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.” \n"
    9: '⁹ When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not
      only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. '
    10: '¹⁰ So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, '
    11: "¹¹ since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and\
      \ were believing in Jesus. \n"
    12: '¹² The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that
      Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. '
    13: "¹³ So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,\n\
      “Hosanna!\nBlessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord—\n    the King\
      \ of Israel!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion.\nLook, your king is coming,\n   \
      \ sitting on a donkey’s colt!” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus
      was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him
      and had been done to him. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the
      tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify. '
    18: '¹⁸ It was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the
      crowd went to meet him. '
    19: "¹⁹ The Pharisees then said to one another, “You see, you can do nothing.\
      \ Look, the world has gone after him!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. '
    21: '²¹ They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him,
      “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” '
    22: '²² Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. '
    23: '²³ Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. '
    24: '²⁴ Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and
      dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. '
    25: '²⁵ Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this
      world will keep it for eternal life. '
    26: "²⁶ Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant\
      \ be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—‘Father, save me from
      this hour’? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. '
    28: '²⁸ Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified
      it, and I will glorify it again.” '
    29: '²⁹ The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others
      said, “An angel has spoken to him.” '
    30: '³⁰ Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. '
    31: '³¹ Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be
      driven out. '
    32: '³² And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” '
    33: '³³ He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. '
    34: '³⁴ The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains
      forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this
      Son of Man?” '
    35: '³⁵ Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while
      you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in
      the darkness, you do not know where you are going. '
    36: "³⁶ While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become\
      \ children of light.”\nAfter Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them. "
    37: '³⁷ Although he had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not
      believe in him. '
    38: "³⁸ This was to fulfill the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah:\n“Lord, who\
      \ has believed our message,\n    and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”\
      \ \n"
    39: "³⁹ And so they could not believe, because Isaiah also said, \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ “He has blinded their eyes\n    and hardened their heart,\nso that they\
      \ might not look with their eyes,\n    and understand with their heart and turn—\n\
      \    and I would heal them.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him. '
    42: '⁴² Nevertheless many, even of the authorities, believed in him. But because
      of the Pharisees they did not confess it, for fear that they would be put out
      of the synagogue; '
    43: "⁴³ for they loved human glory more than the glory that comes from God. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Then Jesus cried aloud: “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but
      in him who sent me. '
    45: '⁴⁵ And whoever sees me sees him who sent me. '
    46: '⁴⁶ I have come as light into the world, so that everyone who believes in
      me should not remain in the darkness. '
    47: '⁴⁷ I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them, for I
      came not to judge the world, but to save the world. '
    48: '⁴⁸ The one who rejects me and does not receive my word has a judge; on the
      last day the word that I have spoken will serve as judge, '
    49: '⁴⁹ for I have not spoken on my own, but the Father who sent me has himself
      given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. '
    50: ⁵⁰ And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak, therefore,
      I speak just as the Father has told me.”
  13:
    1: '¹ Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come
      to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were
      in the world, he loved them to the end. '
    2: '² The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot
      to betray him. And during supper '
    3: '³ Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
      that he had come from God and was going to God, '
    4: '⁴ got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around
      himself. '
    5: '⁵ Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet
      and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. '
    6: '⁶ He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my
      feet?” '
    7: '⁷ Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will
      understand.” '
    8: '⁸ Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless
      I wash you, you have no share with me.” '
    9: '⁹ Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my
      head!” '
    10: '¹⁰ Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for
      the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” '
    11: "¹¹ For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of\
      \ you are clean.” \n"
    12: '¹² After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned
      to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? '
    13: '¹³ You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am. '
    14: '¹⁴ So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought
      to wash one another’s feet. '
    15: '¹⁵ For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done
      to you. '
    16: '¹⁶ Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor
      are messengers greater than the one who sent them. '
    17: '¹⁷ If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. '
    18: '¹⁸ I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is
      to fulfill the scripture, ‘The one who ate my bread has lifted his heel against
      me.’ '
    19: '¹⁹ I tell you this now, before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you
      may believe that I am he. '
    20: "²⁰ Very truly, I tell you, whoever receives one whom I send receives me;\
      \ and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.” \n"
    21: '²¹ After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, “Very truly,
      I tell you, one of you will betray me.” '
    22: '²² The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. '
    23: '²³ One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining next to him; '
    24: '²⁴ Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. '
    25: '²⁵ So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?” '
    26: '²⁶ Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when
      I have dipped it in the dish.” So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he
      gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. '
    27: '²⁷ After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said
      to him, “Do quickly what you are going to do.” '
    28: '²⁸ Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. '
    29: '²⁹ Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling
      him, “Buy what we need for the festival”; or, that he should give something
      to the poor. '
    30: "³⁰ So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it\
      \ was night. \n"
    31: '³¹ When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified,
      and God has been glorified in him. '
    32: '³² If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself
      and will glorify him at once. '
    33: '³³ Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for
      me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot
      come.’ '
    34: '³⁴ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have
      loved you, you also should love one another. '
    35: "³⁵ By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love\
      \ for one another.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered,
      “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterward.” '
    37: '³⁷ Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down
      my life for you.” '
    38: ³⁸ Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Very truly, I tell
      you, before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times.
  14:
    1: '¹ “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me. '
    2: '² In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so,
      would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? '
    3: '³ And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take
      you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. '
    4: '⁴ And you know the way to the place where I am going.” '
    5: '⁵ Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we
      know the way?” '
    6: '⁶ Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes
      to the Father except through me. '
    7: "⁷ If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him\
      \ and have seen him.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.” '
    9: '⁹ Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you
      still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say,
      ‘Show us the Father’? '
    10: '¹⁰ Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The
      words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells
      in me does his works. '
    11: '¹¹ Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you
      do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. '
    12: '¹² Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works
      that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going
      to the Father. '
    13: '¹³ I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified
      in the Son. '
    14: "¹⁴ If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be
      with you forever. '
    17: "¹⁷ This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it\
      \ neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you,\
      \ and he will be in you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. '
    19: '¹⁹ In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me;
      because I live, you also will live. '
    20: '²⁰ On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I
      in you. '
    21: '²¹ They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and
      those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal
      myself to them.” '
    22: '²² Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will reveal
      yourself to us, and not to the world?” '
    23: '²³ Jesus answered him, “Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father
      will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. '
    24: "²⁴ Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you\
      \ hear is not mine, but is from the Father who sent me. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I have said these things to you while I am still with you. '
    26: '²⁶ But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
      will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you. '
    27: '²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as
      the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be
      afraid. '
    28: '²⁸ You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’ If
      you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father
      is greater than I. '
    29: '²⁹ And now I have told you this before it occurs, so that when it does occur,
      you may believe. '
    30: '³⁰ I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming.
      He has no power over me; '
    31: ³¹ but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that
      I love the Father. Rise, let us be on our way.
  15:
    1: '¹ “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. '
    2: '² He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears
      fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit. '
    3: '³ You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. '
    4: '⁴ Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
      unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. '
    5: '⁵ I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them
      bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. '
    6: '⁶ Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such
      branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. '
    7: '⁷ If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish,
      and it will be done for you. '
    8: '⁸ My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. '
    9: '⁹ As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. '
    10: '¹⁰ If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have
      kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. '
    11: "¹¹ I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that\
      \ your joy may be complete. \n"
    12: '¹² “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. '
    13: '¹³ No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. '
    14: '¹⁴ You are my friends if you do what I command you. '
    15: '¹⁵ I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know
      what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made
      known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. '
    16: '¹⁶ You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear
      fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask
      him in my name. '
    17: "¹⁷ I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you. '
    19: '¹⁹ If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because
      you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world—therefore
      the world hates you. '
    20: '²⁰ Remember the word that I said to you, ‘Servants are not greater than their
      master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word,
      they will keep yours also. '
    21: '²¹ But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because
      they do not know him who sent me. '
    22: '²² If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now
      they have no excuse for their sin. '
    23: '²³ Whoever hates me hates my Father also. '
    24: '²⁴ If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would
      not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. '
    25: "²⁵ It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me\
      \ without a cause.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the
      Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. '
    27: ²⁷ You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.
  16:
    1: '¹ “I have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling. '
    2: '² They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, an hour is coming when
      those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to
      God. '
    3: '³ And they will do this because they have not known the Father or me. '
    4: "⁴ But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may\
      \ remember that I told you about them.\n“I did not say these things to you from\
      \ the beginning, because I was with you. "
    5: '⁵ But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are
      you going?’ '
    6: '⁶ But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away,
      for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will
      send him to you. '
    8: '⁸ And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness
      and judgment: '
    9: '⁹ about sin, because they do not believe in me; '
    10: '¹⁰ about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see
      me no longer; '
    11: "¹¹ about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned. \n"
    12: '¹² “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. '
    13: '¹³ When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth;
      for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will
      declare to you the things that are to come. '
    14: '¹⁴ He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to
      you. '
    15: "¹⁵ All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take\
      \ what is mine and declare it to you. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little while,
      and you will see me.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by
      saying to us, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little
      while, and you will see me’; and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?” '
    18: '¹⁸ They said, “What does he mean by this ‘a little while’? We do not know
      what he is talking about.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, “Are you discussing
      among yourselves what I meant when I said, ‘A little while, and you will no
      longer see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’? '
    20: '²⁰ Very truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice;
      you will have pain, but your pain will turn into joy. '
    21: '²¹ When a woman is in labor, she has pain, because her hour has come. But
      when her child is born, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy
      of having brought a human being into the world. '
    22: '²² So you have pain now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice,
      and no one will take your joy from you. '
    23: '²³ On that day you will ask nothing of me. Very truly, I tell you, if you
      ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. '
    24: "²⁴ Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will\
      \ receive, so that your joy may be complete. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming
      when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly of
      the Father. '
    26: '²⁶ On that day you will ask in my name. I do not say to you that I will ask
      the Father on your behalf; '
    27: '²⁷ for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed
      that I came from God. '
    28: "²⁸ I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving\
      \ the world and am going to the Father.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ His disciples said, “Yes, now you are speaking plainly, not in any figure
      of speech! '
    30: '³⁰ Now we know that you know all things, and do not need to have anyone question
      you; by this we believe that you came from God.” '
    31: '³¹ Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? '
    32: '³² The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each
      one to his home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the
      Father is with me. '
    33: ³³ I have said this to you, so that in me you may have peace. In the world
      you face persecution. But take courage; I have conquered the world!”
  17:
    1: '¹ After Jesus had spoken these words, he looked up to heaven and said, “Father,
      the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, '
    2: '² since you have given him authority over all people, to give eternal life
      to all whom you have given him. '
    3: '³ And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and
      Jesus Christ whom you have sent. '
    4: '⁴ I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. '
    5: "⁵ So now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had\
      \ in your presence before the world existed. \n"
    6: '⁶ “I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They
      were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. '
    7: '⁷ Now they know that everything you have given me is from you; '
    8: '⁸ for the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they have received
      them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you
      sent me. '
    9: '⁹ I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world, but
      on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours. '
    10: '¹⁰ All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. '
    11: '¹¹ And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I
      am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given
      me, so that they may be one, as we are one. '
    12: '¹² While I was with them, I protected them in your name that you have given
      me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the one destined to
      be lost, so that the scripture might be fulfilled. '
    13: '¹³ But now I am coming to you, and I speak these things in the world so that
      they may have my joy made complete in themselves. '
    14: '¹⁴ I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they
      do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. '
    15: '¹⁵ I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to protect
      them from the evil one. '
    16: '¹⁶ They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. '
    17: '¹⁷ Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. '
    18: '¹⁸ As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. '
    19: "¹⁹ And for their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified\
      \ in truth. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will
      believe in me through their word, '
    21: '²¹ that they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may
      they also be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. '
    22: '²² The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be
      one, as we are one, '
    23: '²³ I in them and you in me, that they may become completely one, so that
      the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have
      loved me. '
    24: "²⁴ Father, I desire that those also, whom you have given me, may be with\
      \ me where I am, to see my glory, which you have given me because you loved\
      \ me before the foundation of the world. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you; and these
      know that you have sent me. '
    26: ²⁶ I made your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love
      with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”
  18:
    1: '¹ After Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across
      the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples
      entered. '
    2: '² Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met
      there with his disciples. '
    3: '³ So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the
      chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches
      and weapons. '
    4: '⁴ Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked
      them, “Whom are you looking for?” '
    5: '⁵ They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus replied, “I am he.” Judas, who
      betrayed him, was standing with them. '
    6: '⁶ When Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they stepped back and fell to the ground. '
    7: '⁷ Again he asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus of
      Nazareth.” '
    8: '⁸ Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me,
      let these men go.” '
    9: '⁹ This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, “I did not lose a single
      one of those whom you gave me.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s slave,
      and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus. '
    11: "¹¹ Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to\
      \ drink the cup that the Father has given me?” \n"
    12: '¹² So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and
      bound him. '
    13: '¹³ First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the
      high priest that year. '
    14: "¹⁴ Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have\
      \ one person die for the people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was
      known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high
      priest, '
    16: '¹⁶ but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who
      was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate,
      and brought Peter in. '
    17: '¹⁷ The woman said to Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples,
      are you?” He said, “I am not.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was\
      \ cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also\
      \ was standing with them and warming himself. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his
      teaching. '
    20: '²⁰ Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught
      in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said
      nothing in secret. '
    21: '²¹ Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know
      what I said.” '
    22: '²² When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus
      on the face, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?” '
    23: '²³ Jesus answered, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if
      I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?” '
    24: "²⁴ Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, “You
      are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” '
    26: '²⁶ One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear
      Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” '
    27: "²⁷ Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate’s headquarters. It was early
      in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid
      ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. '
    29: '²⁹ So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against
      this man?” '
    30: '³⁰ They answered, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed
      him over to you.” '
    31: '³¹ Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your
      law.” The Jews replied, “We are not permitted to put anyone to death.” '
    32: "³² (This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of\
      \ death he was to die.) \n"
    33: '³³ Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked
      him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” '
    34: '³⁴ Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about
      me?” '
    35: '³⁵ Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests
      have handed you over to me. What have you done?” '
    36: '³⁶ Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were
      from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed
      over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.” '
    37: '³⁷ Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I
      am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify
      to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.” '
    38: "³⁸ Pilate asked him, “What is truth?”\nAfter he had said this, he went out\
      \ to the Jews again and told them, “I find no case against him. "
    39: '³⁹ But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover.
      Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” '
    40: ⁴⁰ They shouted in reply, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a
      bandit.
  19:
    1: '¹ Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. '
    2: '² And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they
      dressed him in a purple robe. '
    3: '³ They kept coming up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and striking
      him on the face. '
    4: '⁴ Pilate went out again and said to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to
      you to let you know that I find no case against him.” '
    5: '⁵ So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate
      said to them, “Here is the man!” '
    6: '⁶ When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him!
      Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find
      no case against him.” '
    7: "⁷ The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought\
      \ to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. '
    9: '⁹ He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?”
      But Jesus gave him no answer. '
    10: '¹⁰ Pilate therefore said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not
      know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?” '
    11: '¹¹ Jesus answered him, “You would have no power over me unless it had been
      given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty
      of a greater sin.” '
    12: "¹² From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If\
      \ you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims\
      \ to be a king sets himself against the emperor.” \n"
    13: '¹³ When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the
      judge’s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon.
      He said to the Jews, “Here is your King!” '
    15: '¹⁵ They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate asked
      them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king
      but the emperor.” '
    16: "¹⁶ Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.\nSo they took Jesus; "
    17: '¹⁷ and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place
      of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. '
    18: '¹⁸ There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side,
      with Jesus between them. '
    19: '¹⁹ Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read,
      “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” '
    20: '²⁰ Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus
      was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and
      in Greek. '
    21: '²¹ Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The
      King of the Jews,’ but, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’” '
    22: '²² Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.” '
    23: '²³ When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided
      them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the
      tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. '
    24: "²⁴ So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it\
      \ to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill what the scripture says,\n“They\
      \ divided my clothes among themselves,\n    and for my clothing they cast lots.”\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ And that is what the soldiers did.\nMeanwhile, standing near the cross\
      \ of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,\
      \ and Mary Magdalene. "
    26: '²⁶ When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside
      her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.” '
    27: "²⁷ Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour\
      \ the disciple took her into his own home. \n"
    28: '²⁸ After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order
      to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.” '
    29: '²⁹ A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full
      of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. '
    30: "³⁰ When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed\
      \ his head and gave up his spirit. \n"
    31: '³¹ Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies
      left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a
      day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified
      men broken and the bodies removed. '
    32: '³² Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other
      who had been crucified with him. '
    33: '³³ But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did
      not break his legs. '
    34: '³⁴ Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once
      blood and water came out. '
    35: '³⁵ (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony
      is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) '
    36: '³⁶ These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, “None
      of his bones shall be broken.” '
    37: "³⁷ And again another passage of scripture says, “They will look on the one\
      \ whom they have pierced.” \n"
    38: '³⁸ After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,
      though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him
      take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed
      his body. '
    39: '³⁹ Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing
      a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths,
      according to the burial custom of the Jews. '
    41: '⁴¹ Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the
      garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. '
    42: ⁴² And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was
      nearby, they laid Jesus there.
  20:
    1: '¹ Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
      came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. '
    2: '² So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom
      Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and
      we do not know where they have laid him.” '
    3: '³ Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. '
    4: '⁴ The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached
      the tomb first. '
    5: '⁵ He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he
      did not go in. '
    6: '⁶ Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the
      linen wrappings lying there, '
    7: '⁷ and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings
      but rolled up in a place by itself. '
    8: '⁸ Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he
      saw and believed; '
    9: '⁹ for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from
      the dead. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then the disciples returned to their homes. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to
      look into the tomb; '
    12: '¹² and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been
      lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. '
    13: '¹³ They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They
      have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” '
    14: '¹⁴ When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there,
      but she did not know that it was Jesus. '
    15: '¹⁵ Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?”
      Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried
      him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!”
      (which means Teacher). '
    17: '¹⁷ Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended
      to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my
      Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” '
    18: "¹⁸ Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”;\
      \ and she told them that he had said these things to her. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors
      of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus
      came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” '
    20: '²⁰ After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples
      rejoiced when they saw the Lord. '
    21: '²¹ Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me,
      so I send you.” '
    22: '²² When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive
      the Holy Spirit. '
    23: "²³ If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain\
      \ the sins of any, they are retained.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with
      them when Jesus came. '
    25: "²⁵ So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said\
      \ to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger\
      \ in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with
      them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said,
      “Peace be with you.” '
    27: '²⁷ Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach
      out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” '
    28: '²⁸ Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” '
    29: "²⁹ Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed\
      \ are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which
      are not written in this book. '
    31: ³¹ But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the
      Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his
      name.
  21:
    1: '¹ After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea
      of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. '
    2: '² Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael
      of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. '
    3: "³ Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will\
      \ go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught\
      \ nothing. \n"
    4: '⁴ Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not
      know that it was Jesus. '
    5: '⁵ Jesus said to them, “Children, you have no fish, have you?” They answered
      him, “No.” '
    6: '⁶ He said to them, “Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will
      find some.” So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because
      there were so many fish. '
    7: '⁷ That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon
      Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked,
      and jumped into the sea. '
    8: "⁸ But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish,\
      \ for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off. \n"
    9: '⁹ When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on
      it, and bread. '
    10: '¹⁰ Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” '
    11: '¹¹ So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish,
      a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not
      torn. '
    12: '¹² Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples
      dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with
      the fish. '
    14: "¹⁴ This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after\
      \ he was raised from the dead. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son
      of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know
      that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” '
    16: '¹⁶ A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He
      said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend
      my sheep.” '
    17: '¹⁷ He said to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter
      felt hurt because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said
      to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to
      him, “Feed my sheep. '
    18: '¹⁸ Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your
      own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch
      out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you
      where you do not wish to go.” '
    19: "¹⁹ (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify\
      \ God.) After this he said to him, “Follow me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; he
      was the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord,
      who is it that is going to betray you?” '
    21: '²¹ When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?” '
    22: '²² Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what
      is that to you? Follow me!” '
    23: "²³ So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die.\
      \ Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If it is my will\
      \ that he remain until I come, what is that to you?” \n"
    24: '²⁴ This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written
      them, and we know that his testimony is true. '
    25: ²⁵ But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them
      were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books
      that would be written.
