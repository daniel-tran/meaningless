Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Kings\
      \ Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, you peoples, all of you;\n    listen, O earth, and all that is in\
      \ it;\nand let the Lord God be a witness against you,\n    the Lord from his\
      \ holy temple.\n"
    3: "³ For lo, the Lord is coming out of his place,\n    and will come down and\
      \ tread upon the high places of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ Then the mountains will melt under him\n    and the valleys will burst open,\n\
      like wax near the fire,\n    like waters poured down a steep place.\n"
    5: "⁵ All this is for the transgression of Jacob\n    and for the sins of the\
      \ house of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\n\
      And what is the high place of Judah?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,\n    a place for\
      \ planting vineyards.\nI will pour down her stones into the valley,\n    and\
      \ uncover her foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All her images shall be beaten to pieces,\n    all her wages shall be burned\
      \ with fire,\n    and all her idols I will lay waste;\nfor as the wages of a\
      \ prostitute she gathered them,\n    and as the wages of a prostitute they shall\
      \ again be used. \n"
    8: "⁸ For this I will lament and wail;\n    I will go barefoot and naked;\nI will\
      \ make lamentation like the jackals,\n    and mourning like the ostriches.\n"
    9: "⁹ For her wound is incurable.\n    It has come to Judah;\nit has reached to\
      \ the gate of my people,\n    to Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell it not in Gath,\n    weep not at all;\nin Beth-leaphrah\n    roll\
      \ yourselves in the dust.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass on your way,\n    inhabitants of Shaphir,\n    in nakedness and shame;\n\
      the inhabitants of Zaanan\n    do not come forth;\nBeth-ezel is wailing\n  \
      \  and shall remove its support from you.\n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitants of Maroth\n    wait anxiously for good,\nyet disaster\
      \ has come down from the Lord\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ Harness the steeds to the chariots,\n    inhabitants of Lachish;\nit was\
      \ the beginning of sin\n    to daughter Zion,\nfor in you were found\n    the\
      \ transgressions of Israel.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you shall give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth-gath;\nthe houses\
      \ of Achzib shall be a deception\n    to the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will again bring a conqueror upon you,\n    inhabitants of Mareshah;\n\
      the glory of Israel\n    shall come to Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair\n    for your pampered children;\n\
      make yourselves as bald as the eagle,\n    for they have gone from you into\
      \ exile."
  2:
    1: "¹ Alas for those who devise wickedness\n    and evil deeds on their beds!\n\
      When the morning dawns, they perform it,\n    because it is in their power.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields, and seize them;\n    houses, and take them away;\nthey\
      \ oppress householder and house,\n    people and their inheritance.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore thus says the Lord:\nNow, I am devising against this family an\
      \ evil\n    from which you cannot remove your necks;\nand you shall not walk\
      \ haughtily,\n    for it will be an evil time.\n"
    4: "⁴ On that day they shall take up a taunt song against you,\n    and wail with\
      \ bitter lamentation,\nand say, “We are utterly ruined;\n    the Lord alters\
      \ the inheritance of my people;\nhow he removes it from me!\n    Among our captors\
      \ he parcels out our fields.”\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have no one to cast the line by lot\n    in the assembly\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Do not preach”—thus they preach—\n    “one should not preach of such things;\n\
      \    disgrace will not overtake us.”\n"
    7: "⁷ Should this be said, O house of Jacob?\n    Is the Lord’s patience exhausted?\n\
      \    Are these his doings?\nDo not my words do good\n    to one who walks uprightly?\n"
    8: "⁸ But you rise up against my people as an enemy;\n    you strip the robe from\
      \ the peaceful,\nfrom those who pass by trustingly\n    with no thought of war.\n"
    9: "⁹ The women of my people you drive out\n    from their pleasant houses;\n\
      from their young children you take away\n    my glory forever.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Arise and go;\n    for this is no place to rest,\nbecause of uncleanness\
      \ that destroys\n    with a grievous destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If someone were to go about uttering empty falsehoods,\n    saying, “I\
      \ will preach to you of wine and strong drink,”\n    such a one would be the\
      \ preacher for this people! \n"
    12: "¹² I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob,\n    I will gather the survivors\
      \ of Israel;\nI will set them together\n    like sheep in a fold,\nlike a flock\
      \ in its pasture;\n    it will resound with people.\n"
    13: "¹³ The one who breaks out will go up before them;\n    they will break through\
      \ and pass the gate,\n    going out by it.\nTheir king will pass on before them,\n\
      \    the Lord at their head."
  3:
    1: "¹ And I said:\nListen, you heads of Jacob\n    and rulers of the house of\
      \ Israel!\nShould you not know justice?—\n"
    2: "²     you who hate the good and love the evil,\nwho tear the skin off my people,\n\
      \    and the flesh off their bones;\n"
    3: "³ who eat the flesh of my people,\n    flay their skin off them,\nbreak their\
      \ bones in pieces,\n    and chop them up like meat in a kettle,\n    like flesh\
      \ in a caldron. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry to the Lord,\n    but he will not answer them;\nhe will\
      \ hide his face from them at that time,\n    because they have acted wickedly.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets\n    who lead my people astray,\n\
      who cry “Peace”\n    when they have something to eat,\nbut declare war against\
      \ those\n    who put nothing into their mouths.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,\n    and darkness to\
      \ you, without revelation.\nThe sun shall go down upon the prophets,\n    and\
      \ the day shall be black over them;\n"
    7: "⁷ the seers shall be disgraced,\n    and the diviners put to shame;\nthey\
      \ shall all cover their lips,\n    for there is no answer from God.\n"
    8: "⁸ But as for me, I am filled with power,\n    with the spirit of the Lord,\n\
      \    and with justice and might,\nto declare to Jacob his transgression\n  \
      \  and to Israel his sin. \n"
    9: "⁹ Hear this, you rulers of the house of Jacob\n    and chiefs of the house\
      \ of Israel,\nwho abhor justice\n    and pervert all equity,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ who build Zion with blood\n    and Jerusalem with wrong!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Its rulers give judgment for a bribe,\n    its priests teach for a price,\n\
      \    its prophets give oracles for money;\nyet they lean upon the Lord and say,\n\
      \    “Surely the Lord is with us!\n    No harm shall come upon us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore because of you\n    Zion shall be plowed as a field;\nJerusalem\
      \ shall become a heap of ruins,\n    and the mountain of the house a wooded\
      \ height."
  4:
    1: "¹ In days to come\n    the mountain of the Lord’s house\nshall be established\
      \ as the highest of the mountains,\n    and shall be raised up above the hills.\n\
      Peoples shall stream to it,\n"
    2: "²     and many nations shall come and say:\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\n    to the house of the God of Jacob;\nthat he may teach us\
      \ his ways\n    and that we may walk in his paths.”\nFor out of Zion shall go\
      \ forth instruction,\n    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    3: "³ He shall judge between many peoples,\n    and shall arbitrate between strong\
      \ nations far away;\nthey shall beat their swords into plowshares,\n    and\
      \ their spears into pruning hooks;\nnation shall not lift up sword against nation,\n\
      \    neither shall they learn war any more;\n"
    4: "⁴ but they shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees,\n\
      \    and no one shall make them afraid;\n    for the mouth of the Lord of hosts\
      \ has spoken. \n"
    5: "⁵ For all the peoples walk,\n    each in the name of its god,\nbut we will\
      \ walk in the name of the Lord our God\n    forever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ In that day, says the Lord,\n    I will assemble the lame\nand gather those\
      \ who have been driven away,\n    and those whom I have afflicted.\n"
    7: "⁷ The lame I will make the remnant,\n    and those who were cast off, a strong\
      \ nation;\nand the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion\n    now and forevermore.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And you, O tower of the flock,\n    hill of daughter Zion,\nto you it shall\
      \ come,\n    the former dominion shall come,\n    the sovereignty of daughter\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now why do you cry aloud?\n    Is there no king in you?\nHas your counselor\
      \ perished,\n    that pangs have seized you like a woman in labor?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Writhe and groan, O daughter Zion,\n    like a woman in labor;\nfor now\
      \ you shall go forth from the city\n    and camp in the open country;\n    you\
      \ shall go to Babylon.\nThere you shall be rescued,\n    there the Lord will\
      \ redeem you\n    from the hands of your enemies. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now many nations\n    are assembled against you,\nsaying, “Let her be\
      \ profaned,\n    and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”\n"
    12: "¹² But they do not know\n    the thoughts of the Lord;\nthey do not understand\
      \ his plan,\n    that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.\n"
    13: "¹³ Arise and thresh,\n    O daughter Zion,\nfor I will make your horn iron\n\
      \    and your hoofs bronze;\nyou shall beat in pieces many peoples,\n    and\
      \ shall devote their gain to the Lord,\n    their wealth to the Lord of the\
      \ whole earth."
  5:
    1: "¹ Now you are walled around with a wall;\n    siege is laid against us;\n\
      with a rod they strike the ruler of Israel\n    upon the cheek. \n"
    2: "² But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah,\n    who are one of the little clans\
      \ of Judah,\nfrom you shall come forth for me\n    one who is to rule in Israel,\n\
      whose origin is from of old,\n    from ancient days.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore he shall give them up until the time\n    when she who is in labor\
      \ has brought forth;\nthen the rest of his kindred shall return\n    to the\
      \ people of Israel.\n"
    4: "⁴ And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord,\n   \
      \ in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.\nAnd they shall live secure,\
      \ for now he shall be great\n    to the ends of the earth;\n"
    5: "⁵ and he shall be the one of peace.\n    If the Assyrians come into our land\n\
      \    and tread upon our soil,\nwe will raise against them seven shepherds\n\
      \    and eight installed as rulers.\n"
    6: "⁶ They shall rule the land of Assyria with the sword,\n    and the land of\
      \ Nimrod with the drawn sword;\nthey shall rescue us from the Assyrians\n  \
      \  if they come into our land\n    or tread within our border. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then the remnant of Jacob,\n    surrounded by many peoples,\nshall be like\
      \ dew from the Lord,\n    like showers on the grass,\nwhich do not depend upon\
      \ people\n    or wait for any mortal.\n"
    8: "⁸ And among the nations the remnant of Jacob,\n    surrounded by many peoples,\n\
      shall be like a lion among the animals of the forest,\n    like a young lion\
      \ among the flocks of sheep,\nwhich, when it goes through, treads down\n   \
      \ and tears in pieces, with no one to deliver.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries,\n    and all your enemies\
      \ shall be cut off. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ In that day, says the Lord,\n    I will cut off your horses from among\
      \ you\n    and will destroy your chariots;\n"
    11: "¹¹ and I will cut off the cities of your land\n    and throw down all your\
      \ strongholds;\n"
    12: "¹² and I will cut off sorceries from your hand,\n    and you shall have no\
      \ more soothsayers;\n"
    13: "¹³ and I will cut off your images\n    and your pillars from among you,\n\
      and you shall bow down no more\n    to the work of your hands;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ and I will uproot your sacred poles from among you\n    and destroy your\
      \ towns.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance\n    on the nations that\
      \ did not obey."
  6:
    1: "¹ Hear what the Lord says:\n    Rise, plead your case before the mountains,\n\
      \    and let the hills hear your voice.\n"
    2: "² Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the Lord,\n    and you enduring\
      \ foundations of the earth;\nfor the Lord has a controversy with his people,\n\
      \    and he will contend with Israel. \n"
    3: "³ “O my people, what have I done to you?\n    In what have I wearied you?\
      \ Answer me!\n"
    4: "⁴ For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,\n    and redeemed you from\
      \ the house of slavery;\nand I sent before you Moses,\n    Aaron, and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised,\n    what Balaam\
      \ son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\n   \
      \ that you may know the saving acts of the Lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ “With what shall I come before the Lord,\n    and bow myself before God\
      \ on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\n    with calves a\
      \ year old?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,\n    with ten thousands\
      \ of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\n    the\
      \ fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”\n"
    8: "⁸ He has told you, O mortal, what is good;\n    and what does the Lord require\
      \ of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\n    and to walk humbly with\
      \ your God? \n"
    9: "⁹ The voice of the Lord cries to the city\n    (it is sound wisdom to fear\
      \ your name):\nHear, O tribe and assembly of the city!\n"
    10: "¹⁰     Can I forget the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,\n\
      \    and the scant measure that is accursed?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Can I tolerate wicked scales\n    and a bag of dishonest weights?\n"
    12: "¹² Your wealthy are full of violence;\n    your inhabitants speak lies,\n\
      \    with tongues of deceit in their mouths.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore I have begun to strike you down,\n    making you desolate because\
      \ of your sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall eat, but not be satisfied,\n    and there shall be a gnawing\
      \ hunger within you;\nyou shall put away, but not save,\n    and what you save,\
      \ I will hand over to the sword.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall sow, but not reap;\n    you shall tread olives, but not anoint\
      \ yourselves with oil;\n    you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For you have kept the statutes of Omri\n    and all the works of the house\
      \ of Ahab,\n    and you have followed their counsels.\nTherefore I will make\
      \ you a desolation, and your inhabitants an object of hissing;\n    so you shall\
      \ bear the scorn of my people."
  7:
    1: "¹ Woe is me! For I have become like one who,\n    after the summer fruit has\
      \ been gathered,\n    after the vintage has been gleaned,\nfinds no cluster\
      \ to eat;\n    there is no first-ripe fig for which I hunger.\n"
    2: "² The faithful have disappeared from the land,\n    and there is no one left\
      \ who is upright;\nthey all lie in wait for blood,\n    and they hunt each other\
      \ with nets.\n"
    3: "³ Their hands are skilled to do evil;\n    the official and the judge ask\
      \ for a bribe,\nand the powerful dictate what they desire;\n    thus they pervert\
      \ justice.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a brier,\n    the most upright of them a thorn\
      \ hedge.\nThe day of their sentinels, of their punishment, has come;\n    now\
      \ their confusion is at hand.\n"
    5: "⁵ Put no trust in a friend,\n    have no confidence in a loved one;\nguard\
      \ the doors of your mouth\n    from her who lies in your embrace;\n"
    6: "⁶ for the son treats the father with contempt,\n    the daughter rises up\
      \ against her mother,\nthe daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;\n    your\
      \ enemies are members of your own household.\n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I will look to the Lord,\n    I will wait for the God of\
      \ my salvation;\n    my God will hear me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy;\n    when I fall, I shall rise;\nwhen\
      \ I sit in darkness,\n    the Lord will be a light to me.\n"
    9: "⁹ I must bear the indignation of the Lord,\n    because I have sinned against\
      \ him,\nuntil he takes my side\n    and executes judgment for me.\nHe will bring\
      \ me out to the light;\n    I shall see his vindication.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then my enemy will see,\n    and shame will cover her who said to me,\n\
      \    “Where is the Lord your God?”\nMy eyes will see her downfall;\n    now\
      \ she will be trodden down\n    like the mire of the streets. \n"
    11: "¹¹ A day for the building of your walls!\n    In that day the boundary shall\
      \ be far extended.\n"
    12: "¹² In that day they will come to you\n    from Assyria to Egypt,\nand from\
      \ Egypt to the River,\n    from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ But the earth will be desolate\n    because of its inhabitants,\n    for\
      \ the fruit of their doings. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd your people with your staff,\n    the flock that belongs to you,\n\
      which lives alone in a forest\n    in the midst of a garden land;\nlet them\
      \ feed in Bashan and Gilead\n    as in the days of old.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,\n    show us marvelous\
      \ things.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nations shall see and be ashamed\n    of all their might;\nthey shall\
      \ lay their hands on their mouths;\n    their ears shall be deaf;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ they shall lick dust like a snake,\n    like the crawling things of the\
      \ earth;\nthey shall come trembling out of their fortresses;\n    they shall\
      \ turn in dread to the Lord our God,\n    and they shall stand in fear of you.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity\n    and passing over the transgression\n\
      \    of the remnant of your possession?\nHe does not retain his anger forever,\n\
      \    because he delights in showing clemency.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will again have compassion upon us;\n    he will tread our iniquities\
      \ under foot.\nYou will cast all our sins\n    into the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will show faithfulness to Jacob\n    and unswerving loyalty to Abraham,\n\
      as you have sworn to our ancestors\n    from the days of old."
