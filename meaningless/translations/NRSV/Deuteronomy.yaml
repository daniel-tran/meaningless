Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan—in
      the wilderness, on the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban,
      Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. '
    2: '² (By the way of Mount Seir it takes eleven days to reach Kadesh-barnea from
      Horeb.) '
    3: '³ In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke
      to the Israelites just as the Lord had commanded him to speak to them. '
    4: '⁴ This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in
      Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. '
    5: "⁵ Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law\
      \ as follows: \n"
    6: '⁶ The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, “You have stayed long enough
      at this mountain. '
    7: '⁷ Resume your journey, and go into the hill country of the Amorites as well
      as into the neighboring regions—the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah,
      the Negeb, and the seacoast—the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, as far
      as the great river, the river Euphrates. '
    8: "⁸ See, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land\
      \ that I swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give\
      \ to them and to their descendants after them.” \n"
    9: '⁹ At that time I said to you, “I am unable by myself to bear you. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous
      as the stars of heaven. '
    11: '¹¹ May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times
      more and bless you, as he has promised you! '
    12: '¹² But how can I bear the heavy burden of your disputes all by myself? '
    13: '¹³ Choose for each of your tribes individuals who are wise, discerning, and
      reputable to be your leaders.” '
    14: '¹⁴ You answered me, “The plan you have proposed is a good one.” '
    15: '¹⁵ So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and reputable individuals,
      and installed them as leaders over you, commanders of thousands, commanders
      of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officials, throughout
      your tribes. '
    16: '¹⁶ I charged your judges at that time: “Give the members of your community
      a fair hearing, and judge rightly between one person and another, whether citizen
      or resident alien. '
    17: '¹⁷ You must not be partial in judging: hear out the small and the great alike;
      you shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God’s. Any case
      that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.” '
    18: "¹⁸ So I charged you at that time with all the things that you should do.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then, just as the Lord our God had ordered us, we set out from Horeb and
      went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on the way
      to the hill country of the Amorites, until we reached Kadesh-barnea. '
    20: '²⁰ I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which
      the Lord our God is giving us. '
    21: "²¹ See, the Lord your God has given the land to you; go up, take possession,\
      \ as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you; do not fear or be\
      \ dismayed.” \n"
    22: '²² All of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to explore
      the land for us and bring back a report to us regarding the route by which we
      should go up and the cities we will come to.” '
    23: '²³ The plan seemed good to me, and I selected twelve of you, one from each
      tribe. '
    24: '²⁴ They set out and went up into the hill country, and when they reached
      the Valley of Eshcol they spied it out '
    25: "²⁵ and gathered some of the land’s produce, which they brought down to us.\
      \ They brought back a report to us, and said, “It is a good land that the Lord\
      \ our God is giving us.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ But you were unwilling to go up. You rebelled against the command of the
      Lord your God; '
    27: '²⁷ you grumbled in your tents and said, “It is because the Lord hates us
      that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites
      to destroy us. '
    28: '²⁸ Where are we headed? Our kindred have made our hearts melt by reporting,
      ‘The people are stronger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified
      up to heaven! We actually saw there the offspring of the Anakim!’” '
    29: '²⁹ I said to you, “Have no dread or fear of them. '
    30: '³⁰ The Lord your God, who goes before you, is the one who will fight for
      you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your very eyes, '
    31: '³¹ and in the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you,
      just as one carries a child, all the way that you traveled until you reached
      this place. '
    32: '³² But in spite of this, you have no trust in the Lord your God, '
    33: "³³ who goes before you on the way to seek out a place for you to camp, in\
      \ fire by night, and in the cloud by day, to show you the route you should take.”\
      \ \n"
    34: '³⁴ When the Lord heard your words, he was wrathful and swore: '
    35: '³⁵ “Not one of these—not one of this evil generation—shall see the good land
      that I swore to give to your ancestors, '
    36: '³⁶ except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his
      descendants I will give the land on which he set foot, because of his complete
      fidelity to the Lord.” '
    37: '³⁷ Even with me the Lord was angry on your account, saying, “You also shall
      not enter there. '
    38: '³⁸ Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, shall enter there; encourage him, for
      he is the one who will secure Israel’s possession of it. '
    39: '³⁹ And as for your little ones, who you thought would become booty, your
      children, who today do not yet know right from wrong, they shall enter there;
      to them I will give it, and they shall take possession of it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, journey back into the wilderness, in the direction of\
      \ the Red Sea.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ You answered me, “We have sinned against the Lord! We are ready to go
      up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.” So all of you strapped
      on your battle gear, and thought it easy to go up into the hill country. '
    42: '⁴² The Lord said to me, “Say to them, ‘Do not go up and do not fight, for
      I am not in the midst of you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.’” '
    43: '⁴³ Although I told you, you would not listen. You rebelled against the command
      of the Lord and presumptuously went up into the hill country. '
    44: '⁴⁴ The Amorites who lived in that hill country then came out against you
      and chased you as bees do. They beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. '
    45: "⁴⁵ When you returned and wept before the Lord, the Lord would neither heed\
      \ your voice nor pay you any attention. \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ After you had stayed at Kadesh as many days as you did,
  2:
    1: '¹ we journeyed back into the wilderness, in the direction of the Red Sea,
      as the Lord had told me and skirted Mount Seir for many days. '
    2: '² Then the Lord said to me: '
    3: '³ “You have been skirting this hill country long enough. Head north, '
    4: '⁴ and charge the people as follows: You are about to pass through the territory
      of your kindred, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid
      of you, so, be very careful '
    5: '⁵ not to engage in battle with them, for I will not give you even so much
      as a foot’s length of their land, since I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a
      possession. '
    6: '⁶ You shall purchase food from them for money, so that you may eat; and you
      shall also buy water from them for money, so that you may drink. '
    7: '⁷ Surely the Lord your God has blessed you in all your undertakings; he knows
      your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God
      has been with you; you have lacked nothing.” '
    8: "⁸ So we passed by our kin, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, leaving\
      \ behind the route of the Arabah, and leaving behind Elath and Ezion-geber.\n\
      When we had headed out along the route of the wilderness of Moab, "
    9: '⁹ the Lord said to me: “Do not harass Moab or engage them in battle, for I
      will not give you any of its land as a possession, since I have given Ar as
      a possession to the descendants of Lot.” '
    10: '¹⁰ (The Emim—a large and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim—had formerly
      inhabited it. '
    11: '¹¹ Like the Anakim, they are usually reckoned as Rephaim, though the Moabites
      call them Emim. '
    12: '¹² Moreover, the Horim had formerly inhabited Seir, but the descendants of
      Esau dispossessed them, destroying them and settling in their place, as Israel
      has done in the land that the Lord gave them as a possession.) '
    13: "¹³ “Now then, proceed to cross over the Wadi Zered.”\nSo we crossed over\
      \ the Wadi Zered. "
    14: '¹⁴ And the length of time we had traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed
      the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of warriors
      had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn concerning them. '
    15: "¹⁵ Indeed, the Lord’s own hand was against them, to root them out from the\
      \ camp, until all had perished. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Just as soon as all the warriors had died off from among the people, '
    17: '¹⁷ the Lord spoke to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Today you are going to cross the boundary of Moab at Ar. '
    19: '¹⁹ When you approach the frontier of the Ammonites, do not harass them or
      engage them in battle, for I will not give the land of the Ammonites to you
      as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot.” '
    20: '²⁰ (It also is usually reckoned as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly inhabited
      it, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, '
    21: '²¹ a strong and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed
      them from before the Ammonites so that they could dispossess them and settle
      in their place. '
    22: '²² He did the same for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by destroying
      the Horim before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their
      place even to this day. '
    23: '²³ As for the Avvim, who had lived in settlements in the vicinity of Gaza,
      the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.) '
    24: '²⁴ “Proceed on your journey and cross the Wadi Arnon. See, I have handed
      over to you King Sihon the Amorite of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession
      by engaging him in battle. '
    25: "²⁵ This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples\
      \ everywhere under heaven; when they hear report of you, they will tremble and\
      \ be in anguish because of you.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of
      Heshbon with the following terms of peace: '
    27: '²⁷ “If you let me pass through your land, I will travel only along the road;
      I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall sell me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water
      for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot— '
    29: '²⁹ just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir have done for me and
      likewise the Moabites who live in Ar—until I cross the Jordan into the land
      that the Lord our God is giving us.” '
    30: "³⁰ But King Sihon of Heshbon was not willing to let us pass through, for\
      \ the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart defiant in order\
      \ to hand him over to you, as he has now done. \n"
    31: '³¹ The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over
      to you. Begin now to take possession of his land.” '
    32: '³² So when Sihon came out against us, he and all his people for battle at
      Jahaz, '
    33: '³³ the Lord our God gave him over to us; and we struck him down, along with
      his offspring and all his people. '
    34: '³⁴ At that time we captured all his towns, and in each town we utterly destroyed
      men, women, and children. We left not a single survivor. '
    35: '³⁵ Only the livestock we kept as spoil for ourselves, as well as the plunder
      of the towns that we had captured. '
    36: '³⁶ From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon (including the town that is in
      the wadi itself) as far as Gilead, there was no citadel too high for us. The
      Lord our God gave everything to us. '
    37: ³⁷ You did not encroach, however, on the land of the Ammonites, avoiding the
      whole upper region of the Wadi Jabbok as well as the towns of the hill country,
      just as the Lord our God had charged.
  3:
    1: '¹ When we headed up the road to Bashan, King Og of Bashan came out against
      us, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei. '
    2: '² The Lord said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you,
      along with his people and his land. Do to him as you did to King Sihon of the
      Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” '
    3: '³ So the Lord our God also handed over to us King Og of Bashan and all his
      people. We struck him down until not a single survivor was left. '
    4: '⁴ At that time we captured all his towns; there was no citadel that we did
      not take from them—sixty towns, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og
      in Bashan. '
    5: '⁵ All these were fortress towns with high walls, double gates, and bars, besides
      a great many villages. '
    6: '⁶ And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon,
      in each city utterly destroying men, women, and children. '
    7: "⁷ But all the livestock and the plunder of the towns we kept as spoil for\
      \ ourselves. \n"
    8: '⁸ So at that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land beyond
      the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon '
    9: '⁹ (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir), '
    10: '¹⁰ all the towns of the tableland, the whole of Gilead, and all of Bashan,
      as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. '
    11: '¹¹ (Now only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. In
      fact his bed, an iron bed, can still be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites. By
      the common cubit it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide.) '
    12: '¹² As for the land that we took possession of at that time, I gave to the
      Reubenites and Gadites the territory north of Aroer, that is on the edge of
      the Wadi Arnon, as well as half the hill country of Gilead with its towns, '
    13: '¹³ and I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all of
      Bashan, Og’s kingdom. (The whole region of Argob: all that portion of Bashan
      used to be called a land of Rephaim; '
    14: '¹⁴ Jair the Manassite acquired the whole region of Argob as far as the border
      of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he named them—that is, Bashan—after
      himself, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) '
    15: '¹⁵ To Machir I gave Gilead. '
    16: '¹⁶ And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead
      as far as the Wadi Arnon, with the middle of the wadi as a boundary, and up
      to the Jabbok, the wadi being boundary of the Ammonites; '
    17: "¹⁷ the Arabah also, with the Jordan and its banks, from Chinnereth down to\
      \ the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, with the lower slopes of Pisgah on the\
      \ east. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ At that time, I charged you as follows: “Although the Lord your God has
      given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the
      vanguard of your Israelite kin. '
    19: '¹⁹ Only your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have
      much livestock—shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you. '
    20: '²⁰ When the Lord gives rest to your kindred, as to you, and they too have
      occupied the land that the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan, then
      each of you may return to the property that I have given to you.” '
    21: '²¹ And I charged Joshua as well at that time, saying: “Your own eyes have
      seen everything that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; so the Lord
      will do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross. '
    22: "²² Do not fear them, for it is the Lord your God who fights for you.” \n"
    23: '²³ At that time, too, I entreated the Lord, saying: '
    24: '²⁴ “O Lord God, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and
      your might; what god in heaven or on earth can perform deeds and mighty acts
      like yours! '
    25: '²⁵ Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill
      country and the Lebanon.” '
    26: '²⁶ But the Lord was angry with me on your account and would not heed me.
      The Lord said to me, “Enough from you! Never speak to me of this matter again! '
    27: '²⁷ Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you to the west, to the north,
      to the south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross over this
      Jordan. '
    28: '²⁸ But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because it is he
      who shall cross over at the head of this people and who shall secure their possession
      of the land that you will see.” '
    29: ²⁹ So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ So now, Israel, give heed to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching
      you to observe, so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the Lord,
      the God of your ancestors, is giving you. '
    2: '² You must neither add anything to what I command you nor take away anything
      from it, but keep the commandments of the Lord your God with which I am charging
      you. '
    3: '³ You have seen for yourselves what the Lord did with regard to the Baal of
      Peor—how the Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the
      Baal of Peor, '
    4: "⁴ while those of you who held fast to the Lord your God are all alive today.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ See, just as the Lord my God has charged me, I now teach you statutes and
      ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy. '
    6: '⁶ You must observe them diligently, for this will show your wisdom and discernment
      to the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, “Surely this
      great nation is a wise and discerning people!” '
    7: '⁷ For what other great nation has a god so near to it as the Lord our God
      is whenever we call to him? '
    8: "⁸ And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this\
      \ entire law that I am setting before you today? \n"
    9: '⁹ But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the
      things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the
      days of your life; make them known to your children and your children’s children— '
    10: '¹⁰ how you once stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the Lord said
      to me, “Assemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that
      they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their
      children so”; '
    11: '¹¹ you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain
      was blazing up to the very heavens, shrouded in dark clouds. '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words
      but saw no form; there was only a voice. '
    13: '¹³ He declared to you his covenant, which he charged you to observe, that
      is, the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two stone tablets. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord charged me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances\
      \ for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Since you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire,
      take care and watch yourselves closely, '
    16: '¹⁶ so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in
      the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female, '
    17: '¹⁷ the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged
      bird that flies in the air, '
    18: '¹⁸ the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any
      fish that is in the water under the earth. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the
      stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and
      serve them, things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere
      under heaven. '
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out\
      \ of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now. \n"
    21: '²¹ The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should
      not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the Lord
      your God is giving for your possession. '
    22: '²² For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but
      you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land. '
    23: '²³ So be careful not to forget the covenant that the Lord your God made with
      you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the
      Lord your God has forbidden you. '
    24: "²⁴ For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ When you have had children and children’s children, and become complacent
      in the land, if you act corruptly by making an idol in the form of anything,
      thus doing what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and provoking him
      to anger, '
    26: '²⁶ I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will soon
      utterly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to occupy; you
      will not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ The Lord will scatter you among the peoples; only a few of you will be
      left among the nations where the Lord will lead you. '
    28: '²⁸ There you will serve other gods made by human hands, objects of wood and
      stone that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. '
    29: '²⁹ From there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find him if you
      search after him with all your heart and soul. '
    30: '³⁰ In your distress, when all these things have happened to you in time to
      come, you will return to the Lord your God and heed him. '
    31: "³¹ Because the Lord your God is a merciful God, he will neither abandon you\
      \ nor destroy you; he will not forget the covenant with your ancestors that\
      \ he swore to them. \n"
    32: '³² For ask now about former ages, long before your own, ever since the day
      that God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of heaven to the
      other: has anything so great as this ever happened or has its like ever been
      heard of? '
    33: '³³ Has any people ever heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as
      you have heard, and lived? '
    34: '³⁴ Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from
      the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty
      hand and an outstretched arm, and by terrifying displays of power, as the Lord
      your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? '
    35: '³⁵ To you it was shown so that you would acknowledge that the Lord is God;
      there is no other besides him. '
    36: '³⁶ From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he
      showed you his great fire, while you heard his words coming out of the fire. '
    37: '³⁷ And because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after
      them. He brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power, '
    38: '³⁸ driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to
      bring you in, giving you their land for a possession, as it is still today. '
    39: '³⁹ So acknowledge today and take to heart that the Lord is God in heaven
      above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Keep his statutes and his commandments, which I am commanding you today\
      \ for your own well-being and that of your descendants after you, so that you\
      \ may long remain in the land that the Lord your God is giving you for all time.\
      \ \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set apart on the east side of the Jordan three cities '
    42: '⁴² to which a homicide could flee, someone who unintentionally kills another
      person, the two not having been at enmity before; the homicide could flee to
      one of these cities and live: '
    43: "⁴³ Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland belonging to the Reubenites,\
      \ Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan belonging to\
      \ the Manassites. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites. '
    45: '⁴⁵ These are the decrees and the statutes and ordinances that Moses spoke
      to the Israelites when they had come out of Egypt, '
    46: '⁴⁶ beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of King
      Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites
      defeated when they came out of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings
      of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan: '
    48: '⁴⁸ from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion
      (that is, Hermon), '
    49: ⁴⁹ together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the
      Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
  5:
    1: "¹ Moses convened all Israel, and said to them:\nHear, O Israel, the statutes\
      \ and ordinances that I am addressing to you today; you shall learn them and\
      \ observe them diligently. "
    2: '² The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. '
    3: '³ Not with our ancestors did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, who
      are all of us here alive today. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the fire. '
    5: "⁵ (At that time I was standing between the Lord and you to declare to you\
      \ the words of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not\
      \ go up the mountain.) And he said: \n"
    6: '⁶ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of
      the house of slavery; '
    7: "⁷ you shall have no other gods before me. \n"
    8: '⁸ You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything
      that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the
      water under the earth. '
    9: '⁹ You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God
      am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third
      and fourth generation of those who reject me, '
    10: "¹⁰ but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love\
      \ me and keep my commandments. \n"
    11: "¹¹ You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for\
      \ the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name. \n"
    12: '¹² Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded
      you. '
    13: '¹³ Six days you shall labor and do all your work. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do
      any work—you, or your son or your daughter, or your male or female slave, or
      your ox or your donkey, or any of your livestock, or the resident alien in your
      towns, so that your male and female slave may rest as well as you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your\
      \ God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm;\
      \ therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you,\
      \ so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land\
      \ that the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You shall not murder. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither shall you commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Neither shall you steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ Neither shall you covet your neighbor’s wife.\nNeither shall you desire\
      \ your neighbor’s house, or field, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey,\
      \ or anything that belongs to your neighbor. \n"
    22: '²² These words the Lord spoke with a loud voice to your whole assembly at
      the mountain, out of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, and he added
      no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me. '
    23: '²³ When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was burning
      with fire, you approached me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders; '
    24: '²⁴ and you said, “Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness,
      and we have heard his voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that God may
      speak to someone and the person may still live. '
    25: '²⁵ So now why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear
      the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die. '
    26: '²⁶ For who is there of all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God
      speaking out of fire, as we have, and remained alive? '
    27: "²⁷ Go near, you yourself, and hear all that the Lord our God will say. Then\
      \ tell us everything that the Lord our God tells you, and we will listen and\
      \ do it.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ The Lord heard your words when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me:
      “I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you; they
      are right in all that they have spoken. '
    29: '²⁹ If only they had such a mind as this, to fear me and to keep all my commandments
      always, so that it might go well with them and with their children forever! '
    30: '³⁰ Go say to them, ‘Return to your tents.’ '
    31: '³¹ But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, the
      statutes and the ordinances, that you shall teach them, so that they may do
      them in the land that I am giving them to possess.” '
    32: '³² You must therefore be careful to do as the Lord your God has commanded
      you; you shall not turn to the right or to the left. '
    33: ³³ You must follow exactly the path that the Lord your God has commanded you,
      so that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live
      long in the land that you are to possess.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the ordinances—that the Lord
      your God charged me to teach you to observe in the land that you are about to
      cross into and occupy, '
    2: '² so that you and your children and your children’s children may fear the
      Lord your God all the days of your life, and keep all his decrees and his commandments
      that I am commanding you, so that your days may be long. '
    3: "³ Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe them diligently, so that it may go\
      \ well with you, and so that you may multiply greatly in a land flowing with\
      \ milk and honey, as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. '
    5: '⁵ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your
      soul, and with all your might. '
    6: '⁶ Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. '
    7: '⁷ Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and
      when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise. '
    8: '⁸ Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead, '
    9: "⁹ and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the Lord your God has brought you into the land that he swore to
      your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you—a land with
      fine, large cities that you did not build, '
    11: '¹¹ houses filled with all sorts of goods that you did not fill, hewn cisterns
      that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and
      when you have eaten your fill, '
    12: '¹² take care that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of the
      land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. '
    13: '¹³ The Lord your God you shall fear; him you shall serve, and by his name
      alone you shall swear. '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who are all around
      you, '
    15: "¹⁵ because the Lord your God, who is present with you, is a jealous God.\
      \ The anger of the Lord your God would be kindled against you and he would destroy\
      \ you from the face of the earth. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Do not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ You must diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and his
      decrees, and his statutes that he has commanded you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, so that it may go
      well with you, and so that you may go in and occupy the good land that the Lord
      swore to your ancestors to give you, '
    19: "¹⁹ thrusting out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has promised.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ When your children ask you in time to come, “What is the meaning of the
      decrees and the statutes and the ordinances that the Lord our God has commanded
      you?” '
    21: '²¹ then you shall say to your children, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt,
      but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    22: '²² The Lord displayed before our eyes great and awesome signs and wonders
      against Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his household. '
    23: '²³ He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land
      that he promised on oath to our ancestors. '
    24: '²⁴ Then the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the
      Lord our God, for our lasting good, so as to keep us alive, as is now the case. '
    25: ²⁵ If we diligently observe this entire commandment before the Lord our God,
      as he has commanded us, we will be in the right.”
  7:
    1: '¹ When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are about to enter
      and occupy, and he clears away many nations before you—the Hittites, the Girgashites,
      the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
      seven nations mightier and more numerous than you— '
    2: '² and when the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then
      you must utterly destroy them. Make no covenant with them and show them no mercy. '
    3: '³ Do not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking
      their daughters for your sons, '
    4: '⁴ for that would turn away your children from following me, to serve other
      gods. Then the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would
      destroy you quickly. '
    5: '⁵ But this is how you must deal with them: break down their altars, smash
      their pillars, hew down their sacred poles, and burn their idols with fire. '
    6: "⁶ For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen\
      \ you out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ It was not because you were more numerous than any other people that the
      Lord set his heart on you and chose you—for you were the fewest of all peoples. '
    8: '⁸ It was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath that he swore to your
      ancestors, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed
      you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who maintains
      covenant loyalty with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand
      generations, '
    10: '¹⁰ and who repays in their own person those who reject him. He does not delay
      but repays in their own person those who reject him. '
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, observe diligently the commandment—the statutes and the ordinances—that\
      \ I am commanding you today. \n"
    12: '¹² If you heed these ordinances, by diligently observing them, the Lord your
      God will maintain with you the covenant loyalty that he swore to your ancestors; '
    13: '¹³ he will love you, bless you, and multiply you; he will bless the fruit
      of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your
      oil, the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock, in the land that
      he swore to your ancestors to give you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall be the most blessed of peoples, with neither sterility nor barrenness
      among you or your livestock. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord will turn away from you every illness; all the dread diseases
      of Egypt that you experienced, he will not inflict on you, but he will lay them
      on all who hate you. '
    16: "¹⁶ You shall devour all the peoples that the Lord your God is giving over\
      \ to you, showing them no pity; you shall not serve their gods, for that would\
      \ be a snare to you. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ If you say to yourself, “These nations are more numerous than I; how can
      I dispossess them?” '
    18: '¹⁸ do not be afraid of them. Just remember what the Lord your God did to
      Pharaoh and to all Egypt, '
    19: '¹⁹ the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs and wonders, the mighty
      hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. The
      Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. '
    20: '²⁰ Moreover, the Lord your God will send the pestilence against them, until
      even the survivors and the fugitives are destroyed. '
    21: '²¹ Have no dread of them, for the Lord your God, who is present with you,
      is a great and awesome God. '
    22: '²² The Lord your God will clear away these nations before you little by little;
      you will not be able to make a quick end of them, otherwise the wild animals
      would become too numerous for you. '
    23: '²³ But the Lord your God will give them over to you, and throw them into
      great panic, until they are destroyed. '
    24: '²⁴ He will hand their kings over to you and you shall blot out their name
      from under heaven; no one will be able to stand against you, until you have
      destroyed them. '
    25: '²⁵ The images of their gods you shall burn with fire. Do not covet the silver
      or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself, because you could be ensnared
      by it; for it is abhorrent to the Lord your God. '
    26: ²⁶ Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart
      for destruction like it. You must utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set
      apart for destruction.
  8:
    1: '¹ This entire commandment that I command you today you must diligently observe,
      so that you may live and increase, and go in and occupy the land that the Lord
      promised on oath to your ancestors. '
    2: '² Remember the long way that the Lord your God has led you these forty years
      in the wilderness, in order to humble you, testing you to know what was in your
      heart, whether or not you would keep his commandments. '
    3: '³ He humbled you by letting you hunger, then by feeding you with manna, with
      which neither you nor your ancestors were acquainted, in order to make you understand
      that one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the
      mouth of the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ The clothes on your back did not wear out and your feet did not swell these
      forty years. '
    5: '⁵ Know then in your heart that as a parent disciplines a child so the Lord
      your God disciplines you. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore keep the commandments of the Lord your God, by walking in his
      ways and by fearing him. '
    7: '⁷ For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with flowing
      streams, with springs and underground waters welling up in valleys and hills, '
    8: '⁸ a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land
      of olive trees and honey, '
    9: '⁹ a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing,
      a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper. '
    10: "¹⁰ You shall eat your fill and bless the Lord your God for the good land\
      \ that he has given you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Take care that you do not forget the Lord your God, by failing to keep
      his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you
      today. '
    12: '¹² When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them, '
    13: '¹³ and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold
      is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, '
    14: '¹⁴ then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who brought
      you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, '
    15: '¹⁵ who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland
      with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock, '
    16: '¹⁶ and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know,
      to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not say to yourself, “My power and the might of my own hand have gotten
      me this wealth.” '
    18: '¹⁸ But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get
      wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors,
      as he is doing today. '
    19: '¹⁹ If you do forget the Lord your God and follow other gods to serve and
      worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish. '
    20: ²⁰ Like the nations that the Lord is destroying before you, so shall you perish,
      because you would not obey the voice of the Lord your God.
  9:
    1: '¹ Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan today, to go in and dispossess
      nations larger and mightier than you, great cities, fortified to the heavens, '
    2: '² a strong and tall people, the offspring of the Anakim, whom you know. You
      have heard it said of them, “Who can stand up to the Anakim?” '
    3: "³ Know then today that the Lord your God is the one who crosses over before\
      \ you as a devouring fire; he will defeat them and subdue them before you, so\
      \ that you may dispossess and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has promised\
      \ you. \n"
    4: '⁴ When the Lord your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself,
      “It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to occupy
      this land”; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the
      Lord is dispossessing them before you. '
    5: "⁵ It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart\
      \ that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness\
      \ of these nations the Lord your God is dispossessing them before you, in order\
      \ to fulfill the promise that the Lord made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham,\
      \ to Isaac, and to Jacob. \n"
    6: '⁶ Know, then, that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to occupy
      because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people. '
    7: "⁷ Remember and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in\
      \ the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the Lord from the day you\
      \ came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place. \n"
    8: '⁸ Even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was so angry
      with you that he was ready to destroy you. '
    9: '⁹ When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of
      the covenant that the Lord made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days
      and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the Lord gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of
      God; on them were all the words that the Lord had spoken to you at the mountain
      out of the fire on the day of the assembly. '
    11: '¹¹ At the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two stone
      tablets, the tablets of the covenant. '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord said to me, “Get up, go down quickly from here, for your
      people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been
      quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for
      themselves.” '
    13: '¹³ Furthermore the Lord said to me, “I have seen that this people is indeed
      a stubborn people. '
    14: "¹⁴ Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under\
      \ heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and more numerous than they.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was ablaze;
      the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then I saw that you had indeed sinned against the Lord your God, by casting
      for yourselves an image of a calf; you had been quick to turn from the way that
      the Lord had commanded you. '
    17: '¹⁷ So I took hold of the two tablets and flung them from my two hands, smashing
      them before your eyes. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then I lay prostrate before the Lord as before, forty days and forty nights;
      I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed,
      provoking the Lord by doing what was evil in his sight. '
    19: '¹⁹ For I was afraid that the anger that the Lord bore against you was so
      fierce that he would destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time also. '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him, but
      I interceded also on behalf of Aaron at that same time. '
    21: "²¹ Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it with\
      \ fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly, until it was reduced to dust;\
      \ and I threw the dust of it into the stream that runs down the mountain. \n"
    22: '²² At Taberah also, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked
      the Lord to wrath. '
    23: '²³ And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and occupy
      the land that I have given you,” you rebelled against the command of the Lord
      your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him. '
    24: "²⁴ You have been rebellious against the Lord as long as he has known you.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before
      the Lord when the Lord intended to destroy you, '
    26: '²⁶ I prayed to the Lord and said, “Lord God, do not destroy the people who
      are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you
      brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    27: '²⁷ Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to
      the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin, '
    28: '²⁸ otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, ‘Because
      the Lord was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and
      because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.’ '
    29: ²⁹ For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out
      by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”
  10:
    1: '¹ At that time the Lord said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the
      former ones, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood. '
    2: '² I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which
      you smashed, and you shall put them in the ark.” '
    3: '³ So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the former
      ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. '
    4: '⁴ Then he wrote on the tablets the same words as before, the ten commandments
      that the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of
      the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me. '
    5: "⁵ So I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the\
      \ ark that I had made; and there they are, as the Lord commanded me. \n"
    6: '⁶ (The Israelites journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron
      died, and there he was buried; his son Eleazar succeeded him as priest. '
    7: '⁷ From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a
      land with flowing streams. '
    8: '⁸ At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the
      covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to him, and to bless
      in his name, to this day. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance with his kindred; the Lord\
      \ is his inheritance, as the Lord your God promised him.) \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I had done the
      first time. And once again the Lord listened to me. The Lord was unwilling to
      destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ The Lord said to me, “Get up, go on your journey at the head of the people,\
      \ that they may go in and occupy the land that I swore to their ancestors to\
      \ give them.” \n"
    12: '¹² So now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you? Only to
      fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord
      your God with all your heart and with all your soul, '
    13: '¹³ and to keep the commandments of the Lord your God and his decrees that
      I am commanding you today, for your own well-being. '
    14: '¹⁴ Although heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord your God,
      the earth with all that is in it, '
    15: '¹⁵ yet the Lord set his heart in love on your ancestors alone and chose you,
      their descendants after them, out of all the peoples, as it is today. '
    16: '¹⁶ Circumcise, then, the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn any
      longer. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God,
      mighty and awesome, who is not partial and takes no bribe, '
    18: '¹⁸ who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and who loves the strangers,
      providing them food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of
      Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall fear the Lord your God; him alone you shall worship; to him
      you shall hold fast, and by his name you shall swear. '
    21: '²¹ He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and
      awesome things that your own eyes have seen. '
    22: ²² Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons; and now the Lord your
      God has made you as numerous as the stars in heaven.
  11:
    1: '¹ You shall love the Lord your God, therefore, and keep his charge, his decrees,
      his ordinances, and his commandments always. '
    2: '² Remember today that it was not your children (who have not known or seen
      the discipline of the Lord your God), but it is you who must acknowledge his
      greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm, '
    3: '³ his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt,
      and to all his land; '
    4: '⁴ what he did to the Egyptian army, to their horses and chariots, how he made
      the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, so that the Lord
      has destroyed them to this day; '
    5: '⁵ what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; '
    6: '⁶ and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab son of Reuben, how in
      the midst of all Israel the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along
      with their households, their tents, and every living being in their company; '
    7: "⁷ for it is your own eyes that have seen every great deed that the Lord did.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Keep, then, this entire commandment that I am commanding you today, so that
      you may have strength to go in and occupy the land that you are crossing over
      to occupy, '
    9: '⁹ and so that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors
      to give them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    10: '¹⁰ For the land that you are about to enter to occupy is not like the land
      of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sow your seed and irrigate by
      foot like a vegetable garden. '
    11: '¹¹ But the land that you are crossing over to occupy is a land of hills and
      valleys, watered by rain from the sky, '
    12: "¹² a land that the Lord your God looks after. The eyes of the Lord your God\
      \ are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. \n"
    13: '¹³ If you will only heed his every commandment that I am commanding you today—loving
      the Lord your God, and serving him with all your heart and with all your soul— '
    14: '¹⁴ then he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain
      and the later rain, and you will gather in your grain, your wine, and your oil; '
    15: '¹⁵ and he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will
      eat your fill. '
    16: '¹⁶ Take care, or you will be seduced into turning away, serving other gods
      and worshiping them, '
    17: "¹⁷ for then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and he will\
      \ shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain and the land will yield\
      \ no fruit; then you will perish quickly off the good land that the Lord is\
      \ giving you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ You shall put these words of mine in your heart and soul, and you shall
      bind them as a sign on your hand, and fix them as an emblem on your forehead. '
    19: '¹⁹ Teach them to your children, talking about them when you are at home and
      when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise. '
    20: '²⁰ Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, '
    21: "²¹ so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the\
      \ land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens\
      \ are above the earth. \n"
    22: '²² If you will diligently observe this entire commandment that I am commanding
      you, loving the Lord your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to
      him, '
    23: '²³ then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will
      dispossess nations larger and mightier than yourselves. '
    24: '²⁴ Every place on which you set foot shall be yours; your territory shall
      extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates,
      to the Western Sea. '
    25: "²⁵ No one will be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put the\
      \ fear and dread of you on all the land on which you set foot, as he promised\
      \ you. \n"
    26: '²⁶ See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: '
    27: '²⁷ the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I
      am commanding you today; '
    28: "²⁸ and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God,\
      \ but turn from the way that I am commanding you today, to follow other gods\
      \ that you have not known. \n"
    29: '²⁹ When the Lord your God has brought you into the land that you are entering
      to occupy, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount
      Ebal. '
    30: "³⁰ As you know, they are beyond the Jordan, some distance to the west, in\
      \ the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside\
      \ the oak of Moreh. \n"
    31: '³¹ When you cross the Jordan to go in to occupy the land that the Lord your
      God is giving you, and when you occupy it and live in it, '
    32: ³² you must diligently observe all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting
      before you today.
  12:
    1: "¹ These are the statutes and ordinances that you must diligently observe in\
      \ the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you to occupy\
      \ all the days that you live on the earth. \n"
    2: '² You must demolish completely all the places where the nations whom you are
      about to dispossess served their gods, on the mountain heights, on the hills,
      and under every leafy tree. '
    3: '³ Break down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their sacred poles with
      fire, and hew down the idols of their gods, and thus blot out their name from
      their places. '
    4: '⁴ You shall not worship the Lord your God in such ways. '
    5: '⁵ But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all
      your tribes as his habitation to put his name there. You shall go there, '
    6: '⁶ bringing there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and
      your donations, your votive gifts, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
      of your herds and flocks. '
    7: "⁷ And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your\
      \ households together, rejoicing in all the undertakings in which the Lord your\
      \ God has blessed you. \n"
    8: '⁸ You shall not act as we are acting here today, all of us according to our
      own desires, '
    9: '⁹ for you have not yet come into the rest and the possession that the Lord
      your God is giving you. '
    10: '¹⁰ When you cross over the Jordan and live in the land that the Lord your
      God is allotting to you, and when he gives you rest from your enemies all around
      so that you live in safety, '
    11: '¹¹ then you shall bring everything that I command you to the place that the
      Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name: your burnt offerings and
      your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all your choice votive
      gifts that you vow to the Lord. '
    12: "¹² And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you together with your\
      \ sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levites who\
      \ reside in your towns (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you).\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place you
      happen to see. '
    14: "¹⁴ But only at the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes—there\
      \ you shall offer your burnt offerings and there you shall do everything I command\
      \ you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yet whenever you desire you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your
      towns, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has given you; the unclean
      and the clean may eat of it, as they would of gazelle or deer. '
    16: '¹⁶ The blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground
      like water. '
    17: '¹⁷ Nor may you eat within your towns the tithe of your grain, your wine,
      and your oil, the firstlings of your herds and your flocks, any of your votive
      gifts that you vow, your freewill offerings, or your donations; '
    18: '¹⁸ these you shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God at the place
      that the Lord your God will choose, you together with your son and your daughter,
      your male and female slaves, and the Levites resident in your towns, rejoicing
      in the presence of the Lord your God in all your undertakings. '
    19: "¹⁹ Take care that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your\
      \ land. \n"
    20: '²⁰ When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you,
      and you say, “I am going to eat some meat,” because you wish to eat meat, you
      may eat meat whenever you have the desire. '
    21: '²¹ If the place where the Lord your God will choose to put his name is too
      far from you, and you slaughter as I have commanded you any of your herd or
      flock that the Lord has given you, then you may eat within your towns whenever
      you desire. '
    22: '²² Indeed, just as gazelle or deer is eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean
      and the clean alike may eat it. '
    23: '²³ Only be sure that you do not eat the blood; for the blood is the life,
      and you shall not eat the life with the meat. '
    24: '²⁴ Do not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water. '
    25: '²⁵ Do not eat it, so that all may go well with you and your children after
      you, because you do what is right in the sight of the Lord. '
    26: '²⁶ But the sacred donations that are due from you, and your votive gifts,
      you shall bring to the place that the Lord will choose. '
    27: "²⁷ You shall present your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on\
      \ the altar of the Lord your God; the blood of your other sacrifices shall be\
      \ poured out beside the altar of the Lord your God, but the meat you may eat.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Be careful to obey all these words that I command you today, so that it\
      \ may go well with you and with your children after you forever, because you\
      \ will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God. \n"
    29: '²⁹ When the Lord your God has cut off before you the nations whom you are
      about to enter to dispossess them, when you have dispossessed them and live
      in their land, '
    30: '³⁰ take care that you are not snared into imitating them, after they have
      been destroyed before you: do not inquire concerning their gods, saying, “How
      did these nations worship their gods? I also want to do the same.” '
    31: '³¹ You must not do the same for the Lord your God, because every abhorrent
      thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods. They would even burn
      their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods. '
    32: ³² You must diligently observe everything that I command you; do not add to
      it or take anything from it.
  13:
    1: '¹ If prophets or those who divine by dreams appear among you and promise you
      omens or portents, '
    2: '² and the omens or the portents declared by them take place, and they say,
      “Let us follow other gods” (whom you have not known) “and let us serve them,” '
    3: '³ you must not heed the words of those prophets or those who divine by dreams;
      for the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you indeed love the Lord
      your God with all your heart and soul. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord your God you shall follow, him alone you shall fear, his commandments
      you shall keep, his voice you shall obey, him you shall serve, and to him you
      shall hold fast. '
    5: "⁵ But those prophets or those who divine by dreams shall be put to death for\
      \ having spoken treason against the Lord your God—who brought you out of the\
      \ land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery—to turn you from\
      \ the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge\
      \ the evil from your midst. \n"
    6: '⁶ If anyone secretly entices you—even if it is your brother, your father’s
      son or your mother’s son, or your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace,
      or your most intimate friend—saying, “Let us go worship other gods,” whom neither
      you nor your ancestors have known, '
    7: '⁷ any of the gods of the peoples that are around you, whether near you or
      far away from you, from one end of the earth to the other, '
    8: '⁸ you must not yield to or heed any such persons. Show them no pity or compassion
      and do not shield them. '
    9: '⁹ But you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them
      to execute them, and afterwards the hand of all the people. '
    10: '¹⁰ Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the Lord your God,
      who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. '
    11: "¹¹ Then all Israel shall hear and be afraid, and never again do any such\
      \ wickedness. \n"
    12: '¹² If you hear it said about one of the towns that the Lord your God is giving
      you to live in, '
    13: '¹³ that scoundrels from among you have gone out and led the inhabitants of
      the town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods,” whom you have not
      known, '
    14: '¹⁴ then you shall inquire and make a thorough investigation. If the charge
      is established that such an abhorrent thing has been done among you, '
    15: '¹⁵ you shall put the inhabitants of that town to the sword, utterly destroying
      it and everything in it—even putting its livestock to the sword. '
    16: '¹⁶ All of its spoil you shall gather into its public square; then burn the
      town and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your
      God. It shall remain a perpetual ruin, never to be rebuilt. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not let anything devoted to destruction stick to your hand, so that
      the Lord may turn from his fierce anger and show you compassion, and in his
      compassion multiply you, as he swore to your ancestors, '
    18: ¹⁸ if you obey the voice of the Lord your God by keeping all his commandments
      that I am commanding you today, doing what is right in the sight of the Lord
      your God.
  14:
    1: '¹ You are children of the Lord your God. You must not lacerate yourselves
      or shave your forelocks for the dead. '
    2: "² For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; it is you the Lord has chosen\
      \ out of all the peoples on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ You shall not eat any abhorrent thing. '
    4: '⁴ These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, '
    5: '⁵ the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope,
      and the mountain-sheep. '
    6: '⁶ Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof cleft in two, and chews
      the cud, among the animals, you may eat. '
    7: '⁷ Yet of those that chew the cud or have the hoof cleft you shall not eat
      these: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but
      do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you. '
    8: "⁸ And the pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean\
      \ for you. You shall not eat their meat, and you shall not touch their carcasses.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Of all that live in water you may eat these: whatever has fins and scales
      you may eat. '
    10: "¹⁰ And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean\
      \ for you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ You may eat any clean birds. '
    12: '¹² But these are the ones that you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture,
      the osprey, '
    13: '¹³ the buzzard, the kite of any kind; '
    14: '¹⁴ every raven of any kind; '
    15: '¹⁵ the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk of any kind; '
    16: '¹⁶ the little owl and the great owl, the water hen '
    17: '¹⁷ and the desert owl, the carrion vulture and the cormorant, '
    18: '¹⁸ the stork, the heron of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat. '
    19: '¹⁹ And all winged insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten. '
    20: "²⁰ You may eat any clean winged creature. \n"
    21: "²¹ You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to aliens\
      \ residing in your towns for them to eat, or you may sell it to a foreigner.\
      \ For you are a people holy to the Lord your God.\nYou shall not boil a kid\
      \ in its mother’s milk. \n"
    22: '²² Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly
      from the field. '
    23: '²³ In the presence of the Lord your God, in the place that he will choose
      as a dwelling for his name, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, your wine,
      and your oil, as well as the firstlings of your herd and flock, so that you
      may learn to fear the Lord your God always. '
    24: '²⁴ But if, when the Lord your God has blessed you, the distance is so great
      that you are unable to transport it, because the place where the Lord your God
      will choose to set his name is too far away from you, '
    25: '²⁵ then you may turn it into money. With the money secure in hand, go to
      the place that the Lord your God will choose; '
    26: '²⁶ spend the money for whatever you wish—oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink,
      or whatever you desire. And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord
      your God, you and your household rejoicing together. '
    27: "²⁷ As for the Levites resident in your towns, do not neglect them, because\
      \ they have no allotment or inheritance with you. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Every third year you shall bring out the full tithe of your produce for
      that year, and store it within your towns; '
    29: ²⁹ the Levites, because they have no allotment or inheritance with you, as
      well as the resident aliens, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, may
      come and eat their fill so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work
      that you undertake.
  15:
    1: '¹ Every seventh year you shall grant a remission of debts. '
    2: '² And this is the manner of the remission: every creditor shall remit the
      claim that is held against a neighbor, not exacting it of a neighbor who is
      a member of the community, because the Lord’s remission has been proclaimed. '
    3: '³ Of a foreigner you may exact it, but you must remit your claim on whatever
      any member of your community owes you. '
    4: '⁴ There will, however, be no one in need among you, because the Lord is sure
      to bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a possession
      to occupy, '
    5: '⁵ if only you will obey the Lord your God by diligently observing this entire
      commandment that I command you today. '
    6: "⁶ When the Lord your God has blessed you, as he promised you, you will lend\
      \ to many nations, but you will not borrow; you will rule over many nations,\
      \ but they will not rule over you. \n"
    7: '⁷ If there is among you anyone in need, a member of your community in any
      of your towns within the land that the Lord your God is giving you, do not be
      hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your needy neighbor. '
    8: '⁸ You should rather open your hand, willingly lending enough to meet the need,
      whatever it may be. '
    9: '⁹ Be careful that you do not entertain a mean thought, thinking, “The seventh
      year, the year of remission, is near,” and therefore view your needy neighbor
      with hostility and give nothing; your neighbor might cry to the Lord against
      you, and you would incur guilt. '
    10: '¹⁰ Give liberally and be ungrudging when you do so, for on this account the
      Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake. '
    11: "¹¹ Since there will never cease to be some in need on the earth, I therefore\
      \ command you, “Open your hand to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² If a member of your community, whether a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman,
      is sold to you and works for you six years, in the seventh year you shall set
      that person free. '
    13: '¹³ And when you send a male slave out from you a free person, you shall not
      send him out empty-handed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Provide liberally out of your flock, your threshing floor, and your wine
      press, thus giving to him some of the bounty with which the Lord your God has
      blessed you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your
      God redeemed you; for this reason I lay this command upon you today. '
    16: '¹⁶ But if he says to you, “I will not go out from you,” because he loves
      you and your household, since he is well off with you, '
    17: "¹⁷ then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his earlobe into the\
      \ door, and he shall be your slave forever.\nYou shall do the same with regard\
      \ to your female slave. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Do not consider it a hardship when you send them out from you free persons,\
      \ because for six years they have given you services worth the wages of hired\
      \ laborers; and the Lord your God will bless you in all that you do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Every firstling male born of your herd and flock you shall consecrate
      to the Lord your God; you shall not do work with your firstling ox nor shear
      the firstling of your flock. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall eat it, you together with your household, in the presence of
      the Lord your God year by year at the place that the Lord will choose. '
    21: '²¹ But if it has any defect—any serious defect, such as lameness or blindness—you
      shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God; '
    22: '²² within your towns you may eat it, the unclean and the clean alike, as
      you would a gazelle or deer. '
    23: ²³ Its blood, however, you must not eat; you shall pour it out on the ground
      like water.
  16:
    1: '¹ Observe the month of Abib by keeping the passover to the Lord your God,
      for in the month of Abib the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² You shall offer the passover sacrifice to the Lord your God, from the flock
      and the herd, at the place that the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his name. '
    3: '³ You must not eat with it anything leavened. For seven days you shall eat
      unleavened bread with it—the bread of affliction—because you came out of the
      land of Egypt in great haste, so that all the days of your life you may remember
      the day of your departure from the land of Egypt. '
    4: '⁴ No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days; and
      none of the meat of what you slaughter on the evening of the first day shall
      remain until morning. '
    5: '⁵ You are not permitted to offer the passover sacrifice within any of your
      towns that the Lord your God is giving you. '
    6: '⁶ But at the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his
      name, only there shall you offer the passover sacrifice, in the evening at sunset,
      the time of day when you departed from Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ You shall cook it and eat it at the place that the Lord your God will choose;
      the next morning you may go back to your tents. '
    8: "⁸ For six days you shall continue to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh\
      \ day there shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord your God, when you shall\
      \ do no work. \n"
    9: '⁹ You shall count seven weeks; begin to count the seven weeks from the time
      the sickle is first put to the standing grain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then you shall keep the festival of weeks to the Lord your God, contributing
      a freewill offering in proportion to the blessing that you have received from
      the Lord your God. '
    11: '¹¹ Rejoice before the Lord your God—you and your sons and your daughters,
      your male and female slaves, the Levites resident in your towns, as well as
      the strangers, the orphans, and the widows who are among you—at the place that
      the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. '
    12: "¹² Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and diligently observe these\
      \ statutes. \n"
    13: '¹³ You shall keep the festival of booths for seven days, when you have gathered
      in the produce from your threshing floor and your wine press. '
    14: '¹⁴ Rejoice during your festival, you and your sons and your daughters, your
      male and female slaves, as well as the Levites, the strangers, the orphans,
      and the widows resident in your towns. '
    15: "¹⁵ Seven days you shall keep the festival to the Lord your God at the place\
      \ that the Lord will choose; for the Lord your God will bless you in all your\
      \ produce and in all your undertakings, and you shall surely celebrate. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God
      at the place that he will choose: at the festival of unleavened bread, at the
      festival of weeks, and at the festival of booths. They shall not appear before
      the Lord empty-handed; '
    17: "¹⁷ all shall give as they are able, according to the blessing of the Lord\

    18: '¹⁸ You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes, in all
      your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall render just
      decisions for the people. '
    19: '¹⁹ You must not distort justice; you must not show partiality; and you must
      not accept bribes, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the
      cause of those who are in the right. '
    20: "²⁰ Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, so that you may live and\
      \ occupy the land that the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    21: '²¹ You shall not plant any tree as a sacred pole beside the altar that you
      make for the Lord your God; '
    22: ²² nor shall you set up a stone pillar—things that the Lord your God hates.
  17:
    1: "¹ You must not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has a\
      \ defect, anything seriously wrong; for that is abhorrent to the Lord your God.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² If there is found among you, in one of your towns that the Lord your God
      is giving you, a man or woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
      your God, and transgresses his covenant '
    3: '³ by going to serve other gods and worshiping them—whether the sun or the
      moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden— '
    4: '⁴ and if it is reported to you or you hear of it, and you make a thorough
      inquiry, and the charge is proved true that such an abhorrent thing has occurred
      in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ then you shall bring out to your gates that man or that woman who has committed
      this crime and you shall stone the man or woman to death. '
    6: '⁶ On the evidence of two or three witnesses the death sentence shall be executed;
      a person must not be put to death on the evidence of only one witness. '
    7: "⁷ The hands of the witnesses shall be the first raised against the person\
      \ to execute the death penalty, and afterward the hands of all the people. So\
      \ you shall purge the evil from your midst. \n"
    8: '⁸ If a judicial decision is too difficult for you to make between one kind
      of bloodshed and another, one kind of legal right and another, or one kind of
      assault and another—any such matters of dispute in your towns—then you shall
      immediately go up to the place that the Lord your God will choose, '
    9: '⁹ where you shall consult with the levitical priests and the judge who is
      in office in those days; they shall announce to you the decision in the case. '
    10: '¹⁰ Carry out exactly the decision that they announce to you from the place
      that the Lord will choose, diligently observing everything they instruct you. '
    11: '¹¹ You must carry out fully the law that they interpret for you or the ruling
      that they announce to you; do not turn aside from the decision that they announce
      to you, either to the right or to the left. '
    12: '¹² As for anyone who presumes to disobey the priest appointed to minister
      there to the Lord your God, or the judge, that person shall die. So you shall
      purge the evil from Israel. '
    13: "¹³ All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously\
      \ again. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When you have come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you,
      and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “I will set
      a king over me, like all the nations that are around me,” '
    15: '¹⁵ you may indeed set over you a king whom the Lord your God will choose.
      One of your own community you may set as king over you; you are not permitted
      to put a foreigner over you, who is not of your own community. '
    16: '¹⁶ Even so, he must not acquire many horses for himself, or return the people
      to Egypt in order to acquire more horses, since the Lord has said to you, “You
      must never return that way again.” '
    17: '¹⁷ And he must not acquire many wives for himself, or else his heart will
      turn away; also silver and gold he must not acquire in great quantity for himself. '
    18: '¹⁸ When he has taken the throne of his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this
      law written for him in the presence of the levitical priests. '
    19: '¹⁹ It shall remain with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life,
      so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, diligently observing all the
      words of this law and these statutes, '
    20: ²⁰ neither exalting himself above other members of the community nor turning
      aside from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he and
      his descendants may reign long over his kingdom in Israel.
  18:
    1: '¹ The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no allotment
      or inheritance within Israel. They may eat the sacrifices that are the Lord’s
      portion '
    2: "² but they shall have no inheritance among the other members of the community;\
      \ the Lord is their inheritance, as he promised them. \n"
    3: '³ This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice,
      whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two
      jowls, and the stomach. '
    4: '⁴ The first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the
      first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. '
    5: "⁵ For the Lord your God has chosen Levi out of all your tribes, to stand and\
      \ minister in the name of the Lord, him and his sons for all time. \n"
    6: '⁶ If a Levite leaves any of your towns, from wherever he has been residing
      in Israel, and comes to the place that the Lord will choose (and he may come
      whenever he wishes), '
    7: '⁷ then he may minister in the name of the Lord his God, like all his fellow-Levites
      who stand to minister there before the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ They shall have equal portions to eat, even though they have income from\
      \ the sale of family possessions. \n"
    9: '⁹ When you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must
      not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations. '
    10: '¹⁰ No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through
      fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, '
    11: '¹¹ or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks
      oracles from the dead. '
    12: '¹² For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord; it is because
      of such abhorrent practices that the Lord your God is driving them out before
      you. '
    13: '¹³ You must remain completely loyal to the Lord your God. '
    14: "¹⁴ Although these nations that you are about to dispossess do give heed to\
      \ soothsayers and diviners, as for you, the Lord your God does not permit you\
      \ to do so. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your
      own people; you shall heed such a prophet. '
    16: '¹⁶ This is what you requested of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of
      the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the Lord my God any more,
      or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Lord replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people;
      I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything
      that I command. '
    19: '¹⁹ Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my
      name, I myself will hold accountable. '
    20: '²⁰ But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes
      to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak—that
      prophet shall die.” '
    21: '²¹ You may say to yourself, “How can we recognize a word that the Lord has
      not spoken?” '
    22: ²² If a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord but the thing does not take
      place or prove true, it is a word that the Lord has not spoken. The prophet
      has spoken it presumptuously; do not be frightened by it.
  19:
    1: '¹ When the Lord your God has cut off the nations whose land the Lord your
      God is giving you, and you have dispossessed them and settled in their towns
      and in their houses, '
    2: '² you shall set apart three cities in the land that the Lord your God is giving
      you to possess. '
    3: "³ You shall calculate the distances and divide into three regions the land\
      \ that the Lord your God gives you as a possession, so that any homicide can\
      \ flee to one of them. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now this is the case of a homicide who might flee there and live, that is,
      someone who has killed another person unintentionally when the two had not been
      at enmity before: '
    5: '⁵ Suppose someone goes into the forest with another to cut wood, and when
      one of them swings the ax to cut down a tree, the head slips from the handle
      and strikes the other person who then dies; the killer may flee to one of these
      cities and live. '
    6: '⁶ But if the distance is too great, the avenger of blood in hot anger might
      pursue and overtake and put the killer to death, although a death sentence was
      not deserved, since the two had not been at enmity before. '
    7: "⁷ Therefore I command you: You shall set apart three cities. \n"
    8: '⁸ If the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors—and
      he will give you all the land that he promised your ancestors to give you, '
    9: '⁹ provided you diligently observe this entire commandment that I command you
      today, by loving the Lord your God and walking always in his ways—then you shall
      add three more cities to these three, '
    10: "¹⁰ so that the blood of an innocent person may not be shed in the land that\
      \ the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, thereby bringing bloodguilt\
      \ upon you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But if someone at enmity with another lies in wait and attacks and takes
      the life of that person, and flees into one of these cities, '
    12: '¹² then the elders of the killer’s city shall send to have the culprit taken
      from there and handed over to the avenger of blood to be put to death. '
    13: "¹³ Show no pity; you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel,\
      \ so that it may go well with you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker, set up by former generations,\
      \ on the property that will be allotted to you in the land that the Lord your\
      \ God is giving you to possess. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ A single witness shall not suffice to convict a person of any crime or
      wrongdoing in connection with any offense that may be committed. Only on the
      evidence of two or three witnesses shall a charge be sustained. '
    16: '¹⁶ If a malicious witness comes forward to accuse someone of wrongdoing, '
    17: '¹⁷ then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the Lord, before
      the priests and the judges who are in office in those days, '
    18: '¹⁸ and the judges shall make a thorough inquiry. If the witness is a false
      witness, having testified falsely against another, '
    19: '¹⁹ then you shall do to the false witness just as the false witness had meant
      to do to the other. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. '
    20: '²⁰ The rest shall hear and be afraid, and a crime such as this shall never
      again be committed among you. '
    21: '²¹ Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
      foot for foot.'
  20:
    1: '¹ When you go out to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots,
      an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them; for the Lord
      your God is with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. '
    2: '² Before you engage in battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to
      the troops, '
    3: '³ and shall say to them: “Hear, O Israel! Today you are drawing near to do
      battle against your enemies. Do not lose heart, or be afraid, or panic, or be
      in dread of them; '
    4: '⁴ for it is the Lord your God who goes with you, to fight for you against
      your enemies, to give you victory.” '
    5: '⁵ Then the officials shall address the troops, saying, “Has anyone built a
      new house but not dedicated it? He should go back to his house, or he might
      die in the battle and another dedicate it. '
    6: '⁶ Has anyone planted a vineyard but not yet enjoyed its fruit? He should go
      back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another be first to enjoy
      its fruit. '
    7: '⁷ Has anyone become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? He should
      go back to his house, or he might die in the battle and another marry her.” '
    8: '⁸ The officials shall continue to address the troops, saying, “Is anyone afraid
      or disheartened? He should go back to his house, or he might cause the heart
      of his comrades to melt like his own.” '
    9: "⁹ When the officials have finished addressing the troops, then the commanders\
      \ shall take charge of them. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of peace. '
    11: '¹¹ If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the
      people in it shall serve you at forced labor. '
    12: '¹² If it does not submit to you peacefully, but makes war against you, then
      you shall besiege it; '
    13: '¹³ and when the Lord your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all
      its males to the sword. '
    14: '¹⁴ You may, however, take as your booty the women, the children, livestock,
      and everything else in the town, all its spoil. You may enjoy the spoil of your
      enemies, which the Lord your God has given you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Thus you shall treat all the towns that are very far from you, which are
      not towns of the nations here. '
    16: '¹⁶ But as for the towns of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving
      you as an inheritance, you must not let anything that breathes remain alive. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall annihilate them—the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites
      and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—just as the Lord your God
      has commanded, '
    18: "¹⁸ so that they may not teach you to do all the abhorrent things that they\
      \ do for their gods, and you thus sin against the Lord your God. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ If you besiege a town for a long time, making war against it in order
      to take it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them. Although
      you may take food from them, you must not cut them down. Are trees in the field
      human beings that they should come under siege from you? '
    20: ²⁰ You may destroy only the trees that you know do not produce food; you may
      cut them down for use in building siegeworks against the town that makes war
      with you, until it falls.
  21:
    1: '¹ If, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, a body
      is found lying in open country, and it is not known who struck the person down, '
    2: '² then your elders and your judges shall come out to measure the distances
      to the towns that are near the body. '
    3: '³ The elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never
      been worked, one that has not pulled in the yoke; '
    4: '⁴ the elders of that town shall bring the heifer down to a wadi with running
      water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there
      in the wadi. '
    5: '⁵ Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the Lord your
      God has chosen them to minister to him and to pronounce blessings in the name
      of the Lord, and by their decision all cases of dispute and assault shall be
      settled. '
    6: '⁶ All the elders of that town nearest the body shall wash their hands over
      the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi, '
    7: '⁷ and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor were we
      witnesses to it. '
    8: '⁸ Absolve, O Lord, your people Israel, whom you redeemed; do not let the guilt
      of innocent blood remain in the midst of your people Israel.” Then they will
      be absolved of bloodguilt. '
    9: "⁹ So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, because\
      \ you must do what is right in the sight of the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you go out to war against your enemies, and the Lord your God hands
      them over to you and you take them captive, '
    11: '¹¹ suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman whom you desire and
      want to marry, '
    12: '¹² and so you bring her home to your house: she shall shave her head, pare
      her nails, '
    13: '¹³ discard her captive’s garb, and shall remain in your house a full month,
      mourning for her father and mother; after that you may go in to her and be her
      husband, and she shall be your wife. '
    14: "¹⁴ But if you are not satisfied with her, you shall let her go free and not\

      \ her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ If a man has two wives, one of them loved and the other disliked, and
      if both the loved and the disliked have borne him sons, the firstborn being
      the son of the one who is disliked, '
    16: '¹⁶ then on the day when he wills his possessions to his sons, he is not permitted
      to treat the son of the loved as the firstborn in preference to the son of the
      disliked, who is the firstborn. '
    17: "¹⁷ He must acknowledge as firstborn the son of the one who is disliked, giving\
      \ him a double portion of all that he has; since he is the first issue of his\
      \ virility, the right of the firstborn is his. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father
      and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, '

      and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” '
    21: "²¹ Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge\

      that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not

  22:
    1: '¹ You shall not watch your neighbor’s ox or sheep straying away and ignore

    4: "⁴ You shall not see your neighbor’s donkey or ox fallen on the road and ignore\

    5: "⁵ A woman shall not wear a man’s apparel, nor shall a man put on a woman’s\

      \ them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if you will not obey the Lord your God by diligently observing all\
      \ his commandments and decrees, which I am commanding you today, then all these\
      \ curses shall come upon you and overtake you: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground, the\
      \ increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you\
      \ go out. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The Lord will send upon you disaster, panic, and frustration in everything
      you attempt to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly, on account of
      the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken me. '
    21: '²¹ The Lord will make the pestilence cling to you until it has consumed you
      off the land that you are entering to possess. '
    22: '²² The Lord will afflict you with consumption, fever, inflammation, with
      fiery heat and drought, and with blight and mildew; they shall pursue you until
      you perish. '
    23: '²³ The sky over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you iron. '
    24: "²⁴ The Lord will change the rain of your land into powder, and only dust\
      \ shall come down upon you from the sky until you are destroyed. \n"
    25: '²⁵ The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you shall
      go out against them one way and flee before them seven ways. You shall become
      an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    26: '²⁶ Your corpses shall be food for every bird of the air and animal of the
      earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away. '
    27: '²⁷ The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with ulcers, scurvy,
      and itch, of which you cannot be healed. '
    28: '²⁸ The Lord will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind; '
    29: '²⁹ you shall grope about at noon as blind people grope in darkness, but you
      shall be unable to find your way; and you shall be continually abused and robbed,
      without anyone to help. '
    30: '³⁰ You shall become engaged to a woman, but another man shall lie with her.
      You shall build a house, but not live in it. You shall plant a vineyard, but
      not enjoy its fruit. '
    31: '³¹ Your ox shall be butchered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of
      it. Your donkey shall be stolen in front of you, and shall not be restored to
      you. Your sheep shall be given to your enemies, without anyone to help you. '
    32: '³² Your sons and daughters shall be given to another people, while you look
      on; you will strain your eyes looking for them all day but be powerless to do
      anything. '
    33: '³³ A people whom you do not know shall eat up the fruit of your ground and
      of all your labors; you shall be continually abused and crushed, '
    34: '³⁴ and driven mad by the sight that your eyes shall see. '
    35: '³⁵ The Lord will strike you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils
      of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your
      head. '
    36: '³⁶ The Lord will bring you, and the king whom you set over you, to a nation
      that neither you nor your ancestors have known, where you shall serve other
      gods, of wood and stone. '
    37: "³⁷ You shall become an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all\
      \ the peoples where the Lord will lead you. \n"
    38: '³⁸ You shall carry much seed into the field but shall gather little in, for
      the locust shall consume it. '
    39: '³⁹ You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink
      the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worm shall eat them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall
      not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives shall drop off. '
    41: '⁴¹ You shall have sons and daughters, but they shall not remain yours, for
      they shall go into captivity. '
    42: '⁴² All your trees and the fruit of your ground the cicada shall take over. '
    43: '⁴³ Aliens residing among you shall ascend above you higher and higher, while
      you shall descend lower and lower. '
    44: "⁴⁴ They shall lend to you but you shall not lend to them; they shall be the\
      \ head and you shall be the tail. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ All these curses shall come upon you, pursuing and overtaking you until
      you are destroyed, because you did not obey the Lord your God, by observing
      the commandments and the decrees that he commanded you. '
    46: "⁴⁶ They shall be among you and your descendants as a sign and a portent forever.\
      \ \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Because you did not serve the Lord your God joyfully and with gladness
      of heart for the abundance of everything, '
    48: '⁴⁸ therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the Lord will send against
      you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and lack of everything. He will put
      an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. '
    49: '⁴⁹ The Lord will bring a nation from far away, from the end of the earth,
      to swoop down on you like an eagle, a nation whose language you do not understand, '
    50: '⁵⁰ a grim-faced nation showing no respect to the old or favor to the young. '
    51: '⁵¹ It shall consume the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground
      until you are destroyed, leaving you neither grain, wine, and oil, nor the increase
      of your cattle and the issue of your flock, until it has made you perish. '
    52: '⁵² It shall besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls,
      in which you trusted, come down throughout your land; it shall besiege you in
      all your towns throughout the land that the Lord your God has given you. '
    53: '⁵³ In the desperate straits to which the enemy siege reduces you, you will
      eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your own sons and daughters whom the
      Lord your God has given you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Even the most refined and gentle of men among you will begrudge food to
      his own brother, to the wife whom he embraces, and to the last of his remaining
      children, '
    55: '⁵⁵ giving to none of them any of the flesh of his children whom he is eating,
      because nothing else remains to him, in the desperate straits to which the enemy
      siege will reduce you in all your towns. '
    56: '⁵⁶ She who is the most refined and gentle among you, so gentle and refined
      that she does not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge
      food to the husband whom she embraces, to her own son, and to her own daughter, '
    57: "⁵⁷ begrudging even the afterbirth that comes out from between her thighs,\
      \ and the children that she bears, because she is eating them in secret for\
      \ lack of anything else, in the desperate straits to which the enemy siege will\
      \ reduce you in your towns. \n"
    58: '⁵⁸ If you do not diligently observe all the words of this law that are written
      in this book, fearing this glorious and awesome name, the Lord your God, '
    59: '⁵⁹ then the Lord will overwhelm both you and your offspring with severe and
      lasting afflictions and grievous and lasting maladies. '
    60: '⁶⁰ He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were
      in dread, and they shall cling to you. '
    61: '⁶¹ Every other malady and affliction, even though not recorded in the book
      of this law, the Lord will inflict on you until you are destroyed. '
    62: '⁶² Although once you were as numerous as the stars in heaven, you shall be
      left few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God. '
    63: '⁶³ And just as the Lord took delight in making you prosperous and numerous,
      so the Lord will take delight in bringing you to ruin and destruction; you shall
      be plucked off the land that you are entering to possess. '
    64: '⁶⁴ The Lord will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth
      to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone, which
      neither you nor your ancestors have known. '
    65: '⁶⁵ Among those nations you shall find no ease, no resting place for the sole
      of your foot. There the Lord will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes,
      and a languishing spirit. '
    66: '⁶⁶ Your life shall hang in doubt before you; night and day you shall be in
      dread, with no assurance of your life. '
    67: '⁶⁷ In the morning you shall say, “If only it were evening!” and at evening
      you shall say, “If only it were morning!”—because of the dread that your heart
      shall feel and the sights that your eyes shall see. '
    68: ⁶⁸ The Lord will bring you back in ships to Egypt, by a route that I promised
      you would never see again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to
      your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.
  29:
    1: "¹ These are the words of the covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to make\
      \ with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant that\
      \ he had made with them at Horeb. \n"
    2: '² Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that the Lord
      did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants
      and to all his land, '
    3: '³ the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders. '
    4: '⁴ But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind to understand, or eyes
      to see, or ears to hear. '
    5: '⁵ I have led you forty years in the wilderness. The clothes on your back have
      not worn out, and the sandals on your feet have not worn out; '
    6: '⁶ you have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink—so
      that you may know that I am the Lord your God. '
    7: '⁷ When you came to this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan
      came out against us for battle, but we defeated them. '
    8: '⁸ We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the
      Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore diligently observe the words of this covenant, in order that you\
      \ may succeed in everything that you do. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ You stand assembled today, all of you, before the Lord your God—the leaders
      of your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel, '
    11: '¹¹ your children, your women, and the aliens who are in your camp, both those
      who cut your wood and those who draw your water— '
    12: '¹² to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, sworn by an oath, which
      the Lord your God is making with you today; '
    13: '¹³ in order that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may
      be your God, as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham,
      to Isaac, and to Jacob. '
    14: '¹⁴ I am making this covenant, sworn by an oath, not only with you who stand
      here with us today before the Lord our God, '
    15: '¹⁵ but also with those who are not here with us today. '
    16: '¹⁶ You know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the
      midst of the nations through which you passed. '
    17: '¹⁷ You have seen their detestable things, the filthy idols of wood and stone,
      of silver and gold, that were among them. '
    18: '¹⁸ It may be that there is among you a man or woman, or a family or tribe,
      whose heart is already turning away from the Lord our God to serve the gods
      of those nations. It may be that there is among you a root sprouting poisonous
      and bitter growth. '
    19: '¹⁹ All who hear the words of this oath and bless themselves, thinking in
      their hearts, “We are safe even though we go our own stubborn ways” (thus bringing
      disaster on moist and dry alike)— '
    20: '²⁰ the Lord will be unwilling to pardon them, for the Lord’s anger and passion
      will smoke against them. All the curses written in this book will descend on
      them, and the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven. '
    21: '²¹ The Lord will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity,
      in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the
      law. '
    22: '²² The next generation, your children who rise up after you, as well as the
      foreigner who comes from a distant country, will see the devastation of that
      land and the afflictions with which the Lord has afflicted it— '
    23: '²³ all its soil burned out by sulfur and salt, nothing planted, nothing sprouting,
      unable to support any vegetation, like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,
      Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord destroyed in his fierce anger— '
    24: '²⁴ they and indeed all the nations will wonder, “Why has the Lord done thus
      to this land? What caused this great display of anger?” '
    25: '²⁵ They will conclude, “It is because they abandoned the covenant of the
      Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them
      out of the land of Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ They turned and served other gods, worshiping them, gods whom they had
      not known and whom he had not allotted to them; '
    27: '²⁷ so the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land, bringing on it
      every curse written in this book. '
    28: '²⁸ The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and great wrath,
      and cast them into another land, as is now the case.” '
    29: ²⁹ The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the revealed things belong
      to us and to our children forever, to observe all the words of this law.
  30:
    1: '¹ When all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses
      that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where
      the Lord your God has driven you, '
    2: '² and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with
      all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, '
    3: '³ then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on
      you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has
      scattered you. '
    4: '⁴ Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world, from there the Lord your
      God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. '
    5: "⁵ The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed,\
      \ and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than\
      \ your ancestors. \n"
    6: '⁶ Moreover, the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of
      your descendants, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart
      and with all your soul, in order that you may live. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on the adversaries
      who took advantage of you. '
    8: '⁸ Then you shall again obey the Lord, observing all his commandments that
      I am commanding you today, '
    9: '⁹ and the Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all your undertakings,
      in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit
      of your soil. For the Lord will again take delight in prospering you, just as
      he delighted in prospering your ancestors, '
    10: "¹⁰ when you obey the Lord your God by observing his commandments and decrees\
      \ that are written in this book of the law, because you turn to the Lord your\
      \ God with all your heart and with all your soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Surely, this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard
      for you, nor is it too far away. '
    12: '¹² It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up to heaven for
      us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?” '
    13: '¹³ Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will cross to
      the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and
      observe it?” '
    14: "¹⁴ No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart\
      \ for you to observe. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity. '
    16: '¹⁶ If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding
      you today, by loving the Lord your God, walking in his ways, and observing his
      commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous,
      and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess. '
    17: '¹⁷ But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to
      bow down to other gods and serve them, '
    18: '¹⁸ I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long
      in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. '
    19: '¹⁹ I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before
      you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants
      may live, '
    20: ²⁰ loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that
      means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that
      the Lord swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
  31:
    1: '¹ When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, '
    2: '² he said to them: “I am now one hundred twenty years old. I am no longer
      able to get about, and the Lord has told me, ‘You shall not cross over this
      Jordan.’ '
    3: '³ The Lord your God himself will cross over before you. He will destroy these
      nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua also will cross over
      before you, as the Lord promised. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites,
      and to their land, when he destroyed them. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord will give them over to you and you shall deal with them in full
      accord with the command that I have given to you. '
    6: "⁶ Be strong and bold; have no fear or dread of them, because it is the Lord\
      \ your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: “Be
      strong and bold, for you are the one who will go with this people into the land
      that the Lord has sworn to their ancestors to give them; and you will put them
      in possession of it. '
    8: "⁸ It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not fail\
      \ you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Moses wrote down this law, and gave it to the priests, the sons of
      Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders
      of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moses commanded them: “Every seventh year, in the scheduled year of remission,
      during the festival of booths, '
    11: '¹¹ when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place
      that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. '
    12: '¹² Assemble the people—men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing
      in your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God and
      to observe diligently all the words of this law, '
    13: "¹³ and so that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn\
      \ to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing\
      \ over the Jordan to possess.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord said to Moses, “Your time to die is near; call Joshua and present
      yourselves in the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and
      Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting, '
    15: "¹⁵ and the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud; the pillar of\
      \ cloud stood at the entrance to the tent. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses, “Soon you will lie down with your ancestors. Then
      this people will begin to prostitute themselves to the foreign gods in their
      midst, the gods of the land into which they are going; they will forsake me,
      breaking my covenant that I have made with them. '
    17: '¹⁷ My anger will be kindled against them in that day. I will forsake them
      and hide my face from them; they will become easy prey, and many terrible troubles
      will come upon them. In that day they will say, ‘Have not these troubles come
      upon us because our God is not in our midst?’ '
    18: '¹⁸ On that day I will surely hide my face on account of all the evil they
      have done by turning to other gods. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now therefore write this song, and teach it to the Israelites; put it
      in their mouths, in order that this song may be a witness for me against the
      Israelites. '
    20: '²⁰ For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey,
      which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill
      and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and
      breaking my covenant. '
    21: '²¹ And when many terrible troubles come upon them, this song will confront
      them as a witness, because it will not be lost from the mouths of their descendants.
      For I know what they are inclined to do even now, before I have brought them
      into the land that I promised them on oath.” '
    22: "²² That very day Moses wrote this song and taught it to the Israelites. \n"
    23: "²³ Then the Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and\
      \ bold, for you shall bring the Israelites into the land that I promised them;\
      \ I will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ When Moses had finished writing down in a book the words of this law to
      the very end, '
    25: '²⁵ Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the
      Lord, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord your God; let it remain there as a witness against you. '
    27: '²⁷ For I know well how rebellious and stubborn you are. If you already have
      been so rebellious toward the Lord while I am still alive among you, how much
      more after my death! '
    28: '²⁸ Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that
      I may recite these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness
      against them. '
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly, turning\
      \ aside from the way that I have commanded you. In time to come trouble will\
      \ befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking\
      \ him to anger through the work of your hands.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Moses recited the words of this song, to the very end, in the hearing
      of the whole assembly of Israel:'
  32:
    1: "¹ Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;\n    let the earth hear the words\
      \ of my mouth.\n"
    2: "² May my teaching drop like the rain,\n    my speech condense like the dew;\n\
      like gentle rain on grass,\n    like showers on new growth.\n"
    3: "³ For I will proclaim the name of the Lord;\n    ascribe greatness to our\
      \ God! \n"
    4: "⁴ The Rock, his work is perfect,\n    and all his ways are just.\nA faithful\
      \ God, without deceit,\n    just and upright is he;\n"
    5: "⁵ yet his degenerate children have dealt falsely with him,\n    a perverse\
      \ and crooked generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Do you thus repay the Lord,\n    O foolish and senseless people?\nIs not\
      \ he your father, who created you,\n    who made you and established you?\n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of old,\n    consider the years long past;\nask your father,\
      \ and he will inform you;\n    your elders, and they will tell you.\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High apportioned the nations,\n    when he divided humankind,\n\
      he fixed the boundaries of the peoples\n    according to the number of the gods;\n"
    9: "⁹ the Lord’s own portion was his people,\n    Jacob his allotted share. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He sustained him in a desert land,\n    in a howling wilderness waste;\n\
      he shielded him, cared for him,\n    guarded him as the apple of his eye.\n"
