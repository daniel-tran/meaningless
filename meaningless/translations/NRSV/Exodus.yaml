Exodus:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob,
      each with his household: '
    2: '² Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, '
    3: '³ Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, '
    4: '⁴ Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. '
    5: '⁵ The total number of people born to Jacob was seventy. Joseph was already
      in Egypt. '
    6: '⁶ Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole generation. '
    7: "⁷ But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew\
      \ exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them. \n"
    8: '⁸ Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. '
    9: '⁹ He said to his people, “Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and
      more powerful than we. '
    10: '¹⁰ Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the
      event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.” '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor.
      They built supply cities, Pithom and Rameses, for Pharaoh. '
    12: '¹² But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread,
      so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. '
    13: '¹³ The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites, '
    14: "¹⁴ and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and\
      \ in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they\
      \ imposed on them. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah
      and the other Puah, '
    16: '¹⁶ “When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstool,
      if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she shall live.” '
    17: '¹⁷ But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded
      them, but they let the boys live. '
    18: '¹⁸ So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have
      you done this, and allowed the boys to live?” '
    19: '¹⁹ The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the
      Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes
      to them.” '
    20: '²⁰ So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became
      very strong. '
    21: '²¹ And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. '
    22: ²² Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every boy that is born to the Hebrews
      you shall throw into the Nile, but you shall let every girl live.”
  2:
    1: '¹ Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. '
    2: '² The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine
      baby, she hid him three months. '
    3: '³ When she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him, and
      plastered it with bitumen and pitch; she put the child in it and placed it among
      the reeds on the bank of the river. '
    4: "⁴ His sister stood at a distance, to see what would happen to him. \n"
    5: '⁵ The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants
      walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid
      to bring it. '
    6: '⁶ When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity
      on him. “This must be one of the Hebrews’ children,” she said. '
    7: '⁷ Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get you a nurse
      from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” '
    8: '⁸ Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Yes.” So the girl went and called the child’s
      mother. '
    9: '⁹ Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse it for me, and
      I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed it. '
    10: "¹⁰ When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and she\
      \ took him as her son. She named him Moses, “because,” she said, “I drew him\
      \ out of the water.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and saw their
      forced labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his kinsfolk. '
    12: '¹² He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian
      and hid him in the sand. '
    13: '¹³ When he went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting; and he said
      to the one who was in the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow Hebrew?” '
    14: '¹⁴ He answered, “Who made you a ruler and judge over us? Do you mean to kill
      me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “Surely the
      thing is known.” '
    15: "¹⁵ When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses.\nBut Moses fled from\
      \ Pharaoh. He settled in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well. "
    16: '¹⁶ The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water, and
      filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. '
    17: '¹⁷ But some shepherds came and drove them away. Moses got up and came to
      their defense and watered their flock. '
    18: '¹⁸ When they returned to their father Reuel, he said, “How is it that you
      have come back so soon today?” '
    19: '¹⁹ They said, “An Egyptian helped us against the shepherds; he even drew
      water for us and watered the flock.” '
    20: '²⁰ He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite
      him to break bread.” '
    21: '²¹ Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah
      in marriage. '
    22: "²² She bore a son, and he named him Gershom; for he said, “I have been an\
      \ alien residing in a foreign land.” \n"
    23: '²³ After a long time the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under
      their slavery, and cried out. Out of the slavery their cry for help rose up
      to God. '
    24: '²⁴ God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham,
      Isaac, and Jacob. '
    25: ²⁵ God looked upon the Israelites, and God took notice of them.
  3:
    1: '¹ Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian;
      he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. '
    2: '² There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a
      bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. '
    3: '³ Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see
      why the bush is not burned up.” '
    4: '⁴ When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out
      of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” '
    5: '⁵ Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the
      place on which you are standing is holy ground.” '
    6: "⁶ He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God\
      \ of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid\
      \ to look at God. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then the Lord said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in
      Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know
      their sufferings, '
    8: '⁸ and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them
      up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey,
      to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,
      the Hivites, and the Jebusites. '
    9: '⁹ The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians
      oppress them. '
    10: '¹⁰ So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites,
      out of Egypt.” '
    11: '¹¹ But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring
      the Israelites out of Egypt?” '
    12: "¹² He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that\
      \ it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall\
      \ worship God on this mountain.” \n"
    13: '¹³ But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The
      God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’
      what shall I say to them?” '
    14: '¹⁴ God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” He said further, “Thus you shall say
      to the Israelites, ‘I am has sent me to you.’” '
    15: "¹⁵ God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord,\
      \ the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God\
      \ of Jacob, has sent me to you’:\nThis is my name forever,\nand this my title\
      \ for all generations. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘The Lord, the
      God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared
      to me, saying: I have given heed to you and to what has been done to you in
      Egypt. '
    17: '¹⁷ I declare that I will bring you up out of the misery of Egypt, to the
      land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,
      and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ '
    18: '¹⁸ They will listen to your voice; and you and the elders of Israel shall
      go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has
      met with us; let us now go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that
      we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’ '
    19: '¹⁹ I know, however, that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled
      by a mighty hand. '
    20: '²⁰ So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that
      I will perform in it; after that he will let you go. '
    21: '²¹ I will bring this people into such favor with the Egyptians that, when
      you go, you will not go empty-handed; '
    22: ²² each woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman living in the neighbor’s
      house for jewelry of silver and of gold, and clothing, and you shall put them
      on your sons and on your daughters; and so you shall plunder the Egyptians.”
  4:
    1: '¹ Then Moses answered, “But suppose they do not believe me or listen to me,
      but say, ‘The Lord did not appear to you.’” '
    2: '² The Lord said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.” '
    3: '³ And he said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw the staff on the ground,
      and it became a snake; and Moses drew back from it. '
    4: '⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Reach out your hand, and seize it by the tail”—so
      he reached out his hand and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand— '
    5: "⁵ “so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their ancestors, the\
      \ God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Again, the Lord said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” He put his
      hand into his cloak; and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white
      as snow. '
    7: '⁷ Then God said, “Put your hand back into your cloak”—so he put his hand back
      into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored like the rest of his
      body— '
    8: '⁸ “If they will not believe you or heed the first sign, they may believe the
      second sign. '
    9: "⁹ If they will not believe even these two signs or heed you, you shall take\
      \ some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water that\
      \ you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But Moses said to the Lord, “O my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither
      in the past nor even now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow
      of speech and slow of tongue.” '
    11: '¹¹ Then the Lord said to him, “Who gives speech to mortals? Who makes them
      mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord? '
    12: '¹² Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak.” '
    13: '¹³ But he said, “O my Lord, please send someone else.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, “What
      of your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak fluently; even now
      he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you his heart will be glad. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with
      your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. '
    16: '¹⁶ He indeed shall speak for you to the people; he shall serve as a mouth
      for you, and you shall serve as God for him. '
    17: "¹⁷ Take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let
      me go back to my kindred in Egypt and see whether they are still living.” And
      Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” '
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt; for all those who
      were seeking your life are dead.” '
    20: "²⁰ So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and went back\
      \ to the land of Egypt; and Moses carried the staff of God in his hand. \n"
    21: '²¹ And the Lord said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform
      before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power; but I will harden
      his heart, so that he will not let the people go. '
    22: '²² Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the Lord: Israel is my firstborn
      son. '
    23: "²³ I said to you, “Let my son go that he may worship me.” But you refused\
      \ to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ On the way, at a place where they spent the night, the Lord met him and
      tried to kill him. '
    25: '²⁵ But Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched
      Moses’ feet with it, and said, “Truly you are a bridegroom of blood to me!” '
    26: "²⁶ So he let him alone. It was then she said, “A bridegroom of blood by circumcision.”\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he
      went; and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. '
    28: '²⁸ Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which he had sent him,
      and all the signs with which he had charged him. '
    29: '²⁹ Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites. '
    30: '³⁰ Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had spoken to Moses, and performed
      the signs in the sight of the people. '
    31: ³¹ The people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had given heed to
      the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
  5:
    1: '¹ Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says the Lord,
      the God of Israel, ‘Let my people go, so that they may celebrate a festival
      to me in the wilderness.’” '
    2: '² But Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should heed him and let Israel
      go? I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.” '
    3: '³ Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us; let
      us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the Lord our
      God, or he will fall upon us with pestilence or sword.” '
    4: '⁴ But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking
      the people away from their work? Get to your labors!” '
    5: '⁵ Pharaoh continued, “Now they are more numerous than the people of the land
      and yet you want them to stop working!” '
    6: '⁶ That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, as well as
      their supervisors, '
    7: '⁷ “You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as before; let
      them go and gather straw for themselves. '
    8: '⁸ But you shall require of them the same quantity of bricks as they have made
      previously; do not diminish it, for they are lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let
      us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’ '
    9: "⁹ Let heavier work be laid on them; then they will labor at it and pay no\
      \ attention to deceptive words.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the taskmasters and the supervisors of the people went out and said
      to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw. '
    11: '¹¹ Go and get straw yourselves, wherever you can find it; but your work will
      not be lessened in the least.’” '
    12: '¹² So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt, to gather stubble
      for straw. '
    13: '¹³ The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, the same daily
      assignment as when you were given straw.” '
    14: "¹⁴ And the supervisors of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had\
      \ set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why did you not finish the required\
      \ quantity of bricks yesterday and today, as you did before?” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Israelite supervisors came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you
      treat your servants like this? '
    16: '¹⁶ No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’
      Look how your servants are beaten! You are unjust to your own people.” '
    17: '¹⁷ He said, “You are lazy, lazy; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice
      to the Lord.’ '
    18: '¹⁸ Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, but you shall still
      deliver the same number of bricks.” '
    19: '¹⁹ The Israelite supervisors saw that they were in trouble when they were
      told, “You shall not lessen your daily number of bricks.” '
    20: '²⁰ As they left Pharaoh, they came upon Moses and Aaron who were waiting
      to meet them. '
    21: "²¹ They said to them, “The Lord look upon you and judge! You have brought\
      \ us into bad odor with Pharaoh and his officials, and have put a sword in their\
      \ hand to kill us.” \n"
    22: '²² Then Moses turned again to the Lord and said, “O Lord, why have you mistreated
      this people? Why did you ever send me? '
    23: ²³ Since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has mistreated
      this people, and you have done nothing at all to deliver your people.”
  6:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh:\
      \ Indeed, by a mighty hand he will let them go; by a mighty hand he will drive\
      \ them out of his land.” \n"
    2: '² God also spoke to Moses and said to him: “I am the Lord. '
    3: '³ I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name
      ‘The Lord’ I did not make myself known to them. '
    4: '⁴ I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan,
      the land in which they resided as aliens. '
    5: '⁵ I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians are
      holding as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant. '
    6: '⁶ Say therefore to the Israelites, ‘I am the Lord, and I will free you from
      the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver you from slavery to them. I will redeem
      you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. '
    7: '⁷ I will take you as my people, and I will be your God. You shall know that
      I am the Lord your God, who has freed you from the burdens of the Egyptians. '
    8: '⁸ I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and
      Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.’” '
    9: "⁹ Moses told this to the Israelites; but they would not listen to Moses, because\
      \ of their broken spirit and their cruel slavery. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord spoke to Moses, '
    11: '¹¹ “Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his
      land.” '
    12: '¹² But Moses spoke to the Lord, “The Israelites have not listened to me;
      how then shall Pharaoh listen to me, poor speaker that I am?” '
    13: "¹³ Thus the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them orders regarding\
      \ the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, charging them to free the Israelites\
      \ from the land of Egypt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The following are the heads of their ancestral houses: the sons of Reuben,
      the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families
      of Reuben. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the
      son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. '
    16: '¹⁶ The following are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogies:
      Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, and the length of Levi’s life was one hundred thirty-seven
      years. '
    17: '¹⁷ The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their families. '
    18: '¹⁸ The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, and the length of
      Kohath’s life was one hundred thirty-three years. '
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites
      according to their genealogies. '
    20: '²⁰ Amram married Jochebed his father’s sister and she bore him Aaron and
      Moses, and the length of Amram’s life was one hundred thirty-seven years. '
    21: '²¹ The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. '
    22: '²² The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. '
    23: '²³ Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and
      she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families
      of the Korahites. '
    25: "²⁵ Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore\
      \ him Phinehas. These are the heads of the ancestral houses of the Levites by\
      \ their families. \n"
    26: '²⁶ It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, “Bring the Israelites
      out of the land of Egypt, company by company.” '
    27: "²⁷ It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites\
      \ out of Egypt, the same Moses and Aaron. \n"
    28: '²⁸ On the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, '
    29: '²⁹ he said to him, “I am the Lord; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I
      am speaking to you.” '
    30: ³⁰ But Moses said in the Lord’s presence, “Since I am a poor speaker, why
      would Pharaoh listen to me?”
  7:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your
      brother Aaron shall be your prophet. '
    2: '² You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell
      Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land. '
    3: '³ But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and I will multiply my signs and wonders
      in the land of Egypt. '
    4: '⁴ When Pharaoh does not listen to you, I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring
      my people the Israelites, company by company, out of the land of Egypt by great
      acts of judgment. '
    5: '⁵ The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch out my hand
      against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.” '
    6: '⁶ Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the Lord commanded them. '
    7: "⁷ Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    9: '⁹ “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a wonder,’ then you shall say to Aaron,
      ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.’” '
    10: '¹⁰ So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord had commanded;
      Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a
      snake. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the
      magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts. '
    12: '¹² Each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes; but Aaron’s staff
      swallowed up theirs. '
    13: "¹³ Still Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as\
      \ the Lord had said. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened; he refuses
      to let the people go. '
    15: '¹⁵ Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; stand by
      at the river bank to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was turned
      into a snake. '
    16: '¹⁶ Say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you to say,
      “Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness.” But until
      now you have not listened. '
    17: '¹⁷ Thus says the Lord, “By this you shall know that I am the Lord.” See,
      with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile,
      and it shall be turned to blood. '
    18: '¹⁸ The fish in the river shall die, the river itself shall stink, and the
      Egyptians shall be unable to drink water from the Nile.’” '
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out\
      \ your hand over the waters of Egypt—over its rivers, its canals, and its ponds,\
      \ and all its pools of water—so that they may become blood; and there shall\
      \ be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in\
      \ vessels of stone.’” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh
      and of his officials he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the river,
      and all the water in the river was turned into blood, '
    21: '²¹ and the fish in the river died. The river stank so that the Egyptians
      could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout the whole land of
      Egypt. '
    22: '²² But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh’s
      heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the Lord had said. '
    23: '²³ Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this
      to heart. '
    24: "²⁴ And all the Egyptians had to dig along the Nile for water to drink, for\
      \ they could not drink the water of the river. \n"
    25: ²⁵ Seven days passed after the Lord had struck the Nile.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the
      Lord: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. '
    2: '² If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs. '
    3: '³ The river shall swarm with frogs; they shall come up into your palace, into
      your bedchamber and your bed, and into the houses of your officials and of your
      people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls. '
    4: '⁴ The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your officials.’” '
    5: '⁵ And the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your
      staff over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up on
      the land of Egypt.’” '
    6: '⁶ So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs
      came up and covered the land of Egypt. '
    7: "⁷ But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs up\
      \ on the land of Egypt. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Pray to the Lord to take
      away the frogs from me and my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice
      to the Lord.” '
    9: '⁹ Moses said to Pharaoh, “Kindly tell me when I am to pray for you and for
      your officials and for your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and
      your houses and be left only in the Nile.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “As you say! So that you may know
      that there is no one like the Lord our God, '
    11: '¹¹ the frogs shall leave you and your houses and your officials and your
      people; they shall be left only in the Nile.” '
    12: '¹² Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried out to the
      Lord concerning the frogs that he had brought upon Pharaoh. '
    13: '¹³ And the Lord did as Moses requested: the frogs died in the houses, the
      courtyards, and the fields. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. '
    15: "¹⁵ But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart,\
      \ and would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and
      strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole
      land of Egypt.’” '
    17: '¹⁷ And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck
      the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust
      of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt. '
    18: '¹⁸ The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could
      not. There were gnats on both humans and animals. '
    19: "¹⁹ And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God!” But Pharaoh’s\
      \ heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had\
      \ said. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and present yourself
      before Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus says the
      Lord: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. '
    21: '²¹ For if you will not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you,
      your officials, and your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the
      Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies; so also the land where they
      live. '
    22: '²² But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people live,
      so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I the Lord
      am in this land. '
    23: '²³ Thus I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This
      sign shall appear tomorrow.’” '
    24: "²⁴ The Lord did so, and great swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh\
      \ and into his officials’ houses; in all of Egypt the land was ruined because\
      \ of the flies. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your
      God within the land.” '
    26: '²⁶ But Moses said, “It would not be right to do so; for the sacrifices that
      we offer to the Lord our God are offensive to the Egyptians. If we offer in
      the sight of the Egyptians sacrifices that are offensive to them, will they
      not stone us? '
    27: '²⁷ We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to
      the Lord our God as he commands us.” '
    28: '²⁸ So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God
      in the wilderness, provided you do not go very far away. Pray for me.” '
    29: "²⁹ Then Moses said, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord that\
      \ the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his officials,\
      \ and from his people; only do not let Pharaoh again deal falsely by not letting\
      \ the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ And the Lord did as Moses asked: he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh,
      from his officials, and from his people; not one remained. '
    32: ³² But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and would not let the people
      go.
  9:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says
      the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship
      me. '
    2: '² For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them, '
    3: '³ the hand of the Lord will strike with a deadly pestilence your livestock
      in the field: the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks. '
    4: '⁴ But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and
      the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing shall die of all that belongs to the
      Israelites.’” '
    5: '⁵ The Lord set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the
      land.” '
    6: '⁶ And on the next day the Lord did so; all the livestock of the Egyptians
      died, but of the livestock of the Israelites not one died. '
    7: "⁷ Pharaoh inquired and found that not one of the livestock of the Israelites\
      \ was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the\
      \ people go. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the kiln,
      and let Moses throw it in the air in the sight of Pharaoh. '
    9: '⁹ It shall become fine dust all over the land of Egypt, and shall cause festering
      boils on humans and animals throughout the whole land of Egypt.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So they took soot from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw
      it in the air, and it caused festering boils on humans and animals. '
    11: '¹¹ The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the
      boils afflicted the magicians as well as all the Egyptians. '
    12: "¹² But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not listen to\
      \ them, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and present
      yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of the
      Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. '
    14: '¹⁴ For this time I will send all my plagues upon you yourself, and upon your
      officials, and upon your people, so that you may know that there is no one like
      me in all the earth. '
    15: '¹⁵ For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your
      people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth. '
    16: '¹⁶ But this is why I have let you live: to show you my power, and to make
      my name resound through all the earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them
      go. '
    18: '¹⁸ Tomorrow at this time I will cause the heaviest hail to fall that has
      ever fallen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. '
    19: '¹⁹ Send, therefore, and have your livestock and everything that you have
      in the open field brought to a secure place; every human or animal that is in
      the open field and is not brought under shelter will die when the hail comes
      down upon them.’” '
    20: '²⁰ Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord hurried their
      slaves and livestock off to a secure place. '
    21: "²¹ Those who did not regard the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock\
      \ in the open field. \n"
    22: '²² The Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that hail
      may fall on the whole land of Egypt, on humans and animals and all the plants
      of the field in the land of Egypt.” '
    23: '²³ Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the Lord sent thunder
      and hail, and fire came down on the earth. And the Lord rained hail on the land
      of Egypt; '
    24: '²⁴ there was hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of it, such
      heavy hail as had never fallen in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. '
    25: '²⁵ The hail struck down everything that was in the open field throughout
      all the land of Egypt, both human and animal; the hail also struck down all
      the plants of the field, and shattered every tree in the field. '
    26: "²⁶ Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “This time I
      have sinned; the Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. '
    28: '²⁸ Pray to the Lord! Enough of God’s thunder and hail! I will let you go;
      you need stay no longer.” '
    29: '²⁹ Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch
      out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more
      hail, so that you may know that the earth is the Lord’s. '
    30: '³⁰ But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear the
      Lord God.” '
    31: '³¹ (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear
      and the flax was in bud. '
    32: '³² But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming
      up.) '
    33: '³³ So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and stretched out his hands
      to the Lord; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured
      down on the earth. '
    34: '³⁴ But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased,
      he sinned once more and hardened his heart, he and his officials. '
    35: ³⁵ So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites
      go, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.
  10:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart
      and the heart of his officials, in order that I may show these signs of mine
      among them, '
    2: "² and that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I have made fools\
      \ of the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them—so that you may know\
      \ that I am the Lord.” \n"
    3: '³ So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord,
      the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before
      me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. '
    4: '⁴ For if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into
      your country. '
    5: '⁵ They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to
      see the land. They shall devour the last remnant left you after the hail, and
      they shall devour every tree of yours that grows in the field. '
    6: "⁶ They shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your officials and of\
      \ all the Egyptians—something that neither your parents nor your grandparents\
      \ have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.’” Then he turned and\
      \ went out from Pharaoh. \n"
    7: '⁷ Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long shall this fellow be a snare
      to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the Lord their God; do you
      not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?” '
    8: '⁸ So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go,
      worship the Lord your God! But which ones are to go?” '
    9: '⁹ Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our
      sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, because we have the Lord’s
      festival to celebrate.” '
    10: '¹⁰ He said to them, “The Lord indeed will be with you, if ever I let your
      little ones go with you! Plainly, you have some evil purpose in mind. '
    11: "¹¹ No, never! Your men may go and worship the Lord, for that is what you\
      \ are asking.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt,
      so that the locusts may come upon it and eat every plant in the land, all that
      the hail has left.” '
    13: '¹³ So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord
      brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; when morning
      came, the east wind had brought the locusts. '
    14: '¹⁴ The locusts came upon all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country
      of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever shall
      be again. '
    15: '¹⁵ They covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was black;
      and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that
      the hail had left; nothing green was left, no tree, no plant in the field, in
      all the land of Egypt. '
    16: '¹⁶ Pharaoh hurriedly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against
      the Lord your God, and against you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do forgive my sin just this once, and pray to the Lord your God that at
      the least he remove this deadly thing from me.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So he went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord changed the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the
      locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not a single locust was left in all
      the country of Egypt. '
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites\
      \ go. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that
      there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt.” '
    22: '²² So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was dense darkness
      in all the land of Egypt for three days. '
    23: '²³ People could not see one another, and for three days they could not move
      from where they were; but all the Israelites had light where they lived. '
    24: '²⁴ Then Pharaoh summoned Moses, and said, “Go, worship the Lord. Only your
      flocks and your herds shall remain behind. Even your children may go with you.” '
    25: '²⁵ But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings
      to sacrifice to the Lord our God. '
    26: '²⁶ Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for
      we must choose some of them for the worship of the Lord our God, and we will
      not know what to use to worship the Lord until we arrive there.” '
    27: '²⁷ But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them
      go. '
    28: '²⁸ Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Take care that you do not
      see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.” '
    29: ²⁹ Moses said, “Just as you say! I will never see your face again.”
  11:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and upon
      Egypt; afterwards he will let you go from here; indeed, when he lets you go,
      he will drive you away. '
    2: '² Tell the people that every man is to ask his neighbor and every woman is
      to ask her neighbor for objects of silver and gold.” '
    3: "³ The Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover,\
      \ Moses himself was a man of great importance in the land of Egypt, in the sight\
      \ of Pharaoh’s officials and in the sight of the people. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses said, “Thus says the Lord: About midnight I will go out through Egypt. '
    5: '⁵ Every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
      who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the female slave who is behind the
      handmill, and all the firstborn of the livestock. '
    6: '⁶ Then there will be a loud cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as
      has never been or will ever be again. '
    7: '⁷ But not a dog shall growl at any of the Israelites—not at people, not at
      animals—so that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt
      and Israel. '
    8: "⁸ Then all these officials of yours shall come down to me, and bow low to\
      \ me, saying, ‘Leave us, you and all the people who follow you.’ After that\
      \ I will leave.” And in hot anger he left Pharaoh. \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, in order that my
      wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” '
    10: ¹⁰ Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; but the Lord
      hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of
      his land.
  12:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: '
    2: '² This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first
      month of the year for you. '
    3: '³ Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they
      are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. '
    4: '⁴ If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest
      neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number
      of people who eat of it. '
    5: '⁵ Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from
      the sheep or from the goats. '
    6: '⁶ You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole
      assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. '
    7: '⁷ They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the
      lintel of the houses in which they eat it. '
    8: '⁸ They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over
      the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. '
    9: '⁹ Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire,
      with its head, legs, and inner organs. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains
      until the morning you shall burn. '
    11: '¹¹ This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your
      feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the
      passover of the Lord. '
    12: '¹² For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike
      down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on
      all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord. '
    13: "¹³ The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I\
      \ see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when\
      \ I strike the land of Egypt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it
      as a festival to the Lord; throughout your generations you shall observe it
      as a perpetual ordinance. '
    15: '¹⁵ Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall
      remove leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first
      day until the seventh day shall be cut off from Israel. '
    16: '¹⁶ On the first day you shall hold a solemn assembly, and on the seventh
      day a solemn assembly; no work shall be done on those days; only what everyone
      must eat, that alone may be prepared by you. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread, for on this very day
      I brought your companies out of the land of Egypt: you shall observe this day
      throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance. '
    18: '¹⁸ In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening
      of the twenty-first day, you shall eat unleavened bread. '
    19: '¹⁹ For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whoever eats
      what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether an
      alien or a native of the land. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat\
      \ unleavened bread. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select
      lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover lamb. '
    22: '²² Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and
      touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood in the basin. None of
      you shall go outside the door of your house until morning. '
    23: '²³ For the Lord will pass through to strike down the Egyptians; when he sees
      the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over that
      door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall observe this rite as a perpetual ordinance for you and your
      children. '
    25: '²⁵ When you come to the land that the Lord will give you, as he has promised,
      you shall keep this observance. '
    26: '²⁶ And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this observance?’ '
    27: "²⁷ you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to the Lord, for he passed\
      \ over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he struck down the Egyptians\
      \ but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed down and worshiped. \n"
    28: "²⁸ The Israelites went and did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
      from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the
      prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock. '
    30: '³⁰ Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his officials and all the Egyptians;
      and there was a loud cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone
      dead. '
    31: '³¹ Then he summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, “Rise up, go
      away from my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord, as you
      said. '
    32: "³² Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone. And bring a\
      \ blessing on me too!” \n"
    33: '³³ The Egyptians urged the people to hasten their departure from the land,
      for they said, “We shall all be dead.” '
    34: '³⁴ So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading
      bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders. '
    35: '³⁵ The Israelites had done as Moses told them; they had asked the Egyptians
      for jewelry of silver and gold, and for clothing, '
    36: "³⁶ and the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,\
      \ so that they let them have what they asked. And so they plundered the Egyptians.\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand
      men on foot, besides children. '
    38: '³⁸ A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers,
      both flocks and herds. '
    39: "³⁹ They baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of\
      \ Egypt; it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could\
      \ not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ The time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty
      years. '
    41: '⁴¹ At the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the companies
      of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. '
    42: "⁴² That was for the Lord a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land\
      \ of Egypt. That same night is a vigil to be kept for the Lord by all the Israelites\
      \ throughout their generations. \n"
    43: '⁴³ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover:
      no foreigner shall eat of it, '
    44: '⁴⁴ but any slave who has been purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised; '
    45: '⁴⁵ no bound or hired servant may eat of it. '
    46: '⁴⁶ It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the animal outside
      the house, and you shall not break any of its bones. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The whole congregation of Israel shall celebrate it. '
    48: '⁴⁸ If an alien who resides with you wants to celebrate the passover to the
      Lord, all his males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to celebrate
      it; he shall be regarded as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person
      shall eat of it; '
    49: "⁴⁹ there shall be one law for the native and for the alien who resides among\
      \ you. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ All the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron. '
    51: ⁵¹ That very day the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,
      company by company.
  13:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses: '
    2: "² Consecrate to me all the firstborn; whatever is the first to open the womb\
      \ among the Israelites, of human beings and animals, is mine. \n"
    3: '³ Moses said to the people, “Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt,
      out of the house of slavery, because the Lord brought you out from there by
      strength of hand; no leavened bread shall be eaten. '
    4: '⁴ Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out. '
    5: '⁵ When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites,
      the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your ancestors
      to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this observance
      in this month. '
    6: '⁶ Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there
      shall be a festival to the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall
      be seen in your possession, and no leaven shall be seen among you in all your
      territory. '
    8: '⁸ You shall tell your child on that day, ‘It is because of what the Lord did
      for me when I came out of Egypt.’ '
    9: '⁹ It shall serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your
      forehead, so that the teaching of the Lord may be on your lips; for with a strong
      hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt. '
    10: "¹⁰ You shall keep this ordinance at its proper time from year to year. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “When the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, as he
      swore to you and your ancestors, and has given it to you, '
    12: '¹² you shall set apart to the Lord all that first opens the womb. All the
      firstborn of your livestock that are males shall be the Lord’s. '
    13: '¹³ But every firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not
      redeem it, you must break its neck. Every firstborn male among your children
      you shall redeem. '
    14: '¹⁴ When in the future your child asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall
      answer, ‘By strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, from the house
      of slavery. '
    15: '¹⁵ When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed all the
      firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human firstborn to the firstborn of animals.
      Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord every male that first opens the womb, but
      every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ '
    16: "¹⁶ It shall serve as a sign on your hand and as an emblem on your forehead\
      \ that by strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land
      of the Philistines, although that was nearer; for God thought, “If the people
      face war, they may change their minds and return to Egypt.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So God led the people by the roundabout way of the wilderness toward the
      Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for battle. '
    19: '¹⁹ And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph who had required a solemn
      oath of the Israelites, saying, “God will surely take notice of you, and then
      you must carry my bones with you from here.” '
    20: '²⁰ They set out from Succoth, and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. '
    21: '²¹ The Lord went in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day, to lead them
      along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, so that
      they might travel by day and by night. '
    22: ²² Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left
      its place in front of the people.
  14:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to Moses: '
    2: '² Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between
      Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall camp opposite it, by
      the sea. '
    3: '³ Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, “They are wandering aimlessly in the
      land; the wilderness has closed in on them.” '
    4: "⁴ I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them, so that I will gain\
      \ glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know\
      \ that I am the Lord. And they did so. \n"
    5: '⁵ When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the minds of Pharaoh
      and his officials were changed toward the people, and they said, “What have
      we done, letting Israel leave our service?” '
    6: '⁶ So he had his chariot made ready, and took his army with him; '
    7: '⁷ he took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt
      with officers over all of them. '
    8: '⁸ The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the
      Israelites, who were going out boldly. '
    9: "⁹ The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his chariot\
      \ drivers and his army; they overtook them camped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth,\
      \ in front of Baal-zephon. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As Pharaoh drew near, the Israelites looked back, and there were the Egyptians
      advancing on them. In great fear the Israelites cried out to the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that
      you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, bringing
      us out of Egypt? '
    12: '¹² Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone and let
      us serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
      than to die in the wilderness.” '
    13: '¹³ But Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, stand firm, and see the
      deliverance that the Lord will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom
      you see today you shall never see again. '
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to keep still.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites
      to go forward. '
    16: '¹⁶ But you lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and
      divide it, that the Israelites may go into the sea on dry ground. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in
      after them; and so I will gain glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army,
      his chariots, and his chariot drivers. '
    18: "¹⁸ And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gained glory\
      \ for myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his chariot drivers.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The angel of God who was going before the Israelite army moved and went
      behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and took its
      place behind them. '
    20: "²⁰ It came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel. And so the cloud\
      \ was there with the darkness, and it lit up the night; one did not come near\
      \ the other all night. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The Lord drove the sea
      back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and
      the waters were divided. '
    22: '²² The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall
      for them on their right and on their left. '
    23: '²³ The Egyptians pursued, and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh’s
      horses, chariots, and chariot drivers. '
    24: '²⁴ At the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and cloud looked down
      upon the Egyptian army, and threw the Egyptian army into panic. '
    25: "²⁵ He clogged their chariot wheels so that they turned with difficulty. The\
      \ Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the Lord is fighting\
      \ for them against Egypt.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that
      the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot
      drivers.” '
    27: '²⁷ So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned
      to its normal depth. As the Egyptians fled before it, the Lord tossed the Egyptians
      into the sea. '
    28: '²⁸ The waters returned and covered the chariots and the chariot drivers,
      the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not one of them
      remained. '
    29: "²⁹ But the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters forming\
      \ a wall for them on their right and on their left. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the Egyptians; and Israel saw
      the Egyptians dead on the seashore. '
    31: ³¹ Israel saw the great work that the Lord did against the Egyptians. So the
      people feared the Lord and believed in the Lord and in his servant Moses.
  15:
    1: "¹ Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord:\n“I will sing\
      \ to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;\n    horse and rider he has\
      \ thrown into the sea.\n"
    2: "² The Lord is my strength and my might,\n    and he has become my salvation;\n\
      this is my God, and I will praise him,\n    my father’s God, and I will exalt\
      \ him.\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is a warrior;\n    the Lord is his name. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he cast into the sea;\n    his picked officers\
      \ were sunk in the Red Sea.\n"
    5: "⁵ The floods covered them;\n    they went down into the depths like a stone.\n"
    6: "⁶ Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power—\n    your right hand, O Lord,\
      \ shattered the enemy.\n"
    7: "⁷ In the greatness of your majesty you overthrew your adversaries;\n    you\
      \ sent out your fury, it consumed them like stubble.\n"
    8: "⁸ At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up,\n    the floods stood\
      \ up in a heap;\n    the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.\n"
    9: "⁹ The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,\n    I will divide the\
      \ spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them.\n    I will draw my sword, my\
      \ hand shall destroy them.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You blew with your wind, the sea covered them;\n    they sank like lead\
      \ in the mighty waters. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?\n    Who is like you, majestic\
      \ in holiness,\n    awesome in splendor, doing wonders?\n"
    12: "¹² You stretched out your right hand,\n    the earth swallowed them. \n"
    13: "¹³ “In your steadfast love you led the people whom you redeemed;\n    you\
      \ guided them by your strength to your holy abode.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The peoples heard, they trembled;\n    pangs seized the inhabitants of\
      \ Philistia.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed;\n    trembling seized the leaders\
      \ of Moab;\n    all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Terror and dread fell upon them;\n    by the might of your arm, they became\
      \ still as a stone\nuntil your people, O Lord, passed by,\n    until the people\
      \ whom you acquired passed by.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ You brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your own possession,\n\
      \    the place, O Lord, that you made your abode,\n    the sanctuary, O Lord,\
      \ that your hands have established.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord will reign forever and ever.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ When the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his chariot drivers went\
      \ into the sea, the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the\
      \ Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the prophet Miriam, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand;
      and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing. '
    21: "²¹ And Miriam sang to them:\n“Sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously;\n\
      horse and rider he has thrown into the sea.” \n"
    22: '²² Then Moses ordered Israel to set out from the Red Sea, and they went into
      the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no
      water. '
    23: '²³ When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because
      it was bitter. That is why it was called Marah. '
    24: '²⁴ And the people complained against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” '
    25: "²⁵ He cried out to the Lord; and the Lord showed him a piece of wood; he\
      \ threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.\nThere the Lord made\
      \ for them a statute and an ordinance and there he put them to the test. "
    26: "²⁶ He said, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the Lord your God,\
      \ and do what is right in his sight, and give heed to his commandments and keep\
      \ all his statutes, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought\
      \ upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord who heals you.” \n"
    27: ²⁷ Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy
      palm trees; and they camped there by the water.
  16:
    1: '¹ The whole congregation of the Israelites set out from Elim; and Israel came
      to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth
      day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt. '
    2: '² The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron
      in the wilderness. '
    3: "³ The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the Lord\
      \ in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread;\
      \ for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly\
      \ with hunger.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you,
      and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that
      way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not. '
    5: '⁵ On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice
      as much as they gather on other days.” '
    6: '⁶ So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you shall
      know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, '
    7: '⁷ and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard
      your complaining against the Lord. For what are we, that you complain against
      us?” '
    8: "⁸ And Moses said, “When the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening and\
      \ your fill of bread in the morning, because the Lord has heard the complaining\
      \ that you utter against him—what are we? Your complaining is not against us\
      \ but against the Lord.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites,
      ‘Draw near to the Lord, for he has heard your complaining.’” '
    10: '¹⁰ And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked
      toward the wilderness, and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. '
    11: '¹¹ The Lord spoke to Moses and said, '
    12: "¹² “I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, ‘At twilight\
      \ you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread;\
      \ then you shall know that I am the Lord your God.’” \n"
    13: '¹³ In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning
      there was a layer of dew around the camp. '
    14: '¹⁴ When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was
      a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground. '
    15: '¹⁵ When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For
      they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the
      Lord has given you to eat. '
    16: '¹⁶ This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Gather as much of it as each of
      you needs, an omer to a person according to the number of persons, all providing
      for those in their own tents.’” '
    17: '¹⁷ The Israelites did so, some gathering more, some less. '
    18: '¹⁸ But when they measured it with an omer, those who gathered much had nothing
      over, and those who gathered little had no shortage; they gathered as much as
      each of them needed. '
    19: '¹⁹ And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over until morning.” '
    20: '²⁰ But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it until morning,
      and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses was angry with them. '
    21: "²¹ Morning by morning they gathered it, as much as each needed; but when\
      \ the sun grew hot, it melted. \n"
    22: '²² On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers apiece. When
      all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, '
    23: '²³ he said to them, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a
      day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord; bake what you want to bake and
      boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until
      morning.’” '
    24: '²⁴ So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did
      not become foul, and there were no worms in it. '
    25: '²⁵ Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the Lord; today you
      will not find it in the field. '
    26: "²⁶ Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath,\
      \ there will be none.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found
      none. '
    28: '²⁸ The Lord said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments
      and instructions? '
    29: '²⁹ See! The Lord has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he
      gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your
      place on the seventh day.” '
    30: "³⁰ So the people rested on the seventh day. \n"
    31: '³¹ The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white,
      and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. '
    32: '³² Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be
      kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which
      I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” '
    33: '³³ And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it,
      and place it before the Lord, to be kept throughout your generations.” '
    34: '³⁴ As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for
      safekeeping. '
    35: '³⁵ The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land;
      they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. '
    36: ³⁶ An omer is a tenth of an ephah.
  17:
    1: '¹ From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed
      by stages, as the Lord commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no
      water for the people to drink. '
    2: '² The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses
      said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the Lord?” '
    3: '³ But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against
      Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
      and livestock with thirst?” '
    4: '⁴ So Moses cried out to the Lord, “What shall I do with this people? They
      are almost ready to stone me.” '
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the
      elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck
      the Nile, and go. '
    6: '⁶ I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the
      rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did
      so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. '
    7: "⁷ He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled\
      \ and tested the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. '
    9: '⁹ Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some men for us and go out, fight with Amalek.
      Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses,
      Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. '
    11: '¹¹ Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered
      his hand, Amalek prevailed. '
    12: '¹² But Moses’ hands grew weary; so they took a stone and put it under him,
      and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the
      other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the sun set. '
    13: "¹³ And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write this as a reminder in a book and recite
      it in the hearing of Joshua: I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek
      from under heaven.” '
    15: '¹⁵ And Moses built an altar and called it, The Lord is my banner. '
    16: ¹⁶ He said, “A hand upon the banner of the Lord! The Lord will have war with
      Amalek from generation to generation.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God
      had done for Moses and for his people Israel, how the Lord had brought Israel
      out of Egypt. '
    2: '² After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro took
      her back, '
    3: '³ along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I
      have been an alien in a foreign land”), '
    4: '⁴ and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was
      my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”). '
    5: '⁵ Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came into the wilderness where Moses was encamped
      at the mountain of God, bringing Moses’ sons and wife to him. '
    6: '⁶ He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you,
      with your wife and her two sons.” '
    7: '⁷ Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed down and kissed him;
      each asked after the other’s welfare, and they went into the tent. '
    8: '⁸ Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh
      and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had beset them
      on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them. '
    9: "⁹ Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the Lord had done to Israel, in delivering\
      \ them from the Egyptians. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you from the Egyptians
      and from Pharaoh. '
    11: '¹¹ Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, because he delivered
      the people from the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them.” '
    12: "¹² And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices\
      \ to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’\
      \ father-in-law in the presence of God. \n"
    13: '¹³ The next day Moses sat as judge for the people, while the people stood
      around him from morning until evening. '
    14: '¹⁴ When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he
      said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone,
      while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?” '
    15: '¹⁵ Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire
      of God. '
    16: '¹⁶ When they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person
      and another, and I make known to them the statutes and instructions of God.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good. '
    18: '¹⁸ You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people with you.
      For the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now listen to me. I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You should
      represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases before God; '
    20: '²⁰ teach them the statutes and instructions and make known to them the way
      they are to go and the things they are to do. '
    21: '²¹ You should also look for able men among all the people, men who fear God,
      are trustworthy, and hate dishonest gain; set such men over them as officers
      over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. '
    22: '²² Let them sit as judges for the people at all times; let them bring every
      important case to you, but decide every minor case themselves. So it will be
      easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. '
    23: "²³ If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure,\
      \ and all these people will go to their home in peace.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. '
    25: '²⁵ Moses chose able men from all Israel and appointed them as heads over
      the people, as officers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. '
    26: '²⁶ And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses,
      but any minor case they decided themselves. '
    27: ²⁷ Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went off to his own country.
  19:
    1: '¹ On the third new moon after the Israelites had gone out of the land of Egypt,
      on that very day, they came into the wilderness of Sinai. '
    2: '² They had journeyed from Rephidim, entered the wilderness of Sinai, and camped
      in the wilderness; Israel camped there in front of the mountain. '
    3: '³ Then Moses went up to God; the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying,
      “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the Israelites: '
    4: '⁴ You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’
      wings and brought you to myself. '
    5: '⁵ Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my
      treasured possession out of all the peoples. Indeed, the whole earth is mine, '
    6: "⁶ but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation. These are\
      \ the words that you shall speak to the Israelites.” \n"
    7: '⁷ So Moses came, summoned the elders of the people, and set before them all
      these words that the Lord had commanded him. '
    8: '⁸ The people all answered as one: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we
      will do.” Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud,\
      \ in order that the people may hear when I speak with you and so trust you ever\
      \ after.”\nWhen Moses had told the words of the people to the Lord, "
    10: '¹⁰ the Lord said to Moses: “Go to the people and consecrate them today and
      tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes '
    11: '¹¹ and prepare for the third day, because on the third day the Lord will
      come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. '
    12: '¹² You shall set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful not
      to go up the mountain or to touch the edge of it. Any who touch the mountain
      shall be put to death. '
    13: '¹³ No hand shall touch them, but they shall be stoned or shot with arrows;
      whether animal or human being, they shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds
      a long blast, they may go up on the mountain.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So Moses went down from the mountain to the people. He consecrated the
      people, and they washed their clothes. '
    15: "¹⁵ And he said to the people, “Prepare for the third day; do not go near\
      \ a woman.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, as well
      as a thick cloud on the mountain, and a blast of a trumpet so loud that all
      the people who were in the camp trembled. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. They took their
      stand at the foot of the mountain. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the Lord had descended upon
      it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, while the whole mountain
      shook violently. '
    19: '¹⁹ As the blast of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses would speak
      and God would answer him in thunder. '
    20: '²⁰ When the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain,
      the Lord summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. '
    21: '²¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to break
      through to the Lord to look; otherwise many of them will perish. '
    22: '²² Even the priests who approach the Lord must consecrate themselves or the
      Lord will break out against them.” '
    23: '²³ Moses said to the Lord, “The people are not permitted to come up to Mount
      Sinai; for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and
      keep it holy.’” '
    24: '²⁴ The Lord said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you; but
      do not let either the priests or the people break through to come up to the
      Lord; otherwise he will break out against them.” '
    25: ²⁵ So Moses went down to the people and told them.
  20:
    1: "¹ Then God spoke all these words: \n"
    2: '² I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of
      the house of slavery; '
    3: "³ you shall have no other gods before me. \n"
    4: '⁴ You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything
      that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the
      water under the earth. '
    5: '⁵ You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God
      am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third
      and the fourth generation of those who reject me, '
    6: "⁶ but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love\
      \ me and keep my commandments. \n"
    7: "⁷ You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the\
      \ Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name. \n"
    8: '⁸ Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. '
    9: '⁹ Six days you shall labor and do all your work. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do
      any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock,
      or the alien resident in your towns. '
    11: "¹¹ For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that\
      \ is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath\
      \ day and consecrated it. \n"
    12: "¹² Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the\
      \ land that the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    13: "¹³ You shall not murder. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall not commit adultery. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall not steal. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s\
      \ wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs\
      \ to your neighbor. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of
      the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood
      at a distance, '
    19: '¹⁹ and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let
      God speak to us, or we will die.” '
    20: '²⁰ Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to
      test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.” '
    21: "²¹ Then the people stood at a distance, while Moses drew near to the thick\
      \ darkness where God was. \n"
    22: '²² The Lord said to Moses: Thus you shall say to the Israelites: “You have
      seen for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven. '
    23: '²³ You shall not make gods of silver alongside me, nor shall you make for
      yourselves gods of gold. '
    24: '²⁴ You need make for me only an altar of earth and sacrifice on it your burnt
      offerings and your offerings of well-being, your sheep and your oxen; in every
      place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you. '
    25: '²⁵ But if you make for me an altar of stone, do not build it of hewn stones;
      for if you use a chisel upon it you profane it. '
    26: ²⁶ You shall not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness may not
      be exposed on it.”
  21:
    1: "¹ These are the ordinances that you shall set before them: \n"
    2: '² When you buy a male Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, but in the seventh
      he shall go out a free person, without debt. '
    3: '³ If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then
      his wife shall go out with him. '
    4: '⁴ If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the
      wife and her children shall be her master’s and he shall go out alone. '
    5: '⁵ But if the slave declares, “I love my master, my wife, and my children;
      I will not go out a free person,” '
    6: "⁶ then his master shall bring him before God. He shall be brought to the door\
      \ or the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall\
      \ serve him for life. \n"
    7: '⁷ When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male
      slaves do. '
    8: '⁸ If she does not please her master, who designated her for himself, then
      he shall let her be redeemed; he shall have no right to sell her to a foreign
      people, since he has dealt unfairly with her. '
    9: '⁹ If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter. '
    10: '¹⁰ If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing,
      or marital rights of the first wife. '
    11: "¹¹ And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out without\
      \ debt, without payment of money. \n"
    12: '¹² Whoever strikes a person mortally shall be put to death. '
    13: '¹³ If it was not premeditated, but came about by an act of God, then I will
      appoint for you a place to which the killer may flee. '
    14: "¹⁴ But if someone willfully attacks and kills another by treachery, you shall\
      \ take the killer from my altar for execution. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Whoever strikes father or mother shall be put to death. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Whoever kidnaps a person, whether that person has been sold or is still\
      \ held in possession, shall be put to death. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Whoever curses father or mother shall be put to death. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ When individuals quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or fist
      so that the injured party, though not dead, is confined to bed, '
    19: "¹⁹ but recovers and walks around outside with the help of a staff, then the\
      \ assailant shall be free of liability, except to pay for the loss of time,\
      \ and to arrange for full recovery. \n"
    20: '²⁰ When a slaveowner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave
      dies immediately, the owner shall be punished. '
    21: "²¹ But if the slave survives a day or two, there is no punishment; for the\
      \ slave is the owner’s property. \n"
    22: '²² When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is
      a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be
      fined what the woman’s husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. '
    23: '²³ If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, '
    24: '²⁴ eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, '
    25: "²⁵ burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. \n"
    26: '²⁶ When a slaveowner strikes the eye of a male or female slave, destroying
      it, the owner shall let the slave go, a free person, to compensate for the eye. '
    27: "²⁷ If the owner knocks out a tooth of a male or female slave, the slave shall\
      \ be let go, a free person, to compensate for the tooth. \n"
    28: '²⁸ When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and
      its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall not be liable. '
    29: '²⁹ If the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been
      warned but has not restrained it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall
      be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. '
    30: '³⁰ If a ransom is imposed on the owner, then the owner shall pay whatever
      is imposed for the redemption of the victim’s life. '
    31: '³¹ If it gores a boy or a girl, the owner shall be dealt with according to
      this same rule. '
    32: "³² If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall pay to the slaveowner\
      \ thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. \n"
    33: '³³ If someone leaves a pit open, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and
      an ox or a donkey falls into it, '
    34: "³⁴ the owner of the pit shall make restitution, giving money to its owner,\
      \ but keeping the dead animal. \n"
    35: '³⁵ If someone’s ox hurts the ox of another, so that it dies, then they shall
      sell the live ox and divide the price of it; and the dead animal they shall
      also divide. '
    36: ³⁶ But if it was known that the ox was accustomed to gore in the past, and
      its owner has not restrained it, the owner shall restore ox for ox, but keep
      the dead animal.
  22:
    1: '¹ When someone steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, the
      thief shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. The thief shall
      make restitution, but if unable to do so, shall be sold for the theft. '
    2: "⁴ When the animal, whether ox or donkey or sheep, is found alive in the thief’s\
      \ possession, the thief shall pay double. \n"
    3: '² If a thief is found breaking in, and is beaten to death, no bloodguilt is
      incurred; '
    4: "³ but if it happens after sunrise, bloodguilt is incurred. \n"
    5: "⁵ When someone causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over, or lets livestock\
      \ loose to graze in someone else’s field, restitution shall be made from the\
      \ best in the owner’s field or vineyard. \n"
    6: "⁶ When fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or\
      \ the standing grain or the field is consumed, the one who started the fire\
      \ shall make full restitution. \n"
    7: '⁷ When someone delivers to a neighbor money or goods for safekeeping, and
      they are stolen from the neighbor’s house, then the thief, if caught, shall
      pay double. '
    8: "⁸ If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house shall be brought before\
      \ God, to determine whether or not the owner had laid hands on the neighbor’s\
      \ goods. \n"
    9: "⁹ In any case of disputed ownership involving ox, donkey, sheep, clothing,\
      \ or any other loss, of which one party says, “This is mine,” the case of both\

      \ to the other. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When someone delivers to another a donkey, ox, sheep, or any other animal
      for safekeeping, and it dies or is injured or is carried off, without anyone
      seeing it, '
    11: '¹¹ an oath before the Lord shall decide between the two of them that the
      one has not laid hands on the property of the other; the owner shall accept
      the oath, and no restitution shall be made. '
    12: '¹² But if it was stolen, restitution shall be made to its owner. '
    13: "¹³ If it was mangled by beasts, let it be brought as evidence; restitution\
      \ shall not be made for the mangled remains. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When someone borrows an animal from another and it is injured or dies,
      the owner not being present, full restitution shall be made. '
    15: "¹⁵ If the owner was present, there shall be no restitution; if it was hired,\
      \ only the hiring fee is due. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged to be married, and lies
      with her, he shall give the bride-price for her and make her his wife. '
    17: "¹⁷ But if her father refuses to give her to him, he shall pay an amount equal\

    18: "¹⁸ You shall not permit a female sorcerer to live. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Whoever sacrifices to any god, other than the Lord alone, shall be devoted\
      \ to destruction. \n"
    21: '²¹ You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien, for you were aliens in
      the land of Egypt. '
    22: '²² You shall not abuse any widow or orphan. '
    23: '²³ If you do abuse them, when they cry out to me, I will surely heed their

    25: '²⁵ If you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, you shall not deal

      \ for I am compassionate. \n"
    28: "²⁸ You shall not revile God, or curse a leader of your people. \n"

    31: ³¹ You shall be people consecrated to me; therefore you shall not eat any

    1: '¹ You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with the wicked

    2: '² You shall not follow a majority in wrongdoing; when you bear witness in

    4: "⁴ When you come upon your enemy’s ox or donkey going astray, you shall bring\

    10: '¹⁰ For six years you shall sow your land and gather in its yield; '

      the resident alien may be refreshed. '
    13: "¹³ Be attentive to all that I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of\
      \ other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Three times in the year you shall hold a festival for me. '
    15: "¹⁵ You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread; as I commanded you,\
      \ you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the\
      \ month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt.\nNo one shall appear before\
      \ me empty-handed. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ You shall observe the festival of harvest, of the first fruits of your
      labor, of what you sow in the field. You shall observe the festival of ingathering
      at the end of the year, when you gather in from the field the fruit of your
      labor. '
    17: "¹⁷ Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord God.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened,\
      \ or let the fat of my festival remain until the morning. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The choicest of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the\
      \ house of the Lord your God.\nYou shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ I am going to send an angel in front of you, to guard you on the way and
      to bring you to the place that I have prepared. '
    21: "²¹ Be attentive to him and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him,\
      \ for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him. \n"
    22: "²² But if you listen attentively to his voice and do all that I say, then\
      \ I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes. \n"
    23: '²³ When my angel goes in front of you, and brings you to the Amorites, the
      Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and
      I blot them out, '
    24: '²⁴ you shall not bow down to their gods, or worship them, or follow their
      practices, but you shall utterly demolish them and break their pillars in pieces. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall worship the Lord your God, and I will bless your bread and your
      water; and I will take sickness away from among you. '
    26: '²⁶ No one shall miscarry or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number
      of your days. '
    27: '²⁷ I will send my terror in front of you, and will throw into confusion all
      the people against whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn
      their backs to you. '
    28: '²⁸ And I will send the pestilence in front of you, which shall drive out
      the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you. '
    29: '²⁹ I will not drive them out from before you in one year, or the land would
      become desolate and the wild animals would multiply against you. '
    30: '³⁰ Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have
      increased and possess the land. '
    31: '³¹ I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines,
      and from the wilderness to the Euphrates; for I will hand over to you the inhabitants
      of the land, and you shall drive them out before you. '
    32: '³² You shall make no covenant with them and their gods. '
    33: ³³ They shall not live in your land, or they will make you sin against me;
      for if you worship their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.

    1: '¹ Then he said to Moses, “Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu,
      and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance. '
    2: "² Moses alone shall come near the Lord; but the others shall not come near,\
      \ and the people shall not come up with him.” \n"
    3: '³ Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances;
      and all the people answered with one voice, and said, “All the words that the
      Lord has spoken we will do.” '
    4: '⁴ And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning,
      and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars, corresponding
      to the twelve tribes of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ He sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and
      sacrificed oxen as offerings of well-being to the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood
      he dashed against the altar. '
    7: '⁷ Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the
      people; and they said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will
      be obedient.” '
    8: "⁸ Moses took the blood and dashed it on the people, and said, “See the blood\
      \ of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these\
      \ words.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel
      went up, '
    10: '¹⁰ and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like
      a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. '
    11: "¹¹ God did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; also\
      \ they beheld God, and they ate and drank. \n"
    12: '¹² The Lord said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there;
      and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment,
      which I have written for their instruction.” '
    13: '¹³ So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the
      mountain of God. '
    14: "¹⁴ To the elders he had said, “Wait here for us, until we come to you again;\
      \ for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. '
    16: '¹⁶ The glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it
      for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire
      on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. '
    18: ¹⁸ Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the
      mountain for forty days and forty nights.
  25:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses: '
    2: '² Tell the Israelites to take for me an offering; from all whose hearts prompt
      them to give you shall receive the offering for me. '
    3: '³ This is the offering that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and
      bronze, '
    4: '⁴ blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine linen, goats’ hair, '
    5: '⁵ tanned rams’ skins, fine leather, acacia wood, '
    6: '⁶ oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, '
    7: '⁷ onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and for the breastpiece. '
    8: '⁸ And have them make me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them. '
    9: "⁹ In accordance with all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle\
      \ and of all its furniture, so you shall make it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ They shall make an ark of acacia wood; it shall be two and a half cubits
      long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and outside you shall overlay
      it, and you shall make a molding of gold upon it all around. '
    12: '¹² You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet,
      two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side. '
    13: '¹³ You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. '
    14: '¹⁴ And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, by
      which to carry the ark. '
    15: '¹⁵ The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken
      from it. '
    16: "¹⁶ You shall put into the ark the covenant that I shall give you. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half shall
      be its length, and a cubit and a half its width. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall make two cherubim of gold; you shall make them of hammered work,
      at the two ends of the mercy seat. '
    19: '¹⁹ Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other; of one piece
      with the mercy seat you shall make the cherubim at its two ends. '
    20: '²⁰ The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy
      seat with their wings. They shall face one to another; the faces of the cherubim
      shall be turned toward the mercy seat. '
    21: '²¹ You shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you
      shall put the covenant that I shall give you. '
    22: "²² There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between\
      \ the two cherubim that are on the ark of the covenant, I will deliver to you\
      \ all my commands for the Israelites. \n"
    23: '²³ You shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide,
      and a cubit and a half high. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold around
      it. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall make around it a rim a handbreadth wide, and a molding of gold
      around the rim. '
    26: '²⁶ You shall make for it four rings of gold, and fasten the rings to the
      four corners at its four legs. '
    27: '²⁷ The rings that hold the poles used for carrying the table shall be close
      to the rim. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, and
      the table shall be carried with these. '
    29: '²⁹ You shall make its plates and dishes for incense, and its flagons and
      bowls with which to pour drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold. '
    30: "³⁰ And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before me always.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The base and the shaft of the
      lampstand shall be made of hammered work; its cups, its calyxes, and its petals
      shall be of one piece with it; '
    32: '³² and there shall be six branches going out of its sides, three branches

      one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and
      petals, on the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. '
    34: '³⁴ On the lampstand itself there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms,
      each with its calyxes and petals. '
    35: '³⁵ There shall be a calyx of one piece with it under the first pair of branches,
      a calyx of one piece with it under the next pair of branches, and a calyx of
      one piece with it under the last pair of branches—so for the six branches that
      go out of the lampstand. '
    36: '³⁶ Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole
      of it one hammered piece of pure gold. '
    37: '³⁷ You shall make the seven lamps for it; and the lamps shall be set up so
      as to give light on the space in front of it. '
    38: '³⁸ Its snuffers and trays shall be of pure gold. '
    39: '³⁹ It, and all these utensils, shall be made from a talent of pure gold. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And see that you make them according to the pattern for them, which is
      being shown you on the mountain.
  26:
    1: '¹ Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twisted

      with a blue cord, so that it may lie on the decorated band of the ephod, and
      so that the breastpiece shall not come loose from the ephod. '
    29: '²⁹ So Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece
      of judgment on his heart when he goes into the holy place, for a continual remembrance
      before the Lord. '
    30: "³⁰ In the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim and the Thummim,\
      \ and they shall be on Aaron’s heart when he goes in before the Lord; thus Aaron\
      \ shall bear the judgment of the Israelites on his heart before the Lord continually.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue. '
    32: '³² It shall have an opening for the head in the middle of it, with a woven
      binding around the opening, like the opening in a coat of mail, so that it may
      not be torn. '
    33: '³³ On its lower hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and crimson
      yarns, all around the lower hem, with bells of gold between them all around— '
    34: '³⁴ a golden bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the lower hem of
      the robe. '
    35: "³⁵ Aaron shall wear it when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when\
      \ he goes into the holy place before the Lord, and when he comes out, so that\
      \ he may not die. \n"
    36: '³⁶ You shall make a rosette of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engraving
      of a signet, “Holy to the Lord.” '
    37: '³⁷ You shall fasten it on the turban with a blue cord; it shall be on the
      front of the turban. '
    38: "³⁸ It shall be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall take on himself any guilt\
      \ incurred in the holy offering that the Israelites consecrate as their sacred\
      \ donations; it shall always be on his forehead, in order that they may find\
      \ favor before the Lord. \n"
    39: "³⁹ You shall make the checkered tunic of fine linen, and you shall make a\
      \ turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash embroidered with needlework.\
      \ \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ For Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics and sashes and headdresses; you
      shall make them for their glorious adornment. '
    41: '⁴¹ You shall put them on your brother Aaron, and on his sons with him, and
      shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them, so that they may serve
      me as priests. '
    42: '⁴² You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh;
      they shall reach from the hips to the thighs; '
    43: ⁴³ Aaron and his sons shall wear them when they go into the tent of meeting,
      or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place; or they will
      bring guilt on themselves and die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him
      and for his descendants after him.
  29:
    1: '¹ Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, so that they may
      serve me as priests. Take one young bull and two rams without blemish, '
    2: '² and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers
      spread with oil. You shall make them of choice wheat flour. '
    3: '³ You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, and bring
      the bull and the two rams. '
    4: '⁴ You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
      and wash them with water. '
    5: '⁵ Then you shall take the vestments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe
      of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with the decorated
      band of the ephod; '
    6: '⁶ and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy diadem on the
      turban. '
    7: '⁷ You shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head and anoint him. '
    8: '⁸ Then you shall bring his sons, and put tunics on them, '
    9: "⁹ and you shall gird them with sashes and tie headdresses on them; and the\
      \ priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual ordinance. You shall then ordain\
      \ Aaron and his sons. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ You shall bring the bull in front of the tent of meeting. Aaron and his
      sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull, '
    11: '¹¹ and you shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, at the entrance of the
      tent of meeting, '
    12: '¹² and shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of
      the altar with your finger, and all the rest of the blood you shall pour out
      at the base of the altar. '
    13: '¹³ You shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage
      of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and turn them
      into smoke on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn\
      \ with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay
      their hands on the head of the ram, '
    16: '¹⁶ and you shall slaughter the ram, and shall take its blood and dash it
      against all sides of the altar. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then you shall cut the ram into its parts, and wash its entrails and its
      legs, and put them with its parts and its head, '
    18: "¹⁸ and turn the whole ram into smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering\
      \ to the Lord; it is a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the Lord. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands
      on the head of the ram, '
    20: '²⁰ and you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it
      on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the lobes of the right ears of his sons,
      and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet,
      and dash the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar. '
    21: "²¹ Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of\
      \ the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his vestments and on his sons\
      \ and his sons’ vestments with him; then he and his vestments shall be holy,\
      \ as well as his sons and his sons’ vestments. \n"
    22: '²² You shall also take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers
      the entrails, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat that
      is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination), '
    23: '²³ and one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer,
      out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before the Lord; '
    24: '²⁴ and you shall place all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of
      his sons, and raise them as an elevation offering before the Lord. '
    25: "²⁵ Then you shall take them from their hands, and turn them into smoke on\
      \ the altar on top of the burnt offering of pleasing odor before the Lord; it\
      \ is an offering by fire to the Lord. \n"
    26: '²⁶ You shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination and raise it
      as an elevation offering before the Lord; and it shall be your portion. '
    27: '²⁷ You shall consecrate the breast that was raised as an elevation offering
      and the thigh that was raised as an elevation offering from the ram of ordination,
      from that which belonged to Aaron and his sons. '
    28: "²⁸ These things shall be a perpetual ordinance for Aaron and his sons from\
      \ the Israelites, for this is an offering; and it shall be an offering by the\
      \ Israelites from their sacrifice of offerings of well-being, their offering\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    29: '²⁹ The sacred vestments of Aaron shall be passed on to his sons after him;
      they shall be anointed in them and ordained in them. '
    30: "³⁰ The son who is priest in his place shall wear them seven days, when he\
      \ comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. \n"
    31: '³¹ You shall take the ram of ordination, and boil its flesh in a holy place; '
    32: '³² and Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that
      is in the basket, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. '
    33: '³³ They themselves shall eat the food by which atonement is made, to ordain
      and consecrate them, but no one else shall eat of them, because they are holy. '
    34: "³⁴ If any of the flesh for the ordination, or of the bread, remains until\
      \ the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be\
      \ eaten, because it is holy. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, just as I have commanded you;
      through seven days you shall ordain them. '
    36: '³⁶ Also every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement.
      Also you shall offer a sin offering for the altar, when you make atonement for
      it, and shall anoint it, to consecrate it. '
    37: "³⁷ Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and consecrate it,\
      \ and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar shall become\
      \ holy. \n"
    38: '³⁸ Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old regularly
      each day. '
    39: '³⁹ One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall
      offer in the evening; '
    40: '⁴⁰ and with the first lamb one-tenth of a measure of choice flour mixed with
      one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink
      offering. '
    41: '⁴¹ And the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, and shall offer with
      it a grain offering and its drink offering, as in the morning, for a pleasing
      odor, an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    42: '⁴² It shall be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the
      entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord, where I will meet with you,
      to speak to you there. '
    43: '⁴³ I will meet with the Israelites there, and it shall be sanctified by my
      glory; '
    44: '⁴⁴ I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; Aaron also and his
      sons I will consecrate, to serve me as priests. '
    45: '⁴⁵ I will dwell among the Israelites, and I will be their God. '
    46: ⁴⁶ And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them out
      of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them; I am the Lord their God.
  30:
    1: '¹ You shall make an altar on which to offer incense; you shall make it of
      acacia wood. '
    2: '² It shall be one cubit long, and one cubit wide; it shall be square, and
      shall be two cubits high; its horns shall be of one piece with it. '
    3: '³ You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides all around and
      its horns; and you shall make for it a molding of gold all around. '
    4: '⁴ And you shall make two golden rings for it; under its molding on two opposite
      sides of it you shall make them, and they shall hold the poles with which to
      carry it. '
    5: '⁵ You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. '
    6: '⁶ You shall place it in front of the curtain that is above the ark of the
      covenant, in front of the mercy seat that is over the covenant, where I will
      meet with you. '
    7: '⁷ Aaron shall offer fragrant incense on it; every morning when he dresses
      the lamps he shall offer it, '
    8: '⁸ and when Aaron sets up the lamps in the evening, he shall offer it, a regular
      incense offering before the Lord throughout your generations. '
    9: '⁹ You shall not offer unholy incense on it, or a burnt offering, or a grain
      offering; and you shall not pour a drink offering on it. '
    10: "¹⁰ Once a year Aaron shall perform the rite of atonement on its horns. Throughout\
      \ your generations he shall perform the atonement for it once a year with the\
      \ blood of the atoning sin offering. It is most holy to the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    12: '¹² When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, at registration
      all of them shall give a ransom for their lives to the Lord, so that no plague
      may come upon them for being registered. '
    13: '¹³ This is what each one who is registered shall give: half a shekel according
      to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel
      as an offering to the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ Each one who is registered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give
      the Lord’s offering. '
    15: '¹⁵ The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the
      half shekel, when you bring this offering to the Lord to make atonement for
      your lives. '
    16: "¹⁶ You shall take the atonement money from the Israelites and shall designate\
      \ it for the service of the tent of meeting; before the Lord it will be a reminder\
      \ to the Israelites of the ransom given for your lives. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. You shall
      put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in
      it; '
    19: '¹⁹ with the water Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet. '
    20: '²⁰ When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar
      to minister, to make an offering by fire to the Lord, they shall wash with water,
      so that they may not die. '
    21: "²¹ They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die:\
      \ it shall be a perpetual ordinance for them, for him and for his descendants\
      \ throughout their generations. \n"
    22: '²² The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    23: '²³ Take the finest spices: of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet-smelling
      cinnamon half as much, that is, two hundred fifty, and two hundred fifty of
      aromatic cane, '
    24: '²⁴ and five hundred of cassia—measured by the sanctuary shekel—and a hin
      of olive oil; '
    25: '²⁵ and you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the perfumer;
      it shall be a holy anointing oil. '
    26: '²⁶ With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the covenant, '
    27: '²⁷ and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils,
      and the altar of incense, '
    28: '²⁸ and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with
      its stand; '
    29: '²⁹ you shall consecrate them, so that they may be most holy; whatever touches
      them will become holy. '
    30: '³⁰ You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, in order that
      they may serve me as priests. '
    31: '³¹ You shall say to the Israelites, “This shall be my holy anointing oil
      throughout your generations. '
    32: '³² It shall not be used in any ordinary anointing of the body, and you shall
      make no other like it in composition; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you. '
    33: "³³ Whoever compounds any like it or whoever puts any of it on an unqualified\
      \ person shall be cut off from the people.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ The Lord said to Moses: Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum,
      sweet spices with pure frankincense (an equal part of each), '
    35: '³⁵ and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure
      and holy; '
    36: '³⁶ and you shall beat some of it into powder, and put part of it before the
      covenant in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with you; it shall be for
      you most holy. '
    37: '³⁷ When you make incense according to this composition, you shall not make
      it for yourselves; it shall be regarded by you as holy to the Lord. '
    38: ³⁸ Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume shall be cut off from the people.
  31:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    2: '² See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of
      Judah: '
    3: '³ and I have filled him with divine spirit, with ability, intelligence, and
      knowledge in every kind of craft, '
    4: '⁴ to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, '
    5: '⁵ in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, in every kind of craft. '
    6: '⁶ Moreover, I have appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe
      of Dan; and I have given skill to all the skillful, so that they may make all
      that I have commanded you: '
    7: '⁷ the tent of meeting, and the ark of the covenant, and the mercy seat that
      is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent, '
    8: '⁸ the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils,
      and the altar of incense, '
    9: '⁹ and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with
      its stand, '
    10: '¹⁰ and the finely worked vestments, the holy vestments for the priest Aaron
      and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests, '
    11: "¹¹ and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the holy place. They\
      \ shall do just as I have commanded you. \n"
    12: '¹² The Lord said to Moses: '
    13: '¹³ You yourself are to speak to the Israelites: “You shall keep my sabbaths,
      for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, given in
      order that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall keep the sabbath, because it is holy for you; everyone who profanes
      it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on it shall be cut off from
      among the people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn
      rest, holy to the Lord; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall be put
      to death. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore the Israelites shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath
      throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant. '
    17: "¹⁷ It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days\
      \ the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was\
      \ refreshed.” \n"
    18: ¹⁸ When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two
      tablets of the covenant, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
  32:
    1: '¹ When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the
      people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make gods for us, who
      shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the
      land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” '
    2: '² Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your
      wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” '
    3: '³ So all the people took off the gold rings from their ears, and brought them
      to Aaron. '
    4: '⁴ He took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a
      calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out
      of the land of Egypt!” '
    5: '⁵ When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation
      and said, “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord.” '
    6: "⁶ They rose early the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought sacrifices\
      \ of well-being; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ The Lord said to Moses, “Go down at once! Your people, whom you brought
      up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely; '
    8: '⁸ they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they
      have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed
      to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the
      land of Egypt!’” '
    9: '⁹ The Lord said to Moses, “I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they
      are. '
    10: "¹⁰ Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may\
      \ consume them; and of you I will make a great nation.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ But Moses implored the Lord his God, and said, “O Lord, why does your
      wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt
      with great power and with a mighty hand? '
    12: '¹² Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought
      them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of
      the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster
      on your people. '
    13: '¹³ Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them
      by your own self, saying to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the
      stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your
      descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’” '
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring\
      \ on his people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets
      of the covenant in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, written
      on the front and on the back. '
    16: '¹⁶ The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God,
      engraved upon the tablets. '
    17: '¹⁷ When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to
      Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.” '
    18: "¹⁸ But he said,\n“It is not the sound made by victors,\nor the sound made\
      \ by losers;\nit is the sound of revelers that I hear.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ As soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses’
      anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and broke them at
      the foot of the mountain. '
    20: "²⁰ He took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to\
      \ powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it. \n"
    21: '²¹ Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought
      so great a sin upon them?” '
    22: '²² And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the
      people, that they are bent on evil. '
    23: '²³ They said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses,
      the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has
      become of him.’ '
    24: "²⁴ So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off’; so they gave it to\
      \ me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!” \n"
    25: '²⁵ When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them
      run wild, to the derision of their enemies), '
    26: '²⁶ then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the Lord’s
      side? Come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him. '
    27: '²⁷ He said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Put your sword
      on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the
      camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.’” '
    28: '²⁸ The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the
      people fell on that day. '
    29: "²⁹ Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the\
      \ Lord, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing\
      \ on yourselves this day.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin.
      But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” '
    31: '³¹ So Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Alas, this people has sinned
      a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold. '
    32: '³² But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, blot me out of
      the book that you have written.” '
    33: '³³ But the Lord said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot
      out of my book. '
    34: "³⁴ But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to\
      \ you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes\
      \ for punishment, I will punish them for their sin.” \n"
    35: ³⁵ Then the Lord sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf—the
      one that Aaron made.
  33:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, “Go, leave this place, you and the people whom you
      have brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land of which I swore
      to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’ '
    2: '² I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the
      Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. '
    3: "³ Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among\
      \ you, or I would consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ When the people heard these harsh words, they mourned, and no one put on
      ornaments. '
    5: '⁵ For the Lord had said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked
      people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you.
      So now take off your ornaments, and I will decide what to do to you.’” '
    6: "⁶ Therefore the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount\
      \ Horeb onward. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from
      the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the Lord
      would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. '
    8: '⁸ Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand,
      each of them, at the entrance of their tents and watch Moses until he had gone
      into the tent. '
    9: '⁹ When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand
      at the entrance of the tent, and the Lord would speak with Moses. '
    10: '¹⁰ When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of
      the tent, all the people would rise and bow down, all of them, at the entrance
      of their tent. '
    11: "¹¹ Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a\
      \ friend. Then he would return to the camp; but his young assistant, Joshua\
      \ son of Nun, would not leave the tent. \n"
    12: '¹² Moses said to the Lord, “See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’;
      but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said,
      ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’ '
    13: '¹³ Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I
      may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is
      your people.” '
    14: '¹⁴ He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” '
    15: '¹⁵ And he said to him, “If your presence will not go, do not carry us up
      from here. '
    16: "¹⁶ For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and\
      \ your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and\
      \ your people, from every people on the face of the earth.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked;
      for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.” '
    19: '¹⁹ And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim
      before you the name, ‘The Lord’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
      and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. '
    20: '²⁰ But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.” '
    21: '²¹ And the Lord continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand
      on the rock; '
    22: '²² and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and
      I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; '
    23: ²³ then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall
      not be seen.”
  34:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones,
      and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which
      you broke. '
    2: '² Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present
      yourself there to me, on the top of the mountain. '
    3: '³ No one shall come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout
      all the mountain; and do not let flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.” '
    4: '⁴ So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the former ones; and he rose early
      in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and
      took in his hand the two tablets of stone. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed
      the name, “The Lord.” '
    6: "⁶ The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed,\n“The Lord, the Lord,\na God\
      \ merciful and gracious,\nslow to anger,\nand abounding in steadfast love and\
      \ faithfulness,\n"
    7: "⁷ keeping steadfast love for the thousandth generation,\nforgiving iniquity\
      \ and transgression and sin,\nyet by no means clearing the guilty,\nbut visiting\
      \ the iniquity of the parents\nupon the children\nand the children’s children,\n\
      to the third and the fourth generation.” \n"
    8: '⁸ And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. '
    9: "⁹ He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the\
      \ Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity\
      \ and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He said: I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform\
      \ marvels, such as have not been performed in all the earth or in any nation;\
      \ and all the people among whom you live shall see the work of the Lord; for\
      \ it is an awesome thing that I will do with you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Observe what I command you today. See, I will drive out before you the
      Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
      Jebusites. '
    12: '¹² Take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which
      you are going, or it will become a snare among you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their
      sacred poles '
    14: '¹⁴ (for you shall worship no other god, because the Lord, whose name is Jealous,
      is a jealous God). '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when
      they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone
      among them will invite you, and you will eat of the sacrifice. '
    16: "¹⁶ And you will take wives from among their daughters for your sons, and\
      \ their daughters who prostitute themselves to their gods will make your sons\
      \ also prostitute themselves to their gods. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You shall not make cast idols. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall\
      \ eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month\
      \ of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn
      of cow and sheep. '
    20: "²⁰ The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will\
      \ not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you\
      \ shall redeem.\nNo one shall appear before me empty-handed. \n"
    21: '²¹ Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in
      plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest. '
    22: '²² You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest,
      and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year. '
    23: '²³ Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord God,
      the God of Israel. '
    24: "²⁴ For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one\
      \ shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three\
      \ times in the year. \n"
    25: "²⁵ You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice\
      \ of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning. \n"
    26: "²⁶ The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house\
      \ of the Lord your God.\nYou shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk. \n"
    27: '²⁷ The Lord said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words
      I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. '
    28: "²⁸ He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate\
      \ bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant,\
      \ the ten commandments. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with
      the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin
      of his face shone because he had been talking with God. '
    30: '³⁰ When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was
      shining, and they were afraid to come near him. '
    31: '³¹ But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation
      returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. '
    32: '³² Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment
      all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. '
    33: '³³ When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; '
    34: '³⁴ but whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would
      take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites
      what he had been commanded, '
    35: ³⁵ the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was
      shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to
      speak with him.
  35:
    1: "¹ Moses assembled all the congregation of the Israelites and said to them:\
      \ These are the things that the Lord has commanded you to do: \n"
    2: '² Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy
      sabbath of solemn rest to the Lord; whoever does any work on it shall be put
      to death. '
    3: "³ You shall kindle no fire in all your dwellings on the sabbath day. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses said to all the congregation of the Israelites: This is the thing
      that the Lord has commanded: '
    5: '⁵ Take from among you an offering to the Lord; let whoever is of a generous
      heart bring the Lord’s offering: gold, silver, and bronze; '
    6: '⁶ blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine linen; goats’ hair, '
    7: '⁷ tanned rams’ skins, and fine leather; acacia wood, '
    8: '⁸ oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, '
    9: "⁹ and onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ All who are skillful among you shall come and make all that the Lord has
      commanded: the tabernacle, '
    11: '¹¹ its tent and its covering, its clasps and its frames, its bars, its pillars,
      and its bases; '
    12: '¹² the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain for the screen; '
    13: '¹³ the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; '
    14: '¹⁴ the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and
      the oil for the light; '
    15: '¹⁵ and the altar of incense, with its poles, and the anointing oil and the
      fragrant incense, and the screen for the entrance, the entrance of the tabernacle; '
    16: '¹⁶ the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and
      all its utensils, the basin with its stand; '
    17: '¹⁷ the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for
      the gate of the court; '
    18: '¹⁸ the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords; '
    19: "¹⁹ the finely worked vestments for ministering in the holy place, the holy\
      \ vestments for the priest Aaron, and the vestments of his sons, for their service\
      \ as priests. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then all the congregation of the Israelites withdrew from the presence
      of Moses. '
    21: '²¹ And they came, everyone whose heart was stirred, and everyone whose spirit
      was willing, and brought the Lord’s offering to be used for the tent of meeting,
      and for all its service, and for the sacred vestments. '
    22: '²² So they came, both men and women; all who were of a willing heart brought
      brooches and earrings and signet rings and pendants, all sorts of gold objects,
      everyone bringing an offering of gold to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ And everyone who possessed blue or purple or crimson yarn or fine linen
      or goats’ hair or tanned rams’ skins or fine leather, brought them. '
    24: '²⁴ Everyone who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as
      the Lord’s offering; and everyone who possessed acacia wood of any use in the
      work, brought it. '
    25: '²⁵ All the skillful women spun with their hands, and brought what they had
      spun in blue and purple and crimson yarns and fine linen; '
    26: '²⁶ all the women whose hearts moved them to use their skill spun the goats’
      hair. '
    27: '²⁷ And the leaders brought onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and
      the breastpiece, '
    28: '²⁸ and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the
      fragrant incense. '
    29: "²⁹ All the Israelite men and women whose hearts made them willing to bring\
      \ anything for the work that the Lord had commanded by Moses to be done, brought\
      \ it as a freewill offering to the Lord. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Moses said to the Israelites: See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel
      son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; '
    31: '³¹ he has filled him with divine spirit, with skill, intelligence, and knowledge
      in every kind of craft, '
    32: '³² to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, '
    33: '³³ in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, in every kind of craft. '
    34: '³⁴ And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach,
      of the tribe of Dan. '
    35: ³⁵ He has filled them with skill to do every kind of work done by an artisan
      or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and
      in fine linen, or by a weaver—by any sort of artisan or skilled designer.
  36:
    1: "¹ Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the Lord has given skill\
      \ and understanding to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary\
      \ shall work in accordance with all that the Lord has commanded. \n"
    2: '² Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful one to whom the
      Lord had given skill, everyone whose heart was stirred to come to do the work; '
    3: '³ and they received from Moses all the freewill offerings that the Israelites
      had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him
      freewill offerings every morning, '
    4: '⁴ so that all the artisans who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary
      came, each from the task being performed, '
    5: '⁵ and said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for doing
      the work that the Lord has commanded us to do.” '
    6: '⁶ So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp: “No
      man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So
      the people were restrained from bringing; '
    7: "⁷ for what they had already brought was more than enough to do all the work.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ All those with skill among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains;
      they were made of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns, with
      cherubim skillfully worked into them. '
    9: "⁹ The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each\
      \ curtain four cubits; all the curtains were of the same size. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ He joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he
      joined to one another. '
    11: '¹¹ He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first
      set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second
      set; '
    12: '¹² he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the
      edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one
      another. '
    13: "¹³ And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains one to the other\
      \ with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He also made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he
      made eleven curtains. '
    15: '¹⁵ The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain
      four cubits; the eleven curtains were of the same size. '
    16: '¹⁶ He joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. '
    17: '¹⁷ He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set,
      and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain. '
    18: '¹⁸ He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it might
      be one whole. '
    19: "¹⁹ And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams’ skins and an outer\
      \ covering of fine leather. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood. '
    21: '²¹ Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the width
      of each frame. '
    22: '²² Each frame had two pegs for fitting together; he did this for all the
      frames of the tabernacle. '
    23: '²³ The frames for the tabernacle he made in this way: twenty frames for the
      south side; '
    24: '²⁴ and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under
      the first frame for its two pegs, and two bases under the next frame for its
      two pegs. '
    25: '²⁵ For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty
      frames '
    26: '²⁶ and their forty bases of silver, two bases under the first frame and two
      bases under the next frame. '
    27: '²⁷ For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames. '
    28: '²⁸ He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear. '
    29: '²⁹ They were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring;
      he made two of them in this way, for the two corners. '
    30: "³⁰ There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under\
      \ every frame two bases. \n"
    31: '³¹ He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the
      tabernacle, '
    32: '³² and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and
      five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward. '
    33: '³³ He made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the
      frames. '
    34: "³⁴ And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made rings of gold for them\
      \ to hold the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. \n"
    35: '³⁵ He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine twisted
      linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it. '
    36: '³⁶ For it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their
      hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver. '
    37: '³⁷ He also made a screen for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple, and
      crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, embroidered with needlework; '
    38: ³⁸ and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their
      bases with gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
  37:
    1: '¹ Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; it was two and a half cubits long,
      a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. '
    2: '² He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of
      gold around it. '
    3: '³ He cast for it four rings of gold for its four feet, two rings on its one
      side and two rings on its other side. '
    4: '⁴ He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, '
    5: '⁵ and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark. '
    6: '⁶ He made a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half was its length,
      and a cubit and a half its width. '
    7: '⁷ He made two cherubim of hammered gold; at the two ends of the mercy seat
      he made them, '
    8: '⁸ one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece
      with the mercy seat he made the cherubim at its two ends. '
    9: "⁹ The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat\
      \ with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were turned\
      \ toward the mercy seat. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ He also made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide,
      and a cubit and a half high. '
    11: '¹¹ He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it. '
    12: '¹² He made around it a rim a handbreadth wide, and made a molding of gold
      around the rim. '
    13: '¹³ He cast for it four rings of gold, and fastened the rings to the four
      corners at its four legs. '
    14: '¹⁴ The rings that held the poles used for carrying the table were close to
      the rim. '
    15: '¹⁵ He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them
      with gold. '
    16: "¹⁶ And he made the vessels of pure gold that were to be on the table, its\
      \ plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour\
      \ drink offerings. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ He also made the lampstand of pure gold. The base and the shaft of the
      lampstand were made of hammered work; its cups, its calyxes, and its petals
      were of one piece with it. '
    18: '¹⁸ There were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the
      lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the
      other side of it; '
    19: '¹⁹ three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on
      one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and
      petals, on the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. '
    20: '²⁰ On the lampstand itself there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms,
      each with its calyxes and petals. '
    21: '²¹ There was a calyx of one piece with it under the first pair of branches,
      a calyx of one piece with it under the next pair of branches, and a calyx of
      one piece with it under the last pair of branches. '
    22: '²² Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it, the whole
      of it one hammered piece of pure gold. '
    23: '²³ He made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. '
    24: "²⁴ He made it and all its utensils of a talent of pure gold. \n"
    25: '²⁵ He made the altar of incense of acacia wood, one cubit long, and one cubit
      wide; it was square, and was two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with
      it. '
    26: '²⁶ He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides all around, and
      its horns; and he made for it a molding of gold all around, '
    27: '²⁷ and made two golden rings for it under its molding, on two opposite sides
      of it, to hold the poles with which to carry it. '
    28: "²⁸ And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. \n"
    29: ²⁹ He made the holy anointing oil also, and the pure fragrant incense, blended
      as by the perfumer.
  38:
    1: '¹ He made the altar of burnt offering also of acacia wood; it was five cubits
      long, and five cubits wide; it was square, and three cubits high. '
    2: '² He made horns for it on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with
      it, and he overlaid it with bronze. '
    3: '³ He made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins,
      the forks, and the firepans: all its utensils he made of bronze. '
    4: '⁴ He made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, under its ledge, extending
      halfway down. '
    5: '⁵ He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grating to hold the
      poles; '
    6: '⁶ he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. '
    7: "⁷ And he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry\
      \ it with them; he made it hollow, with boards. \n"
    8: "⁸ He made the basin of bronze with its stand of bronze, from the mirrors of\
      \ the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. \n"
    9: '⁹ He made the court; for the south side the hangings of the court were of
      fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long; '
    10: '¹⁰ its twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks
      of the pillars and their bands were of silver. '
    11: '¹¹ For the north side there were hangings one hundred cubits long; its twenty
      pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars
      and their bands were of silver. '
    12: '¹² For the west side there were hangings fifty cubits long, with ten pillars
      and ten bases; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. '
    13: '¹³ And for the front to the east, fifty cubits. '
    14: '¹⁴ The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with three
      pillars and three bases. '
    15: '¹⁵ And so for the other side; on each side of the gate of the court were
      hangings of fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases. '
    16: '¹⁶ All the hangings around the court were of fine twisted linen. '
    17: '¹⁷ The bases for the pillars were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars
      and their bands were of silver; the overlaying of their capitals was also of
      silver, and all the pillars of the court were banded with silver. '
    18: '¹⁸ The screen for the entrance to the court was embroidered with needlework
      in blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine twisted linen. It was twenty cubits
      long and, along the width of it, five cubits high, corresponding to the hangings
      of the court. '
    19: '¹⁹ There were four pillars; their four bases were of bronze, their hooks
      of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their bands of silver. '
    20: "²⁰ All the pegs for the tabernacle and for the court all around were of bronze.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ These are the records of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant,
      which were drawn up at the commandment of Moses, the work of the Levites being
      under the direction of Ithamar son of the priest Aaron. '
    22: '²² Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the
      Lord commanded Moses; '
    23: "²³ and with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, engraver,\
      \ designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and in fine\
      \ linen. \n"
    24: '²⁴ All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the
      sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred
      thirty shekels, measured by the sanctuary shekel. '
    25: '²⁵ The silver from those of the congregation who were counted was one hundred
      talents and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, measured by the
      sanctuary shekel; '
    26: '²⁶ a beka a head (that is, half a shekel, measured by the sanctuary shekel),
      for everyone who was counted in the census, from twenty years old and upward,
      for six hundred three thousand, five hundred fifty men. '
    27: '²⁷ The hundred talents of silver were for casting the bases of the sanctuary,
      and the bases of the curtain; one hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent
      for a base. '
    28: '²⁸ Of the thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the
      pillars, and overlaid their capitals and made bands for them. '
    29: '²⁹ The bronze that was contributed was seventy talents, and two thousand
      four hundred shekels; '
    30: '³⁰ with it he made the bases for the entrance of the tent of meeting, the
      bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar, '
    31: ³¹ the bases all around the court, and the bases of the gate of the court,
      all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs around the court.
  39:
    1: "¹ Of the blue, purple, and crimson yarns they made finely worked vestments,\
      \ for ministering in the holy place; they made the sacred vestments for Aaron;\
      \ as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    2: '² He made the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine
      twisted linen. '
    3: '³ Gold leaf was hammered out and cut into threads to work into the blue, purple,
      and crimson yarns and into the fine twisted linen, in skilled design. '
    4: '⁴ They made for the ephod shoulder-pieces, joined to it at its two edges. '
    5: "⁵ The decorated band on it was of the same materials and workmanship, of gold,\
      \ of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen; as the Lord\
      \ had commanded Moses. \n"
    6: '⁶ The onyx stones were prepared, enclosed in settings of gold filigree and
      engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons
      of Israel. '
    7: "⁷ He set them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance\
      \ for the sons of Israel; as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    8: '⁸ He made the breastpiece, in skilled work, like the work of the ephod, of
      gold, of blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen. '
    9: '⁹ It was square; the breastpiece was made double, a span in length and a span
      in width when doubled. '
    10: '¹⁰ They set in it four rows of stones. A row of carnelian, chrysolite, and
      emerald was the first row; '
    11: '¹¹ and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a moonstone; '
    12: '¹² and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; '
    13: '¹³ and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were enclosed
      in settings of gold filigree. '
    14: '¹⁴ There were twelve stones with names corresponding to the names of the
      sons of Israel; they were like signets, each engraved with its name, for the
      twelve tribes. '
    15: '¹⁵ They made on the breastpiece chains of pure gold, twisted like cords; '
    16: '¹⁶ and they made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put
      the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece; '
    17: '¹⁷ and they put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the
      breastpiece. '
    18: '¹⁸ Two ends of the two cords they had attached to the two settings of filigree;
      in this way they attached it in front to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then they made two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the
      breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod. '
    20: '²⁰ They made two rings of gold, and attached them in front to the lower part
      of the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its joining above the decorated
      band of the ephod. '
    21: "²¹ They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with\
      \ a blue cord, so that it should lie on the decorated band of the ephod, and\
      \ that the breastpiece should not come loose from the ephod; as the Lord had\
      \ commanded Moses. \n"
    22: '²² He also made the robe of the ephod woven all of blue yarn; '
    23: '²³ and the opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening in
      a coat of mail, with a binding around the opening, so that it might not be torn. '
    24: '²⁴ On the lower hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and
      crimson yarns, and of fine twisted linen. '
    25: '²⁵ They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates
      on the lower hem of the robe all around, between the pomegranates; '
    26: "²⁶ a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate all around on the lower\
      \ hem of the robe for ministering; as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    27: '²⁷ They also made the tunics, woven of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons, '
    28: '²⁸ and the turban of fine linen, and the headdresses of fine linen, and the
      linen undergarments of fine twisted linen, '
    29: "²⁹ and the sash of fine twisted linen, and of blue, purple, and crimson yarns,\
      \ embroidered with needlework; as the Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    30: '³⁰ They made the rosette of the holy diadem of pure gold, and wrote on it
      an inscription, like the engraving of a signet, “Holy to the Lord.” '
    31: "³¹ They tied to it a blue cord, to fasten it on the turban above; as the\
      \ Lord had commanded Moses. \n"
    32: '³² In this way all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was
      finished; the Israelites had done everything just as the Lord had commanded
      Moses. '
    33: '³³ Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils,
      its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases; '
    34: '³⁴ the covering of tanned rams’ skins and the covering of fine leather, and
      the curtain for the screen; '
    35: '³⁵ the ark of the covenant with its poles and the mercy seat; '
    36: '³⁶ the table with all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; '
    37: '³⁷ the pure lampstand with its lamps set on it and all its utensils, and
      the oil for the light; '
    38: '³⁸ the golden altar, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the
      screen for the entrance of the tent; '
    39: '³⁹ the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils;
      the basin with its stand; '
    40: '⁴⁰ the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its bases, and the screen
      for the gate of the court, its cords, and its pegs; and all the utensils for
      the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; '
    41: '⁴¹ the finely worked vestments for ministering in the holy place, the sacred
      vestments for the priest Aaron, and the vestments of his sons to serve as priests. '
    42: '⁴² The Israelites had done all of the work just as the Lord had commanded
      Moses. '
    43: ⁴³ When Moses saw that they had done all the work just as the Lord had commanded,
      he blessed them.
  40:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    2: '² On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the
      tent of meeting. '
    3: '³ You shall put in it the ark of the covenant, and you shall screen the ark
      with the curtain. '
    4: '⁴ You shall bring in the table, and arrange its setting; and you shall bring
      in the lampstand, and set up its lamps. '
    5: '⁵ You shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the covenant,
      and set up the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle. '
    6: '⁶ You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle
      of the tent of meeting, '
    7: '⁷ and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water
      in it. '
    8: '⁸ You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen for the gate
      of the court. '
    9: '⁹ Then you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all
      that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it shall become
      holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils,
      and consecrate the altar, so that the altar shall be most holy. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall also anoint the basin with its stand, and consecrate it. '
    12: '¹² Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of
      meeting, and shall wash them with water, '
    13: '¹³ and put on Aaron the sacred vestments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate
      him, so that he may serve me as priest. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall bring his sons also and put tunics on them, '
    15: "¹⁵ and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me\
      \ as priests: and their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood\
      \ throughout all generations to come. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moses did everything just as the Lord had commanded him. '
    17: '¹⁷ In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month,
      the tabernacle was set up. '
    18: '¹⁸ Moses set up the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames,
      and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars; '
    19: '¹⁹ and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the
      tent over it; as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    20: '²⁰ He took the covenant and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the
      ark, and set the mercy seat above the ark; '
    21: '²¹ and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the curtain for
      screening, and screened the ark of the covenant; as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    22: '²² He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle,
      outside the curtain, '
    23: '²³ and set the bread in order on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded
      Moses. '
    24: '²⁴ He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the
      south side of the tabernacle, '
    25: '²⁵ and set up the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    26: '²⁶ He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain, '
    27: '²⁷ and offered fragrant incense on it; as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    28: '²⁸ He also put in place the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle. '
    29: '²⁹ He set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of
      the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering
      as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    30: '³⁰ He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water
      in it for washing, '
    31: '³¹ with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet. '
    32: '³² When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the
      altar, they washed; as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    33: "³³ He set up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the\
      \ screen at the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work. \n"
    34: '³⁴ Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord
      filled the tabernacle. '
    35: '³⁵ Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled
      upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. '
    36: '³⁶ Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would
      set out on each stage of their journey; '
    37: '³⁷ but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the
      day that it was taken up. '
    38: ³⁸ For the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in
      the cloud by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel at each stage
      of their journey.
