Nehemiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth
      year, while I was in Susa the capital, '
    2: '² one of my brothers, Hanani, came with certain men from Judah; and I asked
      them about the Jews that survived, those who had escaped the captivity, and
      about Jerusalem. '
    3: "³ They replied, “The survivors there in the province who escaped captivity\
      \ are in great trouble and shame; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and\
      \ its gates have been destroyed by fire.” \n"
    4: '⁴ When I heard these words I sat down and wept, and mourned for days, fasting
      and praying before the God of heaven. '
    5: '⁵ I said, “O Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant
      and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments; '
    6: '⁶ let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your
      servant that I now pray before you day and night for your servants, the people
      of Israel, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned
      against you. Both I and my family have sinned. '
    7: '⁷ We have offended you deeply, failing to keep the commandments, the statutes,
      and the ordinances that you commanded your servant Moses. '
    8: '⁸ Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, ‘If you are unfaithful,
      I will scatter you among the peoples; '
    9: '⁹ but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your
      outcasts are under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there and bring
      them to the place at which I have chosen to establish my name.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great
      power and your strong hand. '
    11: "¹¹ O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to\
      \ the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give success\
      \ to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man!”\nAt\
      \ the time, I was cupbearer to the king."
  2:
    1: '¹ In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine
      was served him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never
      been sad in his presence before. '
    2: '² So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This
      can only be sadness of the heart.” Then I was very much afraid. '
    3: '³ I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be
      sad, when the city, the place of my ancestors’ graves, lies waste, and its gates
      have been destroyed by fire?” '
    4: '⁴ Then the king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God
      of heaven. '
    5: '⁵ Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has
      found favor with you, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’
      graves, so that I may rebuild it.” '
    6: '⁶ The king said to me (the queen also was sitting beside him), “How long will
      you be gone, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and
      I set him a date. '
    7: '⁷ Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me
      to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may grant me passage
      until I arrive in Judah; '
    8: "⁸ and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, directing him to\
      \ give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for\
      \ the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.” And the king\
      \ granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave
      them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and cavalry
      with me. '
    10: "¹⁰ When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard this,\
      \ it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the\
      \ people of Israel. \n"
    11: '¹¹ So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. '
    12: '¹² Then I got up during the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one
      what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took
      was the animal I rode. '
    13: '¹³ I went out by night by the Valley Gate past the Dragon’s Spring and to
      the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down
      and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool; but there
      was no place for the animal I was riding to continue. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I went up by way of the valley by night and inspected the wall. Then
      I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. '
    16: "¹⁶ The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; I had\
      \ not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest\
      \ that were to do the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies
      in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem,
      so that we may no longer suffer disgrace.” '
    18: '¹⁸ I told them that the hand of my God had been gracious upon me, and also
      the words that the king had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us start building!”
      So they committed themselves to the common good. '
    19: '¹⁹ But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and
      Geshem the Arab heard of it, they mocked and ridiculed us, saying, “What is
      this that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” '
    20: ²⁰ Then I replied to them, “The God of heaven is the one who will give us
      success, and we his servants are going to start building; but you have no share
      or claim or historic right in Jerusalem.”
  3:
    1: '¹ Then the high priest Eliashib set to work with his fellow priests and rebuilt
      the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set up its doors; they consecrated it
      as far as the Tower of the Hundred and as far as the Tower of Hananel. '
    2: "² And the men of Jericho built next to him. And next to them Zaccur son of\
      \ Imri built. \n"
    3: '³ The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set up
      its doors, its bolts, and its bars. '
    4: '⁴ Next to them Meremoth son of Uriah son of Hakkoz made repairs. Next to them
      Meshullam son of Berechiah son of Meshezabel made repairs. Next to them Zadok
      son of Baana made repairs. '
    5: "⁵ Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles would not put their\
      \ shoulders to the work of their Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate;
      they laid its beams and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. '
    7: '⁷ Next to them repairs were made by Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite—the
      men of Gibeon and of Mizpah—who were under the jurisdiction of the governor
      of the province Beyond the River. '
    8: '⁸ Next to them Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs.
      Next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they restored
      Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. '
    9: '⁹ Next to them Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem,
      made repairs. '
    10: '¹⁰ Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house;
      and next to him Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs. '
    11: '¹¹ Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab repaired another
      section and the Tower of the Ovens. '
    12: "¹² Next to him Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem,\
      \ made repairs, he and his daughters. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate; they rebuilt\
      \ it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and repaired a thousand\
      \ cubits of the wall, as far as the Dung Gate. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired\
      \ the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And Shallum son of Col-hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired
      the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it and covered it and set up its doors, its bolts,
      and its bars; and he built the wall of the Pool of Shelah of the king’s garden,
      as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David. '
    16: '¹⁶ After him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth-zur,
      repaired from a point opposite the graves of David, as far as the artificial
      pool and the house of the warriors. '
    17: '¹⁷ After him the Levites made repairs: Rehum son of Bani; next to him Hashabiah,
      ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district. '
    18: '¹⁸ After him their kin made repairs: Binnui, son of Henadad, ruler of half
      the district of Keilah; '
    19: '¹⁹ next to him Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section
      opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle. '
    20: '²⁰ After him Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle
      to the door of the house of the high priest Eliashib. '
    21: '²¹ After him Meremoth son of Uriah son of Hakkoz repaired another section
      from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib. '
    22: '²² After him the priests, the men of the surrounding area, made repairs. '
    23: '²³ After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. After
      them Azariah son of Maaseiah son of Ananiah made repairs beside his own house. '
    24: '²⁴ After him Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house
      of Azariah to the Angle and to the corner. '
    25: '²⁵ Palal son of Uzai repaired opposite the Angle and the tower projecting
      from the upper house of the king at the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah
      son of Parosh '
    26: '²⁶ and the temple servants living on Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite
      the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower. '
    27: "²⁷ After him the Tekoites repaired another section opposite the great projecting\
      \ tower as far as the wall of Ophel. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one opposite his own
      house. '
    29: '²⁹ After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his own house. After
      him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs. '
    30: '³⁰ After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired
      another section. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite
      his living quarters. '
    31: '³¹ After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the
      house of the temple servants and of the merchants, opposite the Muster Gate,
      and to the upper room of the corner. '
    32: ³² And between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths
      and the merchants made repairs.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and
      greatly enraged, and he mocked the Jews. '
    2: '² He said in the presence of his associates and of the army of Samaria, “What
      are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice?
      Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of
      rubbish—and burned ones at that?” '
    3: '³ Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “That stone wall they are
      building—any fox going up on it would break it down!” '
    4: '⁴ Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their taunt back on their own
      heads, and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. '
    5: "⁵ Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from your\
      \ sight; for they have hurled insults in the face of the builders. \n"
    6: "⁶ So we rebuilt the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half its\
      \ height; for the people had a mind to work. \n"
    7: '⁷ But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites
      heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the
      gaps were beginning to be closed, they were very angry, '
    8: '⁸ and all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause
      confusion in it. '
    9: "⁹ So we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day\
      \ and night. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But Judah said, “The strength of the burden bearers is failing, and there
      is too much rubbish so that we are unable to work on the wall.” '
    11: '¹¹ And our enemies said, “They will not know or see anything before we come
      upon them and kill them and stop the work.” '
    12: '¹² When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times, “From
      all the places where they live they will come up against us.” '
    13: '¹³ So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I
      stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears,
      and their bows. '
    14: "¹⁴ After I looked these things over, I stood up and said to the nobles and\
      \ the officials and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember\
      \ the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your kin, your sons, your\
      \ daughters, your wives, and your homes.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When our enemies heard that their plot was known to us, and that God had
      frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. '
    16: '¹⁶ From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half
      held the spears, shields, bows, and body-armor; and the leaders posted themselves
      behind the whole house of Judah, '
    17: '¹⁷ who were building the wall. The burden bearers carried their loads in
      such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and with the other held
      a weapon. '
    18: '¹⁸ And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built.
      The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. '
    19: '¹⁹ And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The
      work is great and widely spread out, and we are separated far from one another
      on the wall. '
    20: "²⁰ Rally to us wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet. Our God will fight\
      \ for us.” \n"
    21: '²¹ So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from break
      of dawn until the stars came out. '
    22: '²² I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant
      pass the night inside Jerusalem, so that they may be a guard for us by night
      and may labor by day.” '
    23: ²³ So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who
      followed me ever took off our clothes; each kept his weapon in his right hand.
  5:
    1: '¹ Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their
      Jewish kin. '
    2: '² For there were those who said, “With our sons and our daughters, we are
      many; we must get grain, so that we may eat and stay alive.” '
    3: '³ There were also those who said, “We are having to pledge our fields, our
      vineyards, and our houses in order to get grain during the famine.” '
    4: '⁴ And there were those who said, “We are having to borrow money on our fields
      and vineyards to pay the king’s tax. '
    5: "⁵ Now our flesh is the same as that of our kindred; our children are the same\
      \ as their children; and yet we are forcing our sons and daughters to be slaves,\
      \ and some of our daughters have been ravished; we are powerless, and our fields\
      \ and vineyards now belong to others.” \n"
    6: '⁶ I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints. '
    7: '⁷ After thinking it over, I brought charges against the nobles and the officials;
      I said to them, “You are all taking interest from your own people.” And I called
      a great assembly to deal with them, '
    8: '⁸ and said to them, “As far as we were able, we have bought back our Jewish
      kindred who had been sold to other nations; but now you are selling your own
      kin, who must then be bought back by us!” They were silent, and could not find
      a word to say. '
    9: '⁹ So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk
      in the fear of our God, to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies? '
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and
      grain. Let us stop this taking of interest. '
    11: '¹¹ Restore to them, this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive
      orchards, and their houses, and the interest on money, grain, wine, and oil
      that you have been exacting from them.” '
    12: '¹² Then they said, “We will restore everything and demand nothing more from
      them. We will do as you say.” And I called the priests, and made them take an
      oath to do as they had promised. '
    13: "¹³ I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out\
      \ everyone from house and from property who does not perform this promise. Thus\
      \ may they be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen,” and\
      \ praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the
      land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes,
      twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor. '
    15: '¹⁵ The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people,
      and took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Even their
      servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear
      of God. '
    16: '¹⁶ Indeed, I devoted myself to the work on this wall, and acquired no land;
      and all my servants were gathered there for the work. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover there were at my table one hundred fifty people, Jews and officials,
      besides those who came to us from the nations around us. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep;
      also fowls were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of wine in abundance;
      yet with all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because
      of the heavy burden of labor on the people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arab
      and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was
      no gap left in it (though up to that time I had not set up the doors in the
      gates), '
    2: '² Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together
      in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to do me harm. '
    3: '³ So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot
      come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?” '
    4: '⁴ They sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same
      manner. '
    5: '⁵ In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with
      an open letter in his hand. '
    6: '⁶ In it was written, “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem also says
      it—that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall;
      and according to this report you wish to become their king. '
    7: '⁷ You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘There
      is a king in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these
      words. So come, therefore, and let us confer together.” '
    8: '⁸ Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done; you
      are inventing them out of your own mind” '
    9: "⁹ —for they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from\
      \ the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ One day when I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel,
      who was confined to his house, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of
      God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are
      coming to kill you; indeed, tonight they are coming to kill you.” '
    11: '¹¹ But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into
      the temple to save his life? I will not go in!” '
    12: '¹² Then I perceived and saw that God had not sent him at all, but he had
      pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. '
    13: '¹³ He was hired for this purpose, to intimidate me and make me sin by acting
      in this way, and so they could give me a bad name, in order to taunt me. '
    14: "¹⁴ Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that\
      \ they did, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who\
      \ wanted to make me afraid. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in
      fifty-two days. '
    16: '¹⁶ And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid
      and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had
      been accomplished with the help of our God. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah,
      and Tobiah’s letters came to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law
      of Shecaniah son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of
      Meshullam son of Berechiah. '
    19: ¹⁹ Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words
      to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
  7:
    1: '¹ Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers,
      the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, '
    2: '² I gave my brother Hanani charge over Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the
      commander of the citadel—for he was a faithful man and feared God more than
      many. '
    3: '³ And I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the
      sun is hot; while the gatekeepers are still standing guard, let them shut and
      bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, some
      at their watch posts, and others before their own houses.” '
    4: "⁴ The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few and no houses\
      \ had been built. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then my God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles and the officials\
      \ and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy\
      \ of those who were the first to come back, and I found the following written\
      \ in it: \n"
    6: '⁶ These are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of
      those exiles whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried into exile; they
      returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town. '
    7: "⁷ They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,\
      \ Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.\nThe number of the Israelite\
      \ people: "
    8: '⁸ the descendants of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two. '
    9: '⁹ Of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two. '
    10: '¹⁰ Of Arah, six hundred fifty-two. '
    11: '¹¹ Of Pahath-moab, namely the descendants of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand
      eight hundred eighteen. '
    12: '¹² Of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four. '
    13: '¹³ Of Zattu, eight hundred forty-five. '
    14: '¹⁴ Of Zaccai, seven hundred sixty. '

    61: '⁶¹ The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub,
      Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their ancestral houses or their descent,
      whether they belonged to Israel: '

    63: '⁶³ Also, of the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, of Hakkoz, of Barzillai
      (who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called
      by their name). '
    64: '⁶⁴ These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies,
      but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean; '
    65: "⁶⁵ the governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy\

    66: '⁶⁶ The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty, '

    71: '⁷¹ And some of the heads of ancestral houses gave into the building fund

    72: "⁷² And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold,\
      \ two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priestly robes. \n"
    73: "⁷³ So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the\
      \ people, the temple servants, and all Israel settled in their towns.\nWhen\
      \ the seventh month came—the people of Israel being settled in their towns—"
  8:
    1: '¹ all the people gathered together into the square before the Water Gate.
      They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord
      had given to Israel. '
    2: '² Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the assembly, both men
      and women and all who could hear with understanding. This was on the first day
      of the seventh month. '
    3: '³ He read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning
      until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand;
      and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. '
    4: '⁴ The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden platform that had been made for the purpose;
      and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah
      on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah,
      and Meshullam on his left hand. '
    5: '⁵ And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing
      above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. '
    6: '⁶ Then Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered,
      “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands. Then they bowed their heads and worshiped
      the Lord with their faces to the ground. '
    7: '⁷ Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah,
      Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to
      understand the law, while the people remained in their places. '
    8: "⁸ So they read from the book, from the law of God, with interpretation. They\
      \ gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading. \n"
    9: '⁹ And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and
      the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy
      to the Lord your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept when they
      heard the words of the law. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and
      send portions of them to those for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is
      holy to our Lord; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” '
    11: '¹¹ So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day
      is holy; do not be grieved.” '
    12: "¹² And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions\
      \ and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were\
      \ declared to them. \n"
    13: '¹³ On the second day the heads of ancestral houses of all the people, with
      the priests and the Levites, came together to the scribe Ezra in order to study
      the words of the law. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they found it written in the law, which the Lord had commanded by
      Moses, that the people of Israel should live in booths during the festival of
      the seventh month, '
    15: '¹⁵ and that they should publish and proclaim in all their towns and in Jerusalem
      as follows, “Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle,
      palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So the people went out and brought them, and made booths for themselves,
      each on the roofs of their houses, and in their courts and in the courts of
      the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the
      Gate of Ephraim. '
    17: '¹⁷ And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made
      booths and lived in them; for from the days of Jeshua son of Nun to that day
      the people of Israel had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing. '
    18: ¹⁸ And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the book
      of the law of God. They kept the festival seven days; and on the eighth day
      there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the people of Israel were assembled
      with fasting and in sackcloth, and with earth on their heads. '
    2: '² Then those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners,
      and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors. '
    3: '³ They stood up in their place and read from the book of the law of the Lord
      their God for a fourth part of the day, and for another fourth they made confession
      and worshiped the Lord their God. '
    4: '⁴ Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani
      stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord
      their God. '
    5: "⁵ Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah,\
      \ Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the Lord your God from\
      \ everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted\
      \ above all blessing and praise.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And Ezra said: “You are the Lord, you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven
      of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and
      all that is in them. To all of them you give life, and the host of heaven worships
      you. '
    7: '⁷ You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the
      Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham; '
    8: "⁸ and you found his heart faithful before you, and made with him a covenant\
      \ to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite,\
      \ the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite; and you have fulfilled your\
      \ promise, for you are righteous. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And you saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry
      at the Red Sea. '
    10: '¹⁰ You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and
      all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted insolently against
      our ancestors. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. '
    11: '¹¹ And you divided the sea before them, so that they passed through the sea
      on dry land, but you threw their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into
      mighty waters. '
    12: '¹² Moreover, you led them by day with a pillar of cloud, and by night with
      a pillar of fire, to give them light on the way in which they should go. '
    13: '¹³ You came down also upon Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven,
      and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, '
    14: '¹⁴ and you made known your holy sabbath to them and gave them commandments
      and statutes and a law through your servant Moses. '
    15: "¹⁵ For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven, and for their thirst\
      \ you brought water for them out of the rock, and you told them to go in to\
      \ possess the land that you swore to give them. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But they and our ancestors acted presumptuously and stiffened their necks
      and did not obey your commandments; '
    17: '¹⁷ they refused to obey, and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed
      among them; but they stiffened their necks and determined to return to their
      slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful,
      slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and you did not forsake them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Even when they had cast an image of a calf for themselves and said, ‘This
      is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed great blasphemies, '
    19: '¹⁹ you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness; the
      pillar of cloud that led them in the way did not leave them by day, nor the
      pillar of fire by night that gave them light on the way by which they should
      go. '
    20: '²⁰ You gave your good spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold your
      manna from their mouths, and gave them water for their thirst. '
    21: '²¹ Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing;
      their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell. '
    22: '²² And you gave them kingdoms and peoples, and allotted to them every corner,
      so they took possession of the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of
      King Og of Bashan. '
    23: '²³ You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven, and brought
      them into the land that you had told their ancestors to enter and possess. '
    24: '²⁴ So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before
      them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands,
      with their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them as they pleased. '
    25: "²⁵ And they captured fortress cities and a rich land, and took possession\
      \ of houses filled with all sorts of goods, hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive\
      \ orchards, and fruit trees in abundance; so they ate, and were filled and became\
      \ fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast
      your law behind their backs and killed your prophets, who had warned them in
      order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore you gave them into the hands of their enemies, who made them
      suffer. Then in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard
      them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors
      who saved them from the hands of their enemies. '
    28: '²⁸ But after they had rest, they again did evil before you, and you abandoned
      them to the hands of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet
      when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you
      rescued them according to your mercies. '
    29: '²⁹ And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted
      presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances,
      by the observance of which a person shall live. They turned a stubborn shoulder
      and stiffened their neck and would not obey. '
    30: '³⁰ Many years you were patient with them, and warned them by your spirit
      through your prophets; yet they would not listen. Therefore you handed them
      over to the peoples of the lands. '
    31: "³¹ Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or\
      \ forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. \n"
    32: '³² “Now therefore, our God—the great and mighty and awesome God, keeping
      covenant and steadfast love—do not treat lightly all the hardship that has come
      upon us, upon our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors,
      and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until today. '
    33: '³³ You have been just in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully
      and we have acted wickedly; '
    34: '³⁴ our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept
      your law or heeded the commandments and the warnings that you gave them. '
    35: '³⁵ Even in their own kingdom, and in the great goodness you bestowed on them,
      and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve
      you and did not turn from their wicked works. '
    36: '³⁶ Here we are, slaves to this day—slaves in the land that you gave to our
      ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts. '
    37: "³⁷ Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of\
      \ our sins; they have power also over our bodies and over our livestock at their\
      \ pleasure, and we are in great distress.” \n"
    38: ³⁸ Because of all this we make a firm agreement in writing, and on that sealed
      document are inscribed the names of our officials, our Levites, and our priests.

      the house of our God. '
    34: '³⁴ We have also cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people,

      at appointed times, year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God,
      as it is written in the law. '
    35: '³⁵ We obligate ourselves to bring the first fruits of our soil and the first
      fruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the Lord; '

    15: '¹⁵ And of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah
      son of Bunni; '
    16: '¹⁶ and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the leaders of the Levites, who were over
      the outside work of the house of God; '
    17: '¹⁷ and Mattaniah son of Mica son of Zabdi son of Asaph, who was the leader
      to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his associates;
      and Abda son of Shammua son of Galal son of Jeduthun. '
    18: "¹⁸ All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at
      the gates, were one hundred seventy-two. '
    20: '²⁰ And the rest of Israel, and of the priests and the Levites, were in all
      the towns of Judah, all of them in their inheritance. '
    21: "²¹ But the temple servants lived on Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over\
      \ the temple servants. \n"
    22: '²² The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani son of Hashabiah
      son of Mattaniah son of Mica, of the descendants of Asaph, the singers, in charge
      of the work of the house of God. '
    23: '²³ For there was a command from the king concerning them, and a settled provision
      for the singers, as was required every day. '
    24: "²⁴ And Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah,\
      \ was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people. \n"
    25: '²⁵ And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah
      lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in
      Jekabzeel and its villages, '
    26: '²⁶ and in Jeshua and in Moladah and Beth-pelet, '
    27: '²⁷ in Hazar-shual, in Beer-sheba and its villages, '
    28: '²⁸ in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages, '
    29: '²⁹ in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, '
    30: '³⁰ Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah
      and its villages. So they camped from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom. '
    31: '³¹ The people of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash, Aija,
      Bethel and its villages, '
    32: '³² Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, '
    33: '³³ Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, '
    34: '³⁴ Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, '
    35: '³⁵ Lod, and Ono, the valley of artisans. '
    36: ³⁶ And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah were joined to Benjamin.
  12:
    1: '¹ These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of
      Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, '
    2: '² Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, '
    3: '³ Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, '
    4: '⁴ Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, '
    5: '⁵ Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, '
    6: '⁶ Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, '
    7: "⁷ Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and\
      \ of their associates in the days of Jeshua. \n"
    8: '⁸ And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah,
      who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. '
    9: '⁹ And Bakbukiah and Unno their associates stood opposite them in the service. '
    10: '¹⁰ Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib
      the father of Joiada, '
    11: "¹¹ Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua. \n"
    12: '¹² In the days of Joiakim the priests, heads of ancestral houses, were: of
      Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; '
    13: '¹³ of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; '
    14: '¹⁴ of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; '
    15: '¹⁵ of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; '
    16: '¹⁶ of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; '
    17: '¹⁷ of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; '
    18: '¹⁸ of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; '
    19: '¹⁹ of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; '
    20: '²⁰ of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; '
    21: "²¹ of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. \n"
    22: '²² As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua,
      there were recorded the heads of ancestral houses; also the priests until the
      reign of Darius the Persian. '
    23: '²³ The Levites, heads of ancestral houses, were recorded in the Book of the
      Annals until the days of Johanan son of Eliashib. '
    24: '²⁴ And the leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of
      Kadmiel, with their associates over against them, to praise and to give thanks,
      according to the commandment of David the man of God, section opposite to section. '
    25: '²⁵ Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers
      standing guard at the storehouses of the gates. '
    26: "²⁶ These were in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and in\
      \ the days of the governor Nehemiah and of the priest Ezra, the scribe. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites
      in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication
      with rejoicing, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and
      lyres. '
    28: '²⁸ The companies of the singers gathered together from the circuit around
      Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites; '
    29: '²⁹ also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth; for the
      singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem. '
    30: "³⁰ And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified\
      \ the people and the gates and the wall. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall, and appointed two
      great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right
      on the wall to the Dung Gate; '
    32: '³² and after them went Hoshaiah and half the officials of Judah, '
    33: '³³ and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, '
    34: '³⁴ Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, '
    35: '³⁵ and some of the young priests with trumpets: Zechariah son of Jonathan
      son of Shemaiah son of Mattaniah son of Micaiah son of Zaccur son of Asaph; '
    36: '³⁶ and his kindred, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah,
      and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and the scribe
      Ezra went in front of them. '
    37: "³⁷ At the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went straight up by the stairs\
      \ of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David,\
      \ to the Water Gate on the east. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The other company of those who gave thanks went to the left, and I followed
      them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the
      Broad Wall, '
    39: '³⁹ and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate
      and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and
      they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard. '
    40: '⁴⁰ So both companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God,
      and I and half of the officials with me; '
    41: '⁴¹ and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
      and Hananiah, with trumpets; '
    42: '⁴² and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and
      Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader. '
    43: "⁴³ They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made\
      \ them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. The joy\
      \ of Jerusalem was heard far away. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions,
      the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required
      by the law for the priests and for the Levites from the fields belonging to
      the towns; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered. '
    45: '⁴⁵ They performed the service of their God and the service of purification,
      as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and
      his son Solomon. '
    46: '⁴⁶ For in the days of David and Asaph long ago there was a leader of the
      singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. '
    47: ⁴⁷ In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the
      daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They set apart that which
      was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants
      of Aaron.
  13:
    1: '¹ On that day they read from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people;
      and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the
      assembly of God, '
    2: '² because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired
      Balaam against them to curse them—yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. '
    3: "³ When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign\
      \ descent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now before this, the priest Eliashib, who was appointed over the chambers
      of the house of our God, and who was related to Tobiah, '
    5: '⁵ prepared for Tobiah a large room where they had previously put the grain
      offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and
      oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers,
      and the contributions for the priests. '
    6: '⁶ While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second
      year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon I went to the king. After some time I asked
      leave of the king '
    7: '⁷ and returned to Jerusalem. I then discovered the wrong that Eliashib had
      done on behalf of Tobiah, preparing a room for him in the courts of the house
      of God. '
    8: '⁸ And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah
      out of the room. '
    9: "⁹ Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back the\
      \ vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to
      them; so that the Levites and the singers, who had conducted the service, had
      gone back to their fields. '
    11: '¹¹ So I remonstrated with the officials and said, “Why is the house of God
      forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations. '
    12: '¹² Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the
      storehouses. '
    13: '¹³ And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah,
      the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan son
      of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful; and their duty
      was to distribute to their associates. '
    14: "¹⁴ Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds\
      \ that I have done for the house of my God and for his service. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In those days I saw in Judah people treading wine presses on the sabbath,
      and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys; and also wine, grapes,
      figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath
      day; and I warned them at that time against selling food. '
    16: '¹⁶ Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of
      merchandise and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is
      this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day? '
    18: "¹⁸ Did not your ancestors act in this way, and did not our God bring all\
      \ this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by\
      \ profaning the sabbath.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath,
      I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not
      be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates,
      to prevent any burden from being brought in on the sabbath day. '
    20: '²⁰ Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night
      outside Jerusalem once or twice. '
    21: '²¹ But I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front
      of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on
      they did not come on the sabbath. '
    22: "²² And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come\
      \ and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my\
      \ favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast\
      \ love. \n"
    23: '²³ In those days also I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon,
      and Moab; '
    24: '²⁴ and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could
      not speak the language of Judah, but spoke the language of various peoples. '
    25: '²⁵ And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled
      out their hair; and I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, “You
      shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your
      sons or for yourselves. '
    26: '²⁶ Did not King Solomon of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the
      many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and
      God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, foreign women made even him
      to sin. '
    27: "²⁷ Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously\
      \ against our God by marrying foreign women?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ And one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, was
      the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; I chased him away from me. '
    29: "²⁹ Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, the\
      \ covenant of the priests and the Levites. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties
      of the priests and Levites, each in his work; '
    31: ³¹ and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first
      fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
