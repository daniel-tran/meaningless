3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. \n"
    2: '² Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good
      health, just as it is well with your soul. '
    3: '³ I was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness
      to the truth, namely how you walk in the truth. '
    4: "⁴ I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in\
      \ the truth. \n"
    5: '⁵ Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends, even though
      they are strangers to you; '
    6: '⁶ they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to
      send them on in a manner worthy of God; '
    7: '⁷ for they began their journey for the sake of Christ, accepting no support
      from non-believers. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may become co-workers\
      \ with the truth. \n"
    9: '⁹ I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put
      himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. '
    10: "¹⁰ So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false\
      \ charges against us. And not content with those charges, he refuses to welcome\
      \ the friends, and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from\
      \ the church. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good. Whoever
      does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God. '
    12: "¹² Everyone has testified favorably about Demetrius, and so has the truth\
      \ itself. We also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ I have much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and
      ink; '
    14: "¹⁴ instead I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face.\
      \ \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Peace to you. The friends send you their greetings. Greet the friends there,
      each by name.
