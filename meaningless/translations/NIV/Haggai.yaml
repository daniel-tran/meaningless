Haggai:
  1:
    1: "¹ In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month,\
      \ the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of\
      \ Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² This is what the Lord Almighty says: “These people say, ‘The time has not\
      \ yet come to rebuild the Lord’s house.’” \n"
    3: '³ Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: '
    4: "⁴ “Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while\
      \ this house remains a ruin?” \n"
    5: '⁵ Now this is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. '
    6: "⁶ You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough.\
      \ You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm.\
      \ You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.” \n"
    7: '⁷ This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. '
    8: '⁸ Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that
      I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the Lord. '
    9: '⁹ “You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought
      home, I blew away. Why?” declares the Lord Almighty. “Because of my house, which
      remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the
      earth its crops. '
    11: "¹¹ I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain,\
      \ the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people\
      \ and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest,\
      \ and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God\
      \ and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord their God had sent\
      \ him. And the people feared the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, gave this message of the Lord to the
      people: “I am with you,” declares the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor
      of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the
      spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the
      house of the Lord Almighty, their God, '
    15: "¹⁵ on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.\nIn the second year of King\
      \ Darius,"
  2:
    1: '¹ on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came
      through the prophet Haggai: '
    2: '² “Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son
      of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, '
    3: '³ ‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it
      look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? '
    4: '⁴ But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord. ‘Be strong, Joshua son
      of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares
      the Lord, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the Lord Almighty. '
    5: "⁵ ‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit\
      \ remains among you. Do not fear.’ \n"
    6: '⁶ “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more
      shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. '
    7: '⁷ I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come,
      and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord Almighty. '
    8: '⁸ ‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the Lord Almighty. '
    9: "⁹ ‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former\
      \ house,’ says the Lord Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares\
      \ the Lord Almighty.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius,
      the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai: '
    11: '¹¹ “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says: '
    12: "¹² If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and\
      \ that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food,\
      \ does it become consecrated?’”\nThe priests answered, “No.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches\
      \ one of these things, does it become defiled?”\n“Yes,” the priests replied,\
      \ “it becomes defiled.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Haggai said, “‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’\
      \ declares the Lord. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things
      were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord’s temple. '
    16: '¹⁶ When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When
      anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. '
    17: '¹⁷ I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet
      you did not return to me,’ declares the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give
      careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid.
      Give careful thought: '
    19: "¹⁹ Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig\
      \ tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.\n“‘From this\
      \ day on I will bless you.’” \n"
    20: '²⁰ The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth
      day of the month: '
    21: '²¹ “Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens
      and the earth. '
    22: "²² I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms.\
      \ I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will\
      \ fall, each by the sword of his brother. \n"
    23: ²³ “‘On that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘I will take you, my servant
      Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will make you like my
      signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
