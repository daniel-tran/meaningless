    33: "³³ The Levites, however, were not counted along with the other Israelites,\

    4: "⁴ Nadab and Abihu, however, died before the Lord when they made an offering\
      \ with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons,\
      \ so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father\
      \ Aaron. \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to Moses, '
    6: '⁶ “Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist
      him. '
    7: '⁷ They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent

    9: '⁹ Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are
      to be given wholly to him. '
    10: "¹⁰ Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches\
      \ the sanctuary is to be put to death.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ The Lord also said to Moses, '
    12: '¹² “I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first
      male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine, '
    13: "¹³ for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in\
      \ Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or\
      \ animal. They are to be mine. I am the Lord.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai, '
    15: '¹⁵ “Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month
      old or more.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the Lord. \n"

    21: '²¹ To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were
      the Gershonite clans. '
    22: '²² The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500. '
    23: '²³ The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle. '
    24: '²⁴ The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. '
    25: '²⁵ At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of
      the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent
      of meeting, '
    26: "²⁶ the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard\

      \ to their use. \n"
    27: '²⁷ To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and
      Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans. '
    28: '²⁸ The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites
      were responsible for the care of the sanctuary. '
    29: '²⁹ The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle. '
    30: '³⁰ The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of
      Uzziel. '
    31: '³¹ They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand,
      the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain,
      and everything related to their use. '
    32: "³² The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest.\
      \ He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were
      the Merarite clans. '
    34: '³⁴ The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200. '
    35: '³⁵ The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail;
      they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. '
    36: '³⁶ The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle,
      its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their
      use, '
    37: "³⁷ as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent\
      \ pegs and ropes. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle,\
      \ toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible\
      \ for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who\
      \ approached the sanctuary was to be put to death. \n"
    39: "³⁹ The total number of Levites counted at the Lord’s command by Moses and\
      \ Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more,\
      \ was 22,000. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ The Lord said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are
      a month old or more and make a list of their names. '
    41: "⁴¹ Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites,\
      \ and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock\
      \ of the Israelites. I am the Lord.” \n"
    42: '⁴² So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the Lord commanded
      him. '
    43: "⁴³ The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name,\
      \ was 22,273. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ The Lord also said to Moses, '
    45: '⁴⁵ “Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock
      of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am
      the Lord. '
    46: '⁴⁶ To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites, '
    47: '⁴⁷ collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel,
      which weighs twenty gerahs. '
    48: "⁴⁸ Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron\
      \ and his sons.” \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number
      redeemed by the Levites. '
    50: '⁵⁰ From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365
      shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. '
    51: ⁵¹ Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded
      by the word of the Lord.
  4:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: '
    2: '² “Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and
      families. '
    3: "³ Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in\
      \ the work at the tent of meeting. \n"
    4: '⁴ “This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of
      the most holy things. '
    5: '⁵ When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down
      the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law. '
    6: "⁶ Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth\
      \ of solid blue over that and put the poles in place. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put
      on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread
      that is continually there is to remain on it. '
    8: "⁸ They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable\
      \ leather and put the poles in place. \n"
    9: '⁹ “They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light,
      together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the
      olive oil used to supply it. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the\
      \ durable leather and put it on a carrying frame. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with\

    13: '¹³ “They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple
      cloth over it. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at\
      \ the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls.\
      \ Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles\
      \ in place. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings\
      \ and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are\
      \ the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy\
      \ things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are\
      \ in the tent of meeting. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the\
      \ light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing\
      \ oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it,\
      \ including its holy furnishings and articles.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    18: '¹⁸ “See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not destroyed from among the
      Levites. '
    19: '¹⁹ So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things,
      do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign
      to each man his work and what he is to carry. '
    20: "²⁰ But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for\
      \ a moment, or they will die.” \n"
    21: '²¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    22: '²² “Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans. '
    23: "²³ Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve\

    26: '²⁶ the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the

    27: '²⁷ All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done

    37: "³⁷ This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served at the\

    38: '³⁸ The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families. '
    39: '³⁹ All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the
      work at the tent of meeting, '
    40: '⁴⁰ counted by their clans and families, were 2,630. '
    41: "⁴¹ This was the total of those in the Gershonite clans who served at the\

    46: '⁴⁶ So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their

    47: '⁴⁷ All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work
      of serving and carrying the tent of meeting '

    49: "⁴⁹ At the Lord’s command through Moses, each was assigned his work and told\
      \ what to carry.\nThus they were counted, as the Lord commanded Moses."
  5:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling
      skin disease or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because
      of a dead body. '
    3: '³ Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will
      not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.” '
    4: "⁴ The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as\
      \ the Lord had instructed Moses. \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to Moses, '
    6: '⁶ “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way
      and so is unfaithful to the Lord is guilty '
    7: '⁷ and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution
      for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all
      to the person they have wronged. '
    8: '⁸ But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made
      for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the Lord and must be given to the
      priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer. '
    9: '⁹ All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong
      to him. '
    10: "¹⁰ Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest\
      \ will belong to the priest.’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    12: '¹² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man’s wife goes astray
      and is unfaithful to him '
    13: '¹³ so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden
      from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against
      her and she has not been caught in the act), '
    14: '¹⁴ and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his
      wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she
      is not impure— '
    15: "¹⁵ then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering\
      \ of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive\
      \ oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy,\
      \ a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from
      the tabernacle floor into the water. '
    18: '¹⁸ After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen
      her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for
      jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no
      other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and
      become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings
      a curse not harm you. '
    20: '²⁰ But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have
      made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”— '
    21: '²¹ here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the Lord cause
      you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and
      your abdomen swell. '
    22: "²² May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen\
      \ swells or your womb miscarries.”\n“‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be\
      \ it.” \n"
    23: '²³ “‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off
      into the bitter water. '
    24: '²⁴ He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and
      this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy,
      wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial
      offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink
      the water. '
    27: '²⁷ If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this
      will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse
      and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her
      womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. '
    28: "²⁸ If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she\
      \ will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes
      herself impure while married to her husband, '
    30: '³⁰ or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife.
      The priest is to have her stand before the Lord and is to apply this entire
      law to her. '
    31: ³¹ The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear
      the consequences of her sin.’”
  6:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man or woman wants to make
      a special vow, a vow of dedication to the Lord as a Nazirite, '
    3: '³ they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink
      vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice
      or eat grapes or raisins. '
    4: "⁴ As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything\
      \ that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins. \n"
    5: "⁵ “‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on\
      \ their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the\
      \ Lord is over; they must let their hair grow long. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘Throughout the period of their dedication to the Lord, the Nazirite must
      not go near a dead body. '
    7: '⁷ Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must
      not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol
      of their dedication to God is on their head. '
    8: "⁸ Throughout the period of their dedication, they are consecrated to the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite’s presence, thus defiling the
      hair that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh
      day—the day of their cleansing. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons
      to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    11: '¹¹ The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt
      offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in
      the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head
      again. '
    12: "¹² They must rededicate themselves to the Lord for the same period of dedication\
      \ and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days\
      \ do not count, because they became defiled during their period of dedication.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication
      is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    14: '¹⁴ There they are to present their offerings to the Lord: a year-old male
      lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect
      for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering, '
    15: "¹⁵ together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket\
      \ of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive\
      \ oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘The priest is to present all these before the Lord and make the sin
      offering and the burnt offering. '
    17: "¹⁷ He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the\
      \ ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord, together with its grain offering\
      \ and drink offering. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave\
      \ off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and\
      \ put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication,
      the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one
      thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast. '
    20: "²⁰ The priest shall then wave these before the Lord as a wave offering; they\
      \ are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved\
      \ and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ “‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the Lord in accordance\
      \ with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They\
      \ must fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.’”\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² The Lord said to Moses, '
    23: "²³ “Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is how you are to bless the Israelites.\
      \ Say to them: \n"
    24: "²⁴ “‘“The Lord bless you\n    and keep you;\n"
    25: "²⁵ the Lord make his face shine on you\n    and be gracious to you;\n"
    26: "²⁶ the Lord turn his face toward you\n    and give you peace.”’ \n"
    27: ²⁷ “So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
  7:
    1: '¹ When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated
      it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all
      its utensils. '
    2: '² Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders
      in charge of those who were counted, made offerings. '
    3: "³ They brought as their gifts before the Lord six covered carts and twelve\
      \ oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented\
      \ before the tabernacle. \n"
    4: '⁴ The Lord said to Moses, '
    5: "⁵ “Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the tent of\
      \ meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man’s work requires.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites. '
    7: '⁷ He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required, '
    8: '⁸ and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required.
      They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. '
    9: "⁹ But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry\

    10: '¹⁰ When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its

      \ Lord had shown Moses. \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to Moses: '
    6: '⁶ “Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially
      clean. '
    7: '⁷ To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have
      them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify
      themselves. '
    8: '⁸ Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour
      mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering. '
    9: '⁹ Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole
      Israelite community. '
    10: '¹⁰ You are to bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Israelites are to
      lay their hands on them. '
    11: "¹¹ Aaron is to present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from\
      \ the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using
      one for a sin offering to the Lord and the other for a burnt offering, to make
      atonement for the Levites. '
    13: '¹³ Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present
      them as a wave offering to the Lord. '
    14: "¹⁴ In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites,\
      \ and the Levites will be mine. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering,
      they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting. '
    16: '¹⁶ They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken
      them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every
      Israelite woman. '
    17: '¹⁷ Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When
      I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel. '
    19: "¹⁹ From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron\
      \ and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites\
      \ and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites\
      \ when they go near the sanctuary.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just
      as the Lord commanded Moses. '
    21: '²¹ The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented
      them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to purify
      them. '
    22: "²² After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under\
      \ the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the\
      \ Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    23: '²³ The Lord said to Moses, '
    24: '²⁴ “This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall
      come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting, '
    25: '²⁵ but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and
      work no longer. '
    26: ²⁶ They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of
      meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are
      to assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”
  9:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the
      second year after they came out of Egypt. He said, '
    2: '² “Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time. '
    3: "³ Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of\
      \ this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover, '
    5: "⁵ and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day\
      \ of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded\
      \ Moses. \n"
    6: '⁶ But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they
      were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and
      Aaron that same day '
    7: "⁷ and said to Moses, “We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why\
      \ should we be kept from presenting the Lord’s offering with the other Israelites\
      \ at the appointed time?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Moses answered them, “Wait until I find out what the Lord commands concerning\
      \ you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you or your descendants are unclean
      because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate
      the Lord’s Passover, '
    11: '¹¹ but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight.
      They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. '
    12: '¹² They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones.
      When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations. '
    13: "¹³ But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to\
      \ celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting\
      \ the Lord’s offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences\
      \ of their sin. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “‘A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the Lord’s Passover\
      \ in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations\
      \ for both the foreigner and the native-born.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the
      cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked
      like fire. '
    16: '¹⁶ That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it
      looked like fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out;
      wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped. '
    18: '¹⁸ At the Lord’s command the Israelites set out, and at his command they
      encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in
      camp. '
    19: '¹⁹ When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites
      obeyed the Lord’s order and did not set out. '
    20: '²⁰ Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the Lord’s
      command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out. '
    21: '²¹ Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it
      lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the
      cloud lifted, they set out. '
    22: '²² Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or
      a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted,
      they would set out. '
    23: ²³ At the Lord’s command they encamped, and at the Lord’s command they set
      out. They obeyed the Lord’s order, in accordance with his command through Moses.
  10:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses: '
    2: '² “Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community
      together and for having the camps set out. '
    3: '³ When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at
      the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    4: '⁴ If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are
      to assemble before you. '
    5: '⁵ When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set
      out. '
    6: '⁶ At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out.
      The blast will be the signal for setting out. '
    7: "⁷ To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting\
      \ out. \n"
    8: '⁸ “The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be
      a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. '
    9: '⁹ When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing
      you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the Lord
      your God and rescued from your enemies. '
    10: "¹⁰ Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon\
      \ feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship\
      \ offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the Lord\
      \ your God.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud
      lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law. '
    12: '¹² Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from
      place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. '
    13: "¹³ They set out, this first time, at the Lord’s command through Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon
      son of Amminadab was in command. '
    15: '¹⁵ Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, '
    16: '¹⁶ and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites,\
      \ who carried it, set out. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur
      son of Shedeur was in command. '
    19: '¹⁹ Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, '
    20: '²⁰ and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. '
    21: "²¹ Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle\
      \ was to be set up before they arrived. \n"
    22: '²² The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard.
      Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. '
    23: '²³ Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, '
    24: "²⁴ and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp
      of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. '
    26: '²⁶ Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, '
    27: '²⁷ and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. '
    28: "²⁸ This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law,\
      \ “We are setting out for the place about which the Lord said, ‘I will give\
      \ it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the Lord has promised\
      \ good things to Israel.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my\
      \ own people.” \n"
    31: '³¹ But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp
      in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. '
    32: "³² If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the Lord\
      \ gives us.” \n"
    33: '³³ So they set out from the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days.
      The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during those three days
      to find them a place to rest. '
    34: "³⁴ The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the\
      \ camp. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Whenever the ark set out, Moses said,\n“Rise up, Lord!\n    May your enemies\
      \ be scattered;\n    may your foes flee before you.” \n"
    36: "³⁶ Whenever it came to rest, he said,\n“Return, Lord,\n    to the countless\
      \ thousands of Israel.”"
  11:
    1: '¹ Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the Lord,
      and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the Lord burned
      among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. '
    2: '² When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the Lord and the fire died
      down. '
    3: "³ So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the Lord had burned\
      \ among them. \n"
    4: '⁴ The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites
      started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat! '
    5: '⁵ We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons,
      leeks, onions and garlic. '
    6: "⁶ But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin. '
    8: '⁸ The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or
      crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And
      it tasted like something made with olive oil. '
    9: "⁹ When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their
      tents. The Lord became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled. '
    11: '¹¹ He asked the Lord, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant?
      What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people
      on me? '
    12: '¹² Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell
      me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised
      on oath to their ancestors? '
    13: '¹³ Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give
      us meat to eat!’ '
    14: '¹⁴ I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for
      me. '
    15: "¹⁵ If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if\
      \ I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known
      to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent
      of meeting, that they may stand there with you. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the\
      \ power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the\
      \ burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow,
      when you will eat meat. The Lord heard you when you wailed, “If only we had
      meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the Lord will give you meat,
      and you will eat it. '
    19: '¹⁹ You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty
      days, '
    20: "²⁰ but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe\
      \ it—because you have rejected the Lord, who is among you, and have wailed before\
      \ him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’” \n"
    21: '²¹ But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and
      you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’ '
    22: "²² Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them?\
      \ Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?” \n"
    23: "²³ The Lord answered Moses, “Is the Lord’s arm too short? Now you will see\
      \ whether or not what I say will come true for you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ So Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said. He brought
      together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent. '
    25: "²⁵ Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some\
      \ of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders.\
      \ When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again. \n"
    26: '²⁶ However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the
      camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet
      the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp. '
    27: "²⁷ A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the\
      \ camp.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and\
      \ said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” \n"
    29: '²⁹ But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord’s
      people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!” '
    30: "³⁰ Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp. \n"
    31: '³¹ Now a wind went out from the Lord and drove quail in from the sea. It
      scattered them up to two cubits deep all around the camp, as far as a day’s
      walk in any direction. '
    32: '³² All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered
      quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around
      the camp. '
    33: '³³ But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be
      consumed, the anger of the Lord burned against the people, and he struck them
      with a severe plague. '
    34: "³⁴ Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried\
      \ the people who had craved other food. \n"
    35: ³⁵ From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
  12:
    1: '¹ Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife,
      for he had married a Cushite. '
    2: "² “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken\
      \ through us?” And the Lord heard this. \n"
    3: "³ (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face\
      \ of the earth.) \n"
    4: '⁴ At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the tent
      of meeting, all three of you.” So the three of them went out. '
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to
      the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, '
    6: "⁶ he said, “Listen to my words:\n“When there is a prophet among you,\n   \
      \ I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions,\n    I speak to them in dreams.\n"
    7: "⁷ But this is not true of my servant Moses;\n    he is faithful in all my\
      \ house.\n"
    8: "⁸ With him I speak face to face,\n    clearly and not in riddles;\n    he\
      \ sees the form of the Lord.\nWhy then were you not afraid\n    to speak against\
      \ my servant Moses?” \n"
    9: "⁹ The anger of the Lord burned against them, and he left them. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous—it
      became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling
      skin disease, '
    11: '¹¹ and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against
      us the sin we have so foolishly committed. '
    12: "¹² Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb\
      \ with its flesh half eaten away.” \n"
    13: "¹³ So Moses cried out to the Lord, “Please, God, heal her!” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would
      she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for
      seven days; after that she can be brought back.” '
    15: "¹⁵ So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people\
      \ did not move on till she was brought back. \n"
    16: ¹⁶ After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
  13:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites.\
      \ From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.” \n"
    3: '³ So at the Lord’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All
      of them were leaders of the Israelites. '
    4: "⁴ These are their names:\nfrom the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur;\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; \n"
    6: "⁶ from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; \n"
    7: "⁷ from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; \n"
    8: "⁸ from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; \n"
    9: "⁹ from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; \n"
    11: "¹¹ from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; \n"
    12: "¹² from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; \n"
    13: "¹³ from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses\
      \ gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev
      and on into the hill country. '
    18: '¹⁸ See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong
      or weak, few or many. '
    19: '¹⁹ What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns
      do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? '
    20: "²⁰ How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not?\
      \ Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season\
      \ for the first ripe grapes.) \n"
    21: '²¹ So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as
      Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. '
    22: '²² They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai
      and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years
      before Zoan in Egypt.) '
    23: '²³ When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, they cut off a branch bearing
      a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along
      with some pomegranates and figs. '
    24: '²⁴ That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes
      the Israelites cut off there. '
    25: "²⁵ At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land. \n"
    26: '²⁶ They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at
      Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole
      assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. '
    27: '²⁷ They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent
      us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. '
    28: '²⁸ But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified
      and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. '
    29: "²⁹ The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites\
      \ live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the\
      \ Jordan.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up\
      \ and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” \n"
    31: '³¹ But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people;
      they are stronger than we are.” '
    32: '³² And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they
      had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All
      the people we saw there are of great size. '
    33: ³³ We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim).
      We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”
  14:
    1: '¹ That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept
      aloud. '
    2: '² All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly
      said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! '
    3: '³ Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword?
      Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us
      to go back to Egypt?” '
    4: "⁴ And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly
      gathered there. '
    6: '⁶ Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had
      explored the land, tore their clothes '
    7: '⁷ and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and
      explored is exceedingly good. '
    8: '⁸ If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing
      with milk and honey, and will give it to us. '
    9: "⁹ Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of\
      \ the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the Lord\
      \ is with us. Do not be afraid of them.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the
      Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites. '
    11: '¹¹ The Lord said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with contempt?
      How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have
      performed among them? '
    12: "¹² I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make\
      \ you into a nation greater and stronger than they.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Moses said to the Lord, “Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your
      power you brought these people up from among them. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already
      heard that you, Lord, are with these people and that you, Lord, have been seen
      face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in
      a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. '
    15: '¹⁵ If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations
      who have heard this report about you will say, '
    16: "¹⁶ ‘The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised\
      \ them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared: '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion.
      Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the
      sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’ '
    19: "¹⁹ In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just\
      \ as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ The Lord replied, “I have forgiven them, as you asked. '
    21: '²¹ Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord
      fills the whole earth, '
    22: '²² not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and
      in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times— '
    23: '²³ not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors.
      No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. '
    24: '²⁴ But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly,
      I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit
      it. '
    25: "²⁵ Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn\
      \ back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.”\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: '
    27: '²⁷ “How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard
      the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. '
    28: '²⁸ So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you
      the very thing I heard you say: '
    29: '²⁹ In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years
      old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. '
    30: '³⁰ Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make
      your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. '
    31: '³¹ As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring
      them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. '
    32: '³² But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. '
    33: '³³ Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your
      unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. '
    34: '³⁴ For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you
      will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’ '
    35: "³⁵ I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole\
      \ wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their\
      \ end in this wilderness; here they will die.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the
      whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it— '
    37: '³⁷ these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the
      land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord. '
    38: "³⁸ Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb\
      \ son of Jephunneh survived. \n"
    39: '³⁹ When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill\
      \ country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised.\
      \ Surely we have sinned!” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the Lord’s command? This will
      not succeed! '
    42: '⁴² Do not go up, because the Lord is not with you. You will be defeated by
      your enemies, '
    43: "⁴³ for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you\
      \ have turned away from the Lord, he will not be with you and you will fall\
      \ by the sword.” \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point
      in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord’s covenant
      moved from the camp. '
    45: ⁴⁵ Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came
      down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
  15:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land I am
      giving you as a home '
    3: '³ and you present to the Lord food offerings from the herd or the flock, as
      an aroma pleasing to the Lord—whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special
      vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings— '
    4: '⁴ then the person who brings an offering shall present to the Lord a grain
      offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of
      a hin of olive oil. '
    5: "⁵ With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter\
      \ of a hin of wine as a drink offering. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest
      flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil, '
    7: "⁷ and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a
      special vow or a fellowship offering to the Lord, '
    9: '⁹ bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the
      finest flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil, '
    10: '¹⁰ and also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. This will be a
      food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner. '
    12: "¹² Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when they
      present a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ For the generations to come, whenever a foreigner or anyone else living
      among you presents a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord, they must
      do exactly as you do. '
    15: '¹⁵ The community is to have the same rules for you and for the foreigner
      residing among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
      You and the foreigner shall be the same before the Lord: '
    16: "¹⁶ The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigner\
      \ residing among you.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord said to Moses, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land to
      which I am taking you '
    19: '¹⁹ and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to
      the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Present a loaf from the first of your ground meal and present it as an
      offering from the threshing floor. '
    21: "²¹ Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the\
      \ Lord from the first of your ground meal. \n"
    22: '²² “‘Now if you as a community unintentionally fail to keep any of these
      commands the Lord gave Moses— '
    23: '²³ any of the Lord’s commands to you through him, from the day the Lord gave
      them and continuing through the generations to come— '
    24: '²⁴ and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware
      of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering
      as an aroma pleasing to the Lord, along with its prescribed grain offering and
      drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and
      they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have presented to
      the Lord for their wrong a food offering and a sin offering. '
    26: "²⁶ The whole Israelite community and the foreigners residing among them will\
      \ be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “‘But if just one person sins unintentionally, that person must bring
      a year-old female goat for a sin offering. '
    28: '²⁸ The priest is to make atonement before the Lord for the one who erred
      by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made, that person will
      be forgiven. '
    29: "²⁹ One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether\
      \ a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “‘But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, blasphemes
      the Lord and must be cut off from the people of Israel. '
    31: "³¹ Because they have despised the Lord’s word and broken his commands, they\
      \ must surely be cut off; their guilt remains on them.’” \n"
    32: '³² While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering
      wood on the Sabbath day. '
    33: '³³ Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and
      the whole assembly, '
    34: '³⁴ and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be
      done to him. '
    35: '³⁵ Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must
      stone him outside the camp.” '
    36: "³⁶ So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as\
      \ the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    37: '³⁷ The Lord said to Moses, '
    38: '³⁸ “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Throughout the generations
      to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue
      cord on each tassel. '
    39: '³⁹ You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the
      commands of the Lord, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by
      chasing after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated
      to your God. '
    41: ⁴¹ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I
      am the Lord your God.’”
  16:
    1: '¹ Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites—Dathan
      and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—became insolent '
    2: '² and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known
      community leaders who had been appointed members of the council. '
    3: "³ They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have\
      \ gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the Lord\
      \ is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord’s assembly?” \n"
    4: '⁴ When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. '
    5: '⁵ Then he said to Korah and all his followers: “In the morning the Lord will
      show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near
      him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him. '
    6: '⁶ You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers '
    7: "⁷ and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the Lord. The\
      \ man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too\
      \ far!” \n"
    8: '⁸ Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites! '
    9: '⁹ Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the
      rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work
      at the Lord’s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them? '
    10: '¹⁰ He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you
      are trying to get the priesthood too. '
    11: "¹¹ It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together.\
      \ Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said,
      “We will not come! '
    13: '¹³ Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with
      milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it
      over us! '
    14: "¹⁴ Moreover, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey\
      \ or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these\
      \ men like slaves? No, we will not come!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, “Do not accept their\
      \ offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged\
      \ any of them.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before
      the Lord tomorrow—you and they and Aaron. '
    17: '¹⁷ Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and
      present it before the Lord. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it,
      and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the
      entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire
      assembly. '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    21: "²¹ “Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at\
      \ once.” \n"
    22: "²² But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, the God who gives\
      \ breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when\
      \ only one man sins?” \n"
    23: '²³ Then the Lord said to Moses, '
    24: "²⁴ “Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed
      him. '
    26: '²⁶ He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men!
      Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of
      all their sins.” '
    27: "²⁷ So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan\
      \ and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little\
      \ ones at the entrances to their tents. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me
      to do all these things and that it was not my idea: '
    29: '²⁹ If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then
      the Lord has not sent me. '
    30: "³⁰ But if the Lord brings about something totally new, and the earth opens\
      \ its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they\
      \ go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men\
      \ have treated the Lord with contempt.” \n"
    31: '³¹ As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart '
    32: '³² and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households,
      and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions. '
    33: '³³ They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they
      owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the
      community. '
    34: "³⁴ At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth\
      \ is going to swallow us too!” \n"
    35: "³⁵ And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the 250 men who were offering\
      \ the incense. \n"
    36: '³⁶ The Lord said to Moses, '
    37: '³⁷ “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the
      charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are
      holy— '
    38: "³⁸ the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the\
      \ censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the\
      \ Lord and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who
      had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, '
    40: "⁴⁰ as the Lord directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites\
      \ that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before\
      \ the Lord, or he would become like Korah and his followers. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and\
      \ Aaron. “You have killed the Lord’s people,” they said. \n"
    42: '⁴² But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned
      toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the
      Lord appeared. '
    43: '⁴³ Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting, '
    44: '⁴⁴ and the Lord said to Moses, '
    45: "⁴⁵ “Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And\
      \ they fell facedown. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along
      with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement
      for them. Wrath has come out from the Lord; the plague has started.” '
    47: '⁴⁷ So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The
      plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and
      made atonement for them. '
    48: '⁴⁸ He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. '
    49: '⁴⁹ But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died
      because of Korah. '
    50: ⁵⁰ Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for
      the plague had stopped.
  17:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader
      of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. '
    3: '³ On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for
      the head of each ancestral tribe. '
    4: '⁴ Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law,
      where I meet with you. '
    5: "⁵ The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself\
      \ of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs,
      one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was
      among them. '
    7: "⁷ Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the covenant law.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented
      the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced
      almonds. '
    9: "⁹ Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the Lord’s presence to all the\
      \ Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the ark of
      the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end
      to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.” '
    11: "¹¹ Moses did just as the Lord commanded him. \n"
    12: '¹² The Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all lost! '
    13: ¹³ Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord will die. Are we
      all going to die?”
  18:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Aaron, “You, your sons and your family are to bear the
      responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons
      alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood. '
    2: '² Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist
      you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law. '
    3: '³ They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the
      tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar.
      Otherwise both they and you will die. '
    4: "⁴ They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting—all\
      \ the work at the tent—and no one else may come near where you are. \n"
    5: '⁵ “You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar,
      so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again. '
    6: '⁶ I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as
      a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord to do the work at the tent of meeting. '
    7: "⁷ But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything\
      \ at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood\
      \ as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord said to Aaron, “I myself have put you in charge of the offerings
      presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you
      and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share. '
    9: '⁹ You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the
      fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain
      or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons. '
    10: "¹⁰ Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard\
      \ it as holy. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave\
      \ offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters\
      \ as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean\
      \ may eat it. \n"
    12: '¹² “I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain
      they give the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest. '
    13: "¹³ All the land’s firstfruits that they bring to the Lord will be yours.\
      \ Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Everything in Israel that is devoted to the Lord is yours. '
    15: '¹⁵ The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered
      to the Lord is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn
      male of unclean animals. '
    16: "¹⁶ When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price\
      \ set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs\
      \ twenty gerahs. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they
      are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food
      offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and
      the right thigh are yours. '
    19: "¹⁹ Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to\
      \ the Lord I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share.\
      \ It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your\
      \ offspring.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ The Lord said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor\
      \ will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among\
      \ the Israelites. \n"
    21: '²¹ “I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in
      return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting. '
    22: '²² From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they
      will bear the consequences of their sin and will die. '
    23: '²³ It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear
      the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting
      ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among
      the Israelites. '
    24: "²⁴ Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the\
      \ Israelites present as an offering to the Lord. That is why I said concerning\
      \ them: ‘They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.’” \n"
    25: '²⁵ The Lord said to Moses, '
    26: '²⁶ “Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites
      the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe
      as the Lord’s offering. '
    27: '²⁷ Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor
      or juice from the winepress. '
    28: '²⁸ In this way you also will present an offering to the Lord from all the
      tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the
      Lord’s portion to Aaron the priest. '
    29: "²⁹ You must present as the Lord’s portion the best and holiest part of everything\
      \ given to you.’ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Say to the Levites: ‘When you present the best part, it will be reckoned
      to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress. '
    31: '³¹ You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your
      wages for your work at the tent of meeting. '
    32: ³² By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter;
      then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will
      not die.’”
  19:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: '
    2: '² “This is a requirement of the law that the Lord has commanded: Tell the
      Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has
      never been under a yoke. '
    3: '³ Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered
      in his presence. '
    4: '⁴ Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle
      it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting. '
    5: '⁵ While he watches, the heifer is to be burned—its hide, flesh, blood and
      intestines. '
    6: '⁶ The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw
      them onto the burning heifer. '
    7: '⁷ After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water.
      He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening. '
    8: "⁸ The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and\
      \ he too will be unclean till evening. \n"
    9: '⁹ “A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them
      in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite
      community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin. '
    10: "¹⁰ The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes,\
      \ and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance\
      \ both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days. '
    12: '¹² They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the
      seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on
      the third and seventh days, they will not be clean. '
    13: "¹³ If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they\
      \ defile the Lord’s tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Because the\
      \ water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, they are unclean; their\
      \ uncleanness remains on them. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who
      enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days, '
    15: "¹⁵ and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a\
      \ sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human\
      \ bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering
      into a jar and pour fresh water over them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in
      the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were
      there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave
      or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death. '
    19: '¹⁹ The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third
      and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are
      being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening
      they will be clean. '
    20: '²⁰ But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut
      off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord.
      The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean. '
    21: "²¹ This is a lasting ordinance for them.\n“The man who sprinkles the water\
      \ of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water\
      \ of cleansing will be unclean till evening. "
    22: ²² Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who
      touches it becomes unclean till evening.”
  20:
    1: "¹ In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of\
      \ Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. \n"
    2: '² Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition
      to Moses and Aaron. '
    3: '³ They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers
      fell dead before the Lord! '
    4: '⁴ Why did you bring the Lord’s community into this wilderness, that we and
      our livestock should die here? '
    5: "⁵ Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain\
      \ or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting
      and fell facedown, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord said to Moses, '
    8: "⁸ “Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together.\
      \ Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will\
      \ bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock\
      \ can drink.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Moses took the staff from the Lord’s presence, just as he commanded him. '
    10: '¹⁰ He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses
      said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” '
    11: "¹¹ Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water\
      \ gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. \n"
    12: "¹² But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me\
      \ enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring\
      \ this community into the land I give them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with\
      \ the Lord and where he was proved holy among them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:\n“This\
      \ is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have\
      \ come on us. "
    15: '¹⁵ Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The
      Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors, '
    16: "¹⁶ but when we cried out to the Lord, he heard our cry and sent an angel\
      \ and brought us out of Egypt.\n“Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge\
      \ of your territory. "
    17: "¹⁷ Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field\
      \ or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s\
      \ Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through\
      \ your territory.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But Edom answered:\n“You may not pass through here; if you try, we will\
      \ march out and attack you with the sword.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Israelites replied:\n“We will go along the main road, and if we or\
      \ our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to\
      \ pass through on foot—nothing else.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Again they answered:\n“You may not pass through.”\nThen Edom came out\
      \ against them with a large and powerful army. "
    21: "²¹ Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned\
      \ away from them. \n"
    22: '²² The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. '
    23: '²³ At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    24: '²⁴ “Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give
      the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters
      of Meribah. '
    25: '²⁵ Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. '
    26: "²⁶ Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will\
      \ be gathered to his people; he will die there.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Moses did as the Lord commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of
      the whole community. '
    28: '²⁸ Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron
      died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the
      mountain, '
    29: ²⁹ and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites
      mourned for him thirty days.
  21:
    1: '¹ When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel
      was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured
      some of them. '
    2: '² Then Israel made this vow to the Lord: “If you will deliver these people
      into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities.” '
    3: "³ The Lord listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them.\
      \ They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around
      Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way; '
    5: "⁵ they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought\
      \ us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no\
      \ water! And we detest this miserable food!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many
      Israelites died. '
    7: "⁷ The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the\
      \ Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.”\
      \ So Moses prayed for the people. \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who
      is bitten can look at it and live.” '
    9: "⁹ So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was\
      \ bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. '
    11: '¹¹ Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness
      that faces Moab toward the sunrise. '
    12: '¹² From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley. '
    13: '¹³ They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the
      wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab,
      between Moab and the Amorites. '
    14: "¹⁴ That is why the Book of the Wars of the Lord says:\n“. . . Zahab in Suphah\
      \ and the ravines,\n    the Arnon "
    15: "¹⁵ and the slopes of the ravines\nthat lead to the settlement of Ar\n   \
      \ and lie along the border of Moab.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the Lord said to\
      \ Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then Israel sang this song:\n“Spring up, O well!\n    Sing about it,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ about the well that the princes dug,\n    that the nobles of the people\
      \ sank—\n    the nobles with scepters and staffs.”\nThen they went from the\
      \ wilderness to Mattanah, "
    19: '¹⁹ from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, '
    20: "²⁰ and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks\
      \ the wasteland. \n"
    21: "²¹ Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites: \n"
    22: "²² “Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field\
      \ or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s\
      \ Highway until we have passed through your territory.” \n"
    23: '²³ But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered
      his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he
      reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel. '
    24: '²⁴ Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the
      Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border
      was fortified. '
    25: '²⁵ Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including
      Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements. '
    26: "²⁶ Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against\
      \ the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the\
      \ Arnon. \n"
    27: "²⁷ That is why the poets say:\n“Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt;\n\
      \    let Sihon’s city be restored. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “Fire went out from Heshbon,\n    a blaze from the city of Sihon.\nIt\
      \ consumed Ar of Moab,\n    the citizens of Arnon’s heights.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Woe to you, Moab!\n    You are destroyed, people of Chemosh!\nHe has given\
      \ up his sons as fugitives\n    and his daughters as captives\n    to Sihon\
      \ king of the Amorites. \n"
    30: "³⁰ “But we have overthrown them;\n    Heshbon’s dominion has been destroyed\
      \ all the way to Dibon.\nWe have demolished them as far as Nophah,\n    which\
      \ extends to Medeba.” \n"
    31: "³¹ So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. \n"
    32: '³² After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding
      settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there. '
    33: "³³ Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king\
      \ of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered\
      \ him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what\
      \ you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” \n"
    35: ³⁵ So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving
      them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the\
      \ Jordan across from Jericho. \n"
    2: '² Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, '
    3: "³ and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was\
      \ filled with dread because of the Israelites. \n"
    4: "⁴ The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick\
      \ up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.”\nSo Balak\
      \ son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, "
    5: "⁵ sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the\
      \ Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said:\n“A people has come out of\
      \ Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. "
    6: "⁶ Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful\
      \ for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the\
      \ land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse\
      \ is cursed.” \n"
    7: "⁷ The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination.\
      \ When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to\
      \ you with the answer the Lord gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with\
      \ him. \n"
    9: "⁹ God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: '
    11: "¹¹ ‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now\
      \ come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight\
      \ them and drive them away.’” \n"
    12: "¹² But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse\
      \ on those people, because they are blessed.” \n"
    13: "¹³ The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back\
      \ to your own country, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to\
      \ come with us.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished
      than the first. '
    16: "¹⁶ They came to Balaam and said:\n“This is what Balak son of Zippor says:\
      \ Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, "
    17: "¹⁷ because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and\
      \ put a curse on these people for me.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold
      in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command
      of the Lord my God. '
    19: "¹⁹ Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the Lord will\
      \ tell me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to\
      \ summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite
      officials. '
    22: '²² But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in
      the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants
      were with him. '
    23: "²³ When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a\
      \ drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat\
      \ it to get it back on the road. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path through the vineyards,
      with walls on both sides. '
    25: "²⁵ When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it pressed close to the wall,\
      \ crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place
      where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. '
    27: '²⁷ When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it lay down under Balaam, and
      he was angry and beat it with his staff. '
    28: "²⁸ Then the Lord opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What\
      \ have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had\
      \ a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always\
      \ ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?”\n“No,”\
      \ he said. \n"
    31: "³¹ Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing\
      \ in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. \n"
    32: '³² The angel of the Lord asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these
      three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless
      one before me. '
    33: "³³ The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had\
      \ not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have\
      \ spared it.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned. I did not realize\
      \ you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will\
      \ go back.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only\
      \ what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials. \n"
    36: '³⁶ When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the
      Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. '
    37: "³⁷ Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t\
      \ you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?” \n"
    38: "³⁸ “Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever\
      \ I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials
      who were with him. '
    41: ⁴¹ The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he
      could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.
  23:
    1: '¹ Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven
      rams for me.” '
    2: "² Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on\
      \ each altar. \n"
    3: "³ Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside.\
      \ Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will\
      \ tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height. \n"
    4: "⁴ God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on\
      \ each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give\
      \ him this word.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with
      all the Moabite officials. '
    7: "⁷ Then Balaam spoke his message:\n“Balak brought me from Aram,\n    the king\
      \ of Moab from the eastern mountains.\n‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me;\n\
      \    come, denounce Israel.’\n"
    8: "⁸ How can I curse\n    those whom God has not cursed?\nHow can I denounce\n\
      \    those whom the Lord has not denounced?\n"
    9: "⁹ From the rocky peaks I see them,\n    from the heights I view them.\nI see\
      \ a people who live apart\n    and do not consider themselves one of the nations.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who can count the dust of Jacob\n    or number even a fourth of Israel?\n\
      Let me die the death of the righteous,\n    and may my final end be like theirs!”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse\
      \ my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!” \n"
    12: "¹² He answered, “Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see
      them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from
      there, curse them for me.” '
    14: "¹⁴ So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there\
      \ he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with\
      \ him over there.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go back\
      \ to Balak and give him this word.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the\
      \ Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the Lord say?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then he spoke his message:\n“Arise, Balak, and listen;\n    hear me, son\
      \ of Zippor.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ God is not human, that he should lie,\n    not a human being, that he\
      \ should change his mind.\nDoes he speak and then not act?\n    Does he promise\
      \ and not fulfill?\n"
    20: "²⁰ I have received a command to bless;\n    he has blessed, and I cannot\
      \ change it. \n"
    21: "²¹ “No misfortune is seen in Jacob,\n    no misery observed in Israel.\n\
      The Lord their God is with them;\n    the shout of the King is among them.\n"
    22: "²² God brought them out of Egypt;\n    they have the strength of a wild ox.\n"
    23: "²³ There is no divination against Jacob,\n    no evil omens against Israel.\n\
      It will now be said of Jacob\n    and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’\n"
    24: "²⁴ The people rise like a lioness;\n    they rouse themselves like a lion\n\
      that does not rest till it devours its prey\n    and drinks the blood of its\
      \ victims.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at\
      \ all!” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the Lord says?”\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps
      it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.” '
    28: "²⁸ And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and
      seven rams for me.” '
    30: ³⁰ Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
  24:
    1: '¹ Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not
      resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness. '
    2: '² When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit
      of God came on him '
    3: "³ and he spoke his message:\n“The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,\n    the\
      \ prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,\n"
    4: "⁴ the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,\n    who sees a vision from\
      \ the Almighty,\n    who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: \n"
    5: "⁵ “How beautiful are your tents, Jacob,\n    your dwelling places, Israel!\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ “Like valleys they spread out,\n    like gardens beside a river,\nlike aloes\
      \ planted by the Lord,\n    like cedars beside the waters.\n"
    7: "⁷ Water will flow from their buckets;\n    their seed will have abundant water.\n\
      “Their king will be greater than Agag;\n    their kingdom will be exalted. \n"
    8: "⁸ “God brought them out of Egypt;\n    they have the strength of a wild ox.\n\
      They devour hostile nations\n    and break their bones in pieces;\n    with\
      \ their arrows they pierce them.\n"
    9: "⁹ Like a lion they crouch and lie down,\n    like a lioness—who dares to rouse\
      \ them?\n“May those who bless you be blessed\n    and those who curse you be\
      \ cursed!” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together
      and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them
      these three times. '
    11: "¹¹ Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but\
      \ the Lord has kept you from being rewarded.” \n"
    12: '¹² Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, '
    13: '¹³ ‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could
      not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the
      Lord—and I must say only what the Lord says’? '
    14: "¹⁴ Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this\
      \ people will do to your people in days to come.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then he spoke his message:\n“The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,\n   \
      \ the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,\n    who has knowledge\
      \ from the Most High,\nwho sees a vision from the Almighty,\n    who falls prostrate,\
      \ and whose eyes are opened: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “I see him, but not now;\n    I behold him, but not near.\nA star will\
      \ come out of Jacob;\n    a scepter will rise out of Israel.\nHe will crush\
      \ the foreheads of Moab,\n    the skulls of all the people of Sheth.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Edom will be conquered;\n    Seir, his enemy, will be conquered,\n   \
      \ but Israel will grow strong.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A ruler will come out of Jacob\n    and destroy the survivors of the city.”\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message:\n“Amalek was first among\
      \ the nations,\n    but their end will be utter destruction.” \n"
    21: "²¹ Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message:\n“Your dwelling place is\
      \ secure,\n    your nest is set in a rock;\n"
    22: "²² yet you Kenites will be destroyed\n    when Ashur takes you captive.”\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Then he spoke his message:\n“Alas! Who can live when God does this?\n"
    24: "²⁴     Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus;\nthey will subdue Ashur\
      \ and Eber,\n    but they too will come to ruin.” \n"
    25: ²⁵ Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
  25:
    1: '¹ While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual
      immorality with Moabite women, '
    2: '² who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial
      meal and bowed down before these gods. '
    3: "³ So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the Lord’s anger burned\
      \ against them. \n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill them\
      \ and expose them in broad daylight before the Lord, so that the Lord’s fierce\
      \ anger may turn away from Israel.” \n"
    5: "⁵ So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of\
      \ your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before
      the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at
      the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    7: '⁷ When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he
      left the assembly, took a spear in his hand '
    8: '⁸ and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of
      them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the
      plague against the Israelites was stopped; '
    9: "⁹ but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord said to Moses, '
    11: '¹¹ “Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my
      anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them
      as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. '
    12: '¹² Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. '
    13: "¹³ He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because\
      \ he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was
      Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter\
      \ of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them. '
    18: ¹⁸ They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident
      involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman
      who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”
  26:
    1: '¹ After the plague the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, '
    2: '² “Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty
      years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.” '
    3: '³ So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar
      the priest spoke with them and said, '
    4: "⁴ “Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the Lord commanded\
      \ Moses.”\nThese were the Israelites who came out of Egypt: \n"
    5: "⁵ The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were:\nthrough Hanok,\

    6: "⁶ through Hezron, the Hezronite clan;\nthrough Karmi, the Karmite clan. \n"
    7: "⁷ These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730. \n"
    8: '⁸ The son of Pallu was Eliab, '
    9: '⁹ and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and
      Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and
      were among Korah’s followers when they rebelled against the Lord. '
    10: '¹⁰ The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose
      followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning

    8: '⁸ “Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance

    2: '² “Give this command to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Make sure that you
      present to me at the appointed time my food offerings, as an aroma pleasing
      to me.’ '
    3: '³ Say to them: ‘This is the food offering you are to present to the Lord:
      two lambs a year old without defect, as a regular burnt offering each day. '
    4: '⁴ Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight, '
    5: '⁵ together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour
      mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives. '
    6: '⁶ This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing
      aroma, a food offering presented to the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented
      drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the Lord at the sanctuary. '
    8: "⁸ Offer the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering\
      \ and drink offering that you offer in the morning. This is a food offering,\
      \ an aroma pleasing to the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect,
      together with its drink offering and a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah
      of the finest flour mixed with olive oil. '
    10: "¹⁰ This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular\
      \ burnt offering and its drink offering. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘On the first of every month, present to the Lord a burnt offering of
      two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect. '
    12: '¹² With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah
      of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a grain offering of two-tenths
      of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; '
    13: '¹³ and with each lamb, a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest
      flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food
      offering presented to the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin of wine;
      with the ram, a third of a hin; and with each lamb, a quarter of a hin. This
      is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year. '
    15: "¹⁵ Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat\
      \ is to be presented to the Lord as a sin offering. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘On the fourteenth day of the first month the Lord’s Passover is to be
      held. '
    17: '¹⁷ On the fifteenth day of this month there is to be a festival; for seven
      days eat bread made without yeast. '
    18: '¹⁸ On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. '
    19: '¹⁹ Present to the Lord a food offering consisting of a burnt offering of
      two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect. '
    20: '²⁰ With each bull offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of the
      finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths; '
    21: '²¹ and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth. '
    22: '²² Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. '
    23: '²³ Offer these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering. '
    24: '²⁴ In this way present the food offering every day for seven days as an aroma
      pleasing to the Lord; it is to be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering
      and its drink offering. '
    25: "²⁵ On the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘On the day of firstfruits, when you present to the Lord an offering
      of new grain during the Festival of Weeks, hold a sacred assembly and do no
      regular work. '
    27: '²⁷ Present a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs
      a year old as an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah
      of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths; '
    29: '²⁹ and with each of the seven lambs, one-tenth. '
    30: '³⁰ Include one male goat to make atonement for you. '
    31: ³¹ Offer these together with their drink offerings, in addition to the regular

    5: '⁵ Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. '
    6: "⁶ These are in addition to the monthly and daily burnt offerings with their\
      \ grain offerings and drink offerings as specified. They are food offerings\
      \ presented to the Lord, a pleasing aroma. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘On the tenth day of this seventh month hold a sacred assembly. You must
      deny yourselves and do no work. '
    8: '⁸ Present as an aroma pleasing to the Lord a burnt offering of one young bull,
      one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect. '

    13: '¹³ Present as an aroma pleasing to the Lord a food offering consisting of
      a burnt offering of thirteen young bulls, two rams and fourteen male lambs a
      year old, all without defect. '
    14: '¹⁴ With each of the thirteen bulls offer a grain offering of three-tenths

    40: ⁴⁰ Moses told the Israelites all that the Lord commanded him.
  30:
    1: '¹ Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: “This is what the Lord
      commands: '
    2: "² When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to obligate himself\
      \ by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said. \n"
    3: '³ “When a young woman still living in her father’s household makes a vow to
      the Lord or obligates herself by a pledge '
    4: '⁴ and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then
      all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand. '
    5: "⁵ But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or\
      \ the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the Lord will release\
      \ her because her father has forbidden her. \n"
    6: '⁶ “If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise
      by which she obligates herself '
    7: '⁷ and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or
      the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand. '
    8: "⁸ But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the\
      \ vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself,\
      \ and the Lord will release her. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding\
      \ on her. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by
      a pledge under oath '
    11: '¹¹ and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid
      her, then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand. '
    12: '¹² But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them, then none
      of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified
      them, and the Lord will release her. '
    13: '¹³ Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge
      to deny herself. '
    14: '¹⁴ But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then
      he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by
      saying nothing to her when he hears about them. '
    15: "¹⁵ If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then\
      \ he must bear the consequences of her wrongdoing.” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships
      between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still
      living at home.
  31:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will\
      \ be gathered to your people.” \n"
    3: '³ So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against
      the Midianites so that they may carry out the Lord’s vengeance on them. '
    4: '⁴ Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.” '
    5: '⁵ So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were
      supplied from the clans of Israel. '
    6: "⁶ Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas\
      \ son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary\
      \ and the trumpets for signaling. \n"
    7: '⁷ They fought against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and killed every
      man. '
    8: '⁸ Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of
      Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. '
    9: '⁹ The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the
      Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. '
    10: '¹⁰ They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as
      all their camps. '
    11: '¹¹ They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, '
    12: "¹² and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the\
      \ priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by\
      \ the Jordan across from Jericho. \n"
    13: '¹³ Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to
      meet them outside the camp. '
    14: "¹⁴ Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands\
      \ and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. '
    16: '¹⁶ “They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites
      to be unfaithful to the Lord in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the
      Lord’s people. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, '
    18: "¹⁸ but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must
      stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify
      yourselves and your captives. '
    20: "²⁰ Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair\
      \ or wood.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle,
      “This is what is required by the law that the Lord gave Moses: '
    22: '²² Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead '
    23: '²³ and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire,
      and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing.
      And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. '
    24: "²⁴ On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may\
      \ come into the camp.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ The Lord said to Moses, '
    26: '²⁶ “You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are
      to count all the people and animals that were captured. '
    27: '²⁷ Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle
      and the rest of the community. '
    28: '²⁸ From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the
      Lord one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep. '
    29: '²⁹ Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest
      as the Lord’s part. '
    30: '³⁰ From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people,
      cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible
      for the care of the Lord’s tabernacle.” '
    31: "³¹ So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    32: '³² The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000
      sheep, '
    33: '³³ 72,000 cattle, '
    34: '³⁴ 61,000 donkeys '
    35: "³⁵ and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man. \n"
    36: "³⁶ The half share of those who fought in the battle was:\n337,500 sheep, "
    37: "³⁷ of which the tribute for the Lord was 675; \n"
    38: "³⁸ 36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the Lord was 72; \n"
    39: "³⁹ 30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the Lord was 61; \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ 16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the Lord was 32. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the Lord’s part, as the\
      \ Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    42: '⁴² The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that
      of the fighting men— '
    43: '⁴³ the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep, '
    44: '⁴⁴ 36,000 cattle, '
    45: '⁴⁵ 30,500 donkeys '
    46: '⁴⁶ and 16,000 people. '
    47: "⁴⁷ From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people\
      \ and animals, as the Lord commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who\
      \ were responsible for the care of the Lord’s tabernacle. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of
      thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses '
    49: '⁴⁹ and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command,
      and not one is missing. '
    50: "⁵⁰ So we have brought as an offering to the Lord the gold articles each of\
      \ us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make\
      \ atonement for ourselves before the Lord.” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted
      articles. '
    52: '⁵² All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
      that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the Lord weighed 16,750 shekels. '
    53: '⁵³ Each soldier had taken plunder for himself. '
    54: ⁵⁴ Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands
      and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial
      for the Israelites before the Lord.
  32:
    1: '¹ The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that
      the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. '
    2: '² So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community,
      and said, '
    3: '³ “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— '
    4: '⁴ the land the Lord subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock,
      and your servants have livestock. '
    5: "⁵ If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given\
      \ to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites
      go to war while you sit here? '
    7: '⁷ Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the
      Lord has given them? '
    8: '⁸ This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look
      over the land. '
    9: '⁹ After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged
      the Israelites from entering the land the Lord had given them. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath: '
    11: '¹¹ ‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who
      were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land
      I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— '
    12: '¹² not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of
      Nun, for they followed the Lord wholeheartedly.’ '
    13: "¹³ The Lord’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the\
      \ wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil\
      \ in his sight was gone. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers
      and making the Lord even more angry with Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people\
      \ in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for
      our livestock and cities for our women and children. '
    17: '¹⁷ But we will arm ourselves for battle and go ahead of the Israelites until
      we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live
      in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land. '
    18: '¹⁸ We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received
      their inheritance. '
    19: "¹⁹ We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the\
      \ Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves
      before the Lord for battle '
    21: '²¹ and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the Lord
      until he has driven his enemies out before him— '
    22: "²² then when the land is subdued before the Lord, you may return and be free\
      \ from your obligation to the Lord and to Israel. And this land will be your\
      \ possession before the Lord. \n"
    23: '²³ “But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the Lord; and
      you may be sure that your sin will find you out. '
    24: "²⁴ Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but\
      \ do what you have promised.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as
      our lord commands. '
    26: '²⁶ Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities
      of Gilead. '
    27: "²⁷ But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over\
      \ to fight before the Lord, just as our lord says.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son
      of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. '
    29: '²⁹ He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle,
      cross over the Jordan with you before the Lord, then when the land is subdued
      before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession. '
    30: "³⁰ But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession\
      \ with you in Canaan.” \n"
    31: '³¹ The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the Lord
      has said. '
    32: "³² We will cross over before the Lord into Canaan armed, but the property\
      \ we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.” \n"
    33: "³³ Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh\
      \ son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of\
      \ Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around\
      \ them. \n"
    34: '³⁴ The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, '
    35: '³⁵ Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, '
    36: '³⁶ Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their
      flocks. '
