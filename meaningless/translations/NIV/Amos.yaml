Amos:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa—the vision he saw concerning\
      \ Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and\
      \ Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. \n"
    2: "² He said:\n“The Lord roars from Zion\n    and thunders from Jerusalem;\n\
      the pastures of the shepherds dry up,\n    and the top of Carmel withers.” \n"
    3: "³ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Damascus,\n    even for\
      \ four, I will not relent.\nBecause she threshed Gilead\n    with sledges having\
      \ iron teeth,\n"
    4: "⁴ I will send fire on the house of Hazael\n    that will consume the fortresses\
      \ of Ben-Hadad.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will break down the gate of Damascus;\n    I will destroy the king who\
      \ is in the Valley of Aven\nand the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden.\n\
      \    The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,”\nsays the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Gaza,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause she took captive whole communities\n    and sold\
      \ them to Edom,\n"
    7: "⁷ I will send fire on the walls of Gaza\n    that will consume her fortresses.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will destroy the king of Ashdod\n    and the one who holds the scepter\
      \ in Ashkelon.\nI will turn my hand against Ekron,\n    till the last of the\
      \ Philistines are dead,”\nsays the Sovereign Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Tyre,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause she sold whole communities of captives to Edom,\n\
      \    disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will send fire on the walls of Tyre\n    that will consume her fortresses.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Edom,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause he pursued his brother with a sword\n    and slaughtered\
      \ the women of the land,\nbecause his anger raged continually\n    and his fury\
      \ flamed unchecked,\n"
    12: "¹² I will send fire on Teman\n    that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Ammon,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead\n\
      \    in order to extend his borders,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah\n    that will consume her fortresses\n\
      amid war cries on the day of battle,\n    amid violent winds on a stormy day.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Her king will go into exile,\n    he and his officials together,”\nsays\
      \ the Lord."
  2:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Moab,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause he burned to ashes\n    the bones of Edom’s king,\n"
    2: "² I will send fire on Moab\n    that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth.\n\
      Moab will go down in great tumult\n    amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.\n"
    3: "³ I will destroy her ruler\n    and kill all her officials with him,”\nsays\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Judah,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nBecause they have rejected the law of the Lord\n    and\
      \ have not kept his decrees,\nbecause they have been led astray by false gods,\n\
      \    the gods their ancestors followed,\n"
    5: "⁵ I will send fire on Judah\n    that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.”\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“For three sins of Israel,\n    even for four,\
      \ I will not relent.\nThey sell the innocent for silver,\n    and the needy\
      \ for a pair of sandals.\n"
    7: "⁷ They trample on the heads of the poor\n    as on the dust of the ground\n\
      \    and deny justice to the oppressed.\nFather and son use the same girl\n\
      \    and so profane my holy name.\n"
    8: "⁸ They lie down beside every altar\n    on garments taken in pledge.\nIn the\
      \ house of their god\n    they drink wine taken as fines. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them,\n    though they were tall as\
      \ the cedars\n    and strong as the oaks.\nI destroyed their fruit above\n \
      \   and their roots below.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I brought you up out of Egypt\n    and led you forty years in the wilderness\n\
      \    to give you the land of the Amorites. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I also raised up prophets from among your children\n    and Nazirites\
      \ from among your youths.\nIs this not true, people of Israel?”\ndeclares the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “But you made the Nazirites drink wine\n    and commanded the prophets\
      \ not to prophesy. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Now then, I will crush you\n    as a cart crushes when loaded with grain.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The swift will not escape,\n    the strong will not muster their strength,\n\
      \    and the warrior will not save his life.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The archer will not stand his ground,\n    the fleet-footed soldier will\
      \ not get away,\n    and the horseman will not save his life.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Even the bravest warriors\n    will flee naked on that day,”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord."
  3:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the Lord has spoken against you—against\
      \ the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: \n"
    2: "² “You only have I chosen\n    of all the families of the earth;\ntherefore\
      \ I will punish you\n    for all your sins.” \n"
    3: "³ Do two walk together\n    unless they have agreed to do so?\n"
    4: "⁴ Does a lion roar in the thicket\n    when it has no prey?\nDoes it growl\
      \ in its den\n    when it has caught nothing?\n"
    5: "⁵ Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground\n    when no bait is there?\n\
      Does a trap spring up from the ground\n    if it has not caught anything?\n"
    6: "⁶ When a trumpet sounds in a city,\n    do not the people tremble?\nWhen disaster\
      \ comes to a city,\n    has not the Lord caused it? \n"
    7: "⁷ Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing\n    without revealing his plan\n\
      \    to his servants the prophets. \n"
    8: "⁸ The lion has roared—\n    who will not fear?\nThe Sovereign Lord has spoken—\n\
      \    who can but prophesy? \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod\n    and to the fortresses of Egypt:\n\
      “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria;\n    see the great unrest\
      \ within her\n    and the oppression among her people.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord,\n    “who store\
      \ up in their fortresses\n    what they have plundered and looted.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n“An enemy will overrun\
      \ your land,\n    pull down your strongholds\n    and plunder your fortresses.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth\n\
      \    only two leg bones or a piece of an ear,\nso will the Israelites living\
      \ in Samaria be rescued,\n    with only the head of a bed\n    and a piece of\
      \ fabric from a couch.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,” declares the\
      \ Lord, the Lord God Almighty. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “On the day I punish Israel for her sins,\n    I will destroy the altars\
      \ of Bethel;\nthe horns of the altar will be cut off\n    and fall to the ground.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will tear down the winter house\n    along with the summer house;\n\
      the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed\n    and the mansions will be\
      \ demolished,”\ndeclares the Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria,\n    you women who\
      \ oppress the poor and crush the needy\n    and say to your husbands, “Bring\
      \ us some drinks!”\n"
    2: "² The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness:\n    “The time will surely\
      \ come\nwhen you will be taken away with hooks,\n    the last of you with fishhooks.\n"
    3: "³ You will each go straight out\n    through breaches in the wall,\n    and\
      \ you will be cast out toward Harmon,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ “Go to Bethel and sin;\n    go to Gilgal and sin yet more.\nBring your sacrifices\
      \ every morning,\n    your tithes every three years.\n"
    5: "⁵ Burn leavened bread as a thank offering\n    and brag about your freewill\
      \ offerings—\nboast about them, you Israelites,\n    for this is what you love\
      \ to do,”\ndeclares the Sovereign Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I gave you empty stomachs in every city\n    and lack of bread in every\
      \ town,\n    yet you have not returned to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ “I also withheld rain from you\n    when the harvest was still three months\
      \ away.\nI sent rain on one town,\n    but withheld it from another.\nOne field\
      \ had rain;\n    another had none and dried up.\n"
    8: "⁸ People staggered from town to town for water\n    but did not get enough\
      \ to drink,\n    yet you have not returned to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards,\n    destroying them with\
      \ blight and mildew.\nLocusts devoured your fig and olive trees,\n    yet you\
      \ have not returned to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “I sent plagues among you\n    as I did to Egypt.\nI killed your young\
      \ men with the sword,\n    along with your captured horses.\nI filled your nostrils\
      \ with the stench of your camps,\n    yet you have not returned to me,”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I overthrew some of you\n    as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\nYou\
      \ were like a burning stick snatched from the fire,\n    yet you have not returned\
      \ to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel,\n    and because I will\
      \ do this to you, Israel,\n    prepare to meet your God.” \n"
    13: "¹³ He who forms the mountains,\n    who creates the wind,\n    and who reveals\
      \ his thoughts to mankind,\nwho turns dawn to darkness,\n    and treads on the\
      \ heights of the earth—\n    the Lord God Almighty is his name."
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: \n"
    2: "² “Fallen is Virgin Israel,\n    never to rise again,\ndeserted in her own\
      \ land,\n    with no one to lift her up.” \n"
    3: "³ This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel:\n“Your city that marches\
      \ out a thousand strong\n    will have only a hundred left;\nyour town that\
      \ marches out a hundred strong\n    will have only ten left.” \n"
    4: "⁴ This is what the Lord says to Israel:\n“Seek me and live;\n"
    5: "⁵     do not seek Bethel,\ndo not go to Gilgal,\n    do not journey to Beersheba.\n\
      For Gilgal will surely go into exile,\n    and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.”\n"
    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord and live,\n    or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph\
      \ like a fire;\nit will devour them,\n    and Bethel will have no one to quench\
      \ it. \n"
    7: "⁷ There are those who turn justice into bitterness\n    and cast righteousness\
      \ to the ground. \n"
    8: "⁸ He who made the Pleiades and Orion,\n    who turns midnight into dawn\n\
      \    and darkens day into night,\nwho calls for the waters of the sea\n    and\
      \ pours them out over the face of the land—\n    the Lord is his name.\n"
    9: "⁹ With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold\n    and brings the fortified\
      \ city to ruin. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court\n    and\
      \ detest the one who tells the truth. \n"
    11: "¹¹ You levy a straw tax on the poor\n    and impose a tax on their grain.\n\
      Therefore, though you have built stone mansions,\n    you will not live in them;\n\
      though you have planted lush vineyards,\n    you will not drink their wine.\n"
    12: "¹² For I know how many are your offenses\n    and how great your sins.\n\
      There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes\n    and deprive the\
      \ poor of justice in the courts.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times,\n    for the times are\
      \ evil. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seek good, not evil,\n    that you may live.\nThen the Lord God Almighty\
      \ will be with you,\n    just as you say he is.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hate evil, love good;\n    maintain justice in the courts.\nPerhaps the\
      \ Lord God Almighty will have mercy\n    on the remnant of Joseph. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says:\n“There\
      \ will be wailing in all the streets\n    and cries of anguish in every public\
      \ square.\nThe farmers will be summoned to weep\n    and the mourners to wail.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There will be wailing in all the vineyards,\n    for I will pass through\
      \ your midst,”\nsays the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to you who long\n    for the day of the Lord!\nWhy do you long for\
      \ the day of the Lord?\n    That day will be darkness, not light.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ It will be as though a man fled from a lion\n    only to meet a bear,\n\
      as though he entered his house\n    and rested his hand on the wall\n    only\
      \ to have a snake bite him.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light—\n    pitch-dark,\
      \ without a ray of brightness? \n"
    21: "²¹ “I hate, I despise your religious festivals;\n    your assemblies are\
      \ a stench to me.\n"
    22: "²² Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings,\n    I will\
      \ not accept them.\nThough you bring choice fellowship offerings,\n    I will\
      \ have no regard for them.\n"
    23: "²³ Away with the noise of your songs!\n    I will not listen to the music\
      \ of your harps.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But let justice roll on like a river,\n    righteousness like a never-failing\
      \ stream! \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings\n    forty years in the wilderness,\
      \ people of Israel?\n"
    26: "²⁶ You have lifted up the shrine of your king,\n    the pedestal of your\
      \ idols,\n    the star of your god—\n    which you made for yourselves.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”\n    says the Lord,\
      \ whose name is God Almighty."
  6:
    1: "¹ Woe to you who are complacent in Zion,\n    and to you who feel secure on\
      \ Mount Samaria,\nyou notable men of the foremost nation,\n    to whom the people\
      \ of Israel come!\n"
    2: "² Go to Kalneh and look at it;\n    go from there to great Hamath,\n    and\
      \ then go down to Gath in Philistia.\nAre they better off than your two kingdoms?\n\
      \    Is their land larger than yours?\n"
    3: "³ You put off the day of disaster\n    and bring near a reign of terror.\n"
    4: "⁴ You lie on beds adorned with ivory\n    and lounge on your couches.\nYou\
      \ dine on choice lambs\n    and fattened calves.\n"
    5: "⁵ You strum away on your harps like David\n    and improvise on musical instruments.\n"
    6: "⁶ You drink wine by the bowlful\n    and use the finest lotions,\n    but\
      \ you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;\n    your feasting\
      \ and lounging will end. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares:\n\
      “I abhor the pride of Jacob\n    and detest his fortresses;\nI will deliver\
      \ up the city\n    and everything in it.” \n"
    9: '⁹ If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. '
    10: "¹⁰ And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to\
      \ burn them asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?”\
      \ and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the\
      \ name of the Lord.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has given the command,\n    and he will smash the great house\
      \ into pieces\n    and the small house into bits. \n"
    12: "¹² Do horses run on the rocky crags?\n    Does one plow the sea with oxen?\n\
      But you have turned justice into poison\n    and the fruit of righteousness\
      \ into bitterness—\n"
    13: "¹³ you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar\n    and say, “Did we not\
      \ take Karnaim by our own strength?” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the Lord God Almighty declares,\n    “I will stir up a nation against\
      \ you, Israel,\nthat will oppress you all the way\n    from Lebo Hamath to the\
      \ valley of the Arabah.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts
      after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming
      up. '
    2: "² When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, forgive!\
      \ How can Jacob survive? He is so small!” \n"
    3: "³ So the Lord relented.\n“This will not happen,” the Lord said. \n"
    4: '⁴ This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: The Sovereign Lord was calling
      for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. '
    5: "⁵ Then I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive?\
      \ He is so small!” \n"
    6: "⁶ So the Lord relented.\n“This will not happen either,” the Sovereign Lord\
      \ said. \n"
    7: '⁷ This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been
      built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Amos?”\n“A plumb line,” I replied.\n\
      Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel;\
      \ I will spare them no longer. \n"
    9: "⁹ “The high places of Isaac will be destroyed\n    and the sanctuaries of\
      \ Israel will be ruined;\n    with my sword I will rise against the house of\
      \ Jeroboam.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel:
      “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land
      cannot bear all his words. '
    11: "¹¹ For this is what Amos is saying:\n“‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,\n\
      \    and Israel will surely go into exile,\n    away from their native land.’”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of
      Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. '
    13: "¹³ Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary\
      \ and the temple of the kingdom.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet,
      but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the Lord took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy
      to my people Israel.’ '
    16: "¹⁶ Now then, hear the word of the Lord. You say,\n“‘Do not prophesy against\
      \ Israel,\n    and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n“‘Your wife will become a prostitute\
      \ in the city,\n    and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword.\nYour\
      \ land will be measured and divided up,\n    and you yourself will die in a\
      \ pagan country.\nAnd Israel will surely go into exile,\n    away from their\
      \ native land.’”"
  8:
    1: '¹ This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: a basket of ripe fruit. '
    2: "² “What do you see, Amos?” he asked.\n“A basket of ripe fruit,” I answered.\n\
      Then the Lord said to me, “The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare\
      \ them no longer. \n"
    3: "³ “In that day,” declares the Sovereign Lord, “the songs in the temple will\
      \ turn to wailing. Many, many bodies—flung everywhere! Silence!” \n"
    4: "⁴ Hear this, you who trample the needy\n    and do away with the poor of the\
      \ land, \n"
    5: "⁵ saying,\n“When will the New Moon be over\n    that we may sell grain,\n\
      and the Sabbath be ended\n    that we may market wheat?”—\nskimping on the measure,\n\
      \    boosting the price\n    and cheating with dishonest scales,\n"
    6: "⁶ buying the poor with silver\n    and the needy for a pair of sandals,\n\
      \    selling even the sweepings with the wheat. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: “I will never forget\
      \ anything they have done. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Will not the land tremble for this,\n    and all who live in it mourn?\n\
      The whole land will rise like the Nile;\n    it will be stirred up and then\
      \ sink\n    like the river of Egypt. \n"
    9: "⁹ “In that day,” declares the Sovereign Lord,\n“I will make the sun go down\
      \ at noon\n    and darken the earth in broad daylight.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will turn your religious festivals into mourning\n    and all your singing\
      \ into weeping.\nI will make all of you wear sackcloth\n    and shave your heads.\n\
      I will make that time like mourning for an only son\n    and the end of it like\
      \ a bitter day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “The days are coming,” declares the Sovereign Lord,\n    “when I will\
      \ send a famine through the land—\nnot a famine of food or a thirst for water,\n\
      \    but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² People will stagger from sea to sea\n    and wander from north to east,\n\
      searching for the word of the Lord,\n    but they will not find it. \n"
    13: "¹³ “In that day\n“the lovely young women and strong young men\n    will faint\
      \ because of thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Those who swear by the sin of Samaria—\n    who say, ‘As surely as your\
      \ god lives, Dan,’\n    or, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives’—\n   \
      \ they will fall, never to rise again.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:\n“Strike the tops of\
      \ the pillars\n    so that the thresholds shake.\nBring them down on the heads\
      \ of all the people;\n    those who are left I will kill with the sword.\nNot\
      \ one will get away,\n    none will escape.\n"
    2: "² Though they dig down to the depths below,\n    from there my hand will take\
      \ them.\nThough they climb up to the heavens above,\n    from there I will bring\
      \ them down.\n"
    3: "³ Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,\n    there I will hunt\
      \ them down and seize them.\nThough they hide from my eyes at the bottom of\
      \ the sea,\n    there I will command the serpent to bite them.\n"
    4: "⁴ Though they are driven into exile by their enemies,\n    there I will command\
      \ the sword to slay them.\n“I will keep my eye on them\n    for harm and not\
      \ for good.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord, the Lord Almighty—\nhe touches the earth and it melts,\n    and\
      \ all who live in it mourn;\nthe whole land rises like the Nile,\n    then sinks\
      \ like the river of Egypt;\n"
    6: "⁶ he builds his lofty palace in the heavens\n    and sets its foundation on\
      \ the earth;\nhe calls for the waters of the sea\n    and pours them out over\
      \ the face of the land—\n    the Lord is his name. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Are not you Israelites\n    the same to me as the Cushites?”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord.\n“Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt,\n    the Philistines from\
      \ Caphtor\n    and the Arameans from Kir? \n"
    8: "⁸ “Surely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord\n    are on the sinful kingdom.\n\
      I will destroy it\n    from the face of the earth.\nYet I will not totally destroy\n\
      \    the descendants of Jacob,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    9: "⁹ “For I will give the command,\n    and I will shake the people of Israel\n\
      \    among all the nations\nas grain is shaken in a sieve,\n    and not a pebble\
      \ will reach the ground.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ All the sinners among my people\n    will die by the sword,\nall those\
      \ who say,\n    ‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “In that day\n“I will restore David’s fallen shelter—\n    I will repair\
      \ its broken walls\n    and restore its ruins—\n    and will rebuild it as it\
      \ used to be,\n"
    12: "¹² so that they may possess the remnant of Edom\n    and all the nations\
      \ that bear my name,”\ndeclares the Lord, who will do these things. \n"
    13: "¹³ “The days are coming,” declares the Lord,\n“when the reaper will be overtaken\
      \ by the plowman\n    and the planter by the one treading grapes.\nNew wine\
      \ will drip from the mountains\n    and flow from all the hills,\n"
    14: "¹⁴     and I will bring my people Israel back from exile.\n“They will rebuild\
      \ the ruined cities and live in them.\n    They will plant vineyards and drink\
      \ their wine;\n    they will make gardens and eat their fruit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will plant Israel in their own land,\n    never again to be uprooted\n\
      \    from the land I have given them,”\nsays the Lord your God."
