Exodus:
  1:
    1: "¹ Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;\
      \ every man and his household came with Jacob. \n"
    2: "² Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, \n"
    3: "³ Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, \n"
    4: "⁴ Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. \n"
    5: "⁵ And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls:\
      \ for Joseph was in Egypt already. \n"
    6: "⁶ And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and\
      \ multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. \n"
    9: "⁹ And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel\
      \ are more and mightier than we: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come\
      \ to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies,\
      \ and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their\
      \ burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. \n"
    12: "¹² But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And\
      \ they were grieved because of the children of Israel. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in\
      \ brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein\
      \ they made them serve, was with rigour. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name\
      \ of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and\
      \ see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it\
      \ be a daughter, then she shall live. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded\
      \ them, but saved the men children alive. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why\
      \ have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as\
      \ the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives\
      \ come in unto them. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied,\
      \ and waxed very mighty. \n"
    21: "²¹ And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them\
      \ houses. \n"
    22: ²² And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall
      cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
  2:
    1: "¹ And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of\
      \ Levi. \n"
    2: "² And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was\
      \ a goodly child, she hid him three months. \n"
    3: "³ And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes,\
      \ and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she\
      \ laid it in the flags by the river's brink. \n"
    4: "⁴ And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. \n"
    5: "⁵ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and\
      \ her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among\
      \ the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. \n"
    6: "⁶ And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept.\
      \ And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee\
      \ a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? \n"
    8: "⁸ And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the\
      \ child's mother. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it\
      \ for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and\
      \ nursed it. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he\
      \ became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew\
      \ him out of the water. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went\
      \ out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian\
      \ smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. \n"
    12: "¹² And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no\
      \ man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. \n"
    13: "¹³ And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove\
      \ together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy\
      \ fellow? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou\
      \ to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely\
      \ this thing is known. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses\
      \ fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat\
      \ down by a well. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water,\
      \ and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped\
      \ them, and watered their flock. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are\
      \ come so soon to day? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,\
      \ and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have\
      \ left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. \n"
    21: "²¹ And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah\
      \ his daughter. \n"
    22: "²² And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I\
      \ have been a stranger in a strange land. \n"
    23: "²³ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and\
      \ the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and\
      \ their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham,\
      \ with Isaac, and with Jacob. \n"
    25: ²⁵ And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
  3:
    1: "¹ Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian:\
      \ and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain\
      \ of God, even to Horeb. \n"
    2: "² And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the\
      \ midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and\
      \ the bush was not consumed. \n"
    3: "³ And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the\
      \ bush is not burnt. \n"
    4: "⁴ And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out\
      \ of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet,\
      \ for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. \n"
    6: "⁶ Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God\
      \ of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid\
      \ to look upon God. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which\
      \ are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for\
      \ I know their sorrows; \n"
    8: "⁸ And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and\
      \ to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land\
      \ flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites,\
      \ and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me:\
      \ and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest\
      \ bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and\
      \ that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? \n"
    12: "¹² And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token\
      \ unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people\
      \ out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. \n"
    13: "¹³ And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel,\
      \ and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and\
      \ they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou\
      \ say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children\
      \ of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,\
      \ and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and\
      \ this is my memorial unto all generations. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord\
      \ God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared\
      \ unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to\
      \ you in Egypt: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto\
      \ the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,\
      \ and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the\
      \ elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord\
      \ God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three\
      \ days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a\
      \ mighty hand. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which\
      \ I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. \n"
    21: "²¹ And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and\
      \ it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty. \n"
    22: '²² But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth
      in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall
      put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.'
  4:
    1: "¹ And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor\
      \ hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto\
      \ thee. \n"
    2: "² And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it\
      \ became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. \n"
    4: "⁴ And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail.\
      \ And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham,\
      \ the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom.\
      \ And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand\
      \ was leprous as snow. \n"
    7: "⁷ And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into\
      \ his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned\
      \ again as his other flesh. \n"
    8: "⁸ And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken\
      \ to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter\
      \ sign. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs,\
      \ neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river,\
      \ and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the\
      \ river shall become blood upon the dry land. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore,\
      \ nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and\
      \ of a slow tongue. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the\
      \ dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord? \n"
    12: "¹² Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou\
      \ shalt say. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou\
      \ wilt send. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not\
      \ Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold,\
      \ he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his\
      \ heart. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will\
      \ be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he\
      \ shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto\
      \ him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt,\
      \ and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all\
      \ the men are dead which sought thy life. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he\
      \ returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see\
      \ that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand:\
      \ but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. \n"
    22: "²² And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son,\
      \ even my firstborn: \n"
    23: "²³ And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou\
      \ refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and\
      \ sought to kill him. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son,\
      \ and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of\
      \ the circumcision. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And\
      \ he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all\
      \ the signs which he had commanded him. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children\
      \ of Israel: \n"
    30: "³⁰ And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and\
      \ did the signs in the sight of the people. \n"
    31: '³¹ And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited
      the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they
      bowed their heads and worshipped.'
  5:
    1: "¹ And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the\
      \ Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in\
      \ the wilderness. \n"
    2: "² And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel\
      \ go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. \n"
    3: "³ And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray\
      \ thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our\
      \ God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. \n"
    4: "⁴ And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron,\
      \ let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. \n"
    5: "⁵ And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make\
      \ them rest from their burdens. \n"
    6: "⁶ And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their\
      \ officers, saying, \n"
    7: "⁷ Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let\
      \ them go and gather straw for themselves. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay\
      \ upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore\
      \ they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. \n"
    9: "⁹ Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein;\
      \ and let them not regard vain words. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they\
      \ spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work\
      \ shall be diminished. \n"
    12: "¹² So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to\
      \ gather stubble instead of straw. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily\
      \ tasks, as when there was straw. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters\
      \ had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled\
      \ your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh,\
      \ saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick:\
      \ and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and\
      \ do sacrifice to the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet\
      \ shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil\
      \ case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your\
      \ daily task. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth\
      \ from Pharaoh: \n"
    21: "²¹ And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because ye\
      \ have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\
      \ of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. \n"
    22: "²² And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou\
      \ so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? \n"
    23: ²³ For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to
      this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
  6:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh:\
      \ for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall\
      \ he drive them out of his land. \n"
    2: "² And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: \n"
    3: "³ And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of\
      \ God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them. \n"
    4: "⁴ And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land\
      \ of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. \n"
    5: "⁵ And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians\
      \ keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring\
      \ you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of\
      \ their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great\
      \ judgments: \n"
    7: "⁷ And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and\
      \ ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under\
      \ the burdens of the Egyptians. \n"
    8: "⁸ And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear\
      \ to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for\
      \ an heritage: I am the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto\
      \ Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \n"
    11: "¹¹ Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel\
      \ go out of his land. \n"
    12: "¹² And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel\
      \ have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised\
      \ lips? \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto\

    9: "⁹ And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee,\

    10: "¹⁰ And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that\

    11: "¹¹ And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy\

    12: "¹² And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the Lord\

    13: "¹³ And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out\

    14: "¹⁴ And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and\
      \ hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and\
      \ smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land\
      \ of Egypt. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote\
      \ the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust\
      \ of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice,\
      \ but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's\
      \ heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand\

      \ the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me. \n"
    21: "²¹ Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of\

    23: "²³ And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow\
      \ shall this sign be. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the\
      \ house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of\
      \ Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice\
      \ to your God in the land. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination\
      \ of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination\

    27: "²⁷ We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the\
      \ Lord our God, as he shall command us. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Lord\
      \ your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for\
      \ me. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the Lord\
      \ that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from\
      \ his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not\
      \ letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. \n"
    31: "³¹ And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms\
      \ of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained\
      \ not one. \n"
    32: ³² And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let
      the people go.
  9:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith\
      \ the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. \n"
    2: "² For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, \n"
    3: "³ Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon\
      \ the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep:\
      \ there shall be a very grievous murrain. \n"
    4: "⁴ And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of\
      \ Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this\
      \ thing in the land. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died:\
      \ but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. \n"
    7: "⁷ And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites\
      \ dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people\
      \ go. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes\
      \ of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of\
      \ Pharaoh. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a\
      \ boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the\
      \ land of Egypt. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses\
      \ sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains\
      \ upon man, and upon beast. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for\
      \ the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto\
      \ them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand\
      \ before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews,\
      \ Let my people go, that they may serve me. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon\
      \ thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none\
      \ like me in all the earth. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people\
      \ with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in\
      \ thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let\
      \ them go? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous\
      \ hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until\
      \ now. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the\
      \ field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and\
      \ shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall\
      \ die. \n"
    20: "²⁰ He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made\
      \ his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: \n"
    21: "²¹ And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his\
      \ cattle in the field. \n"
    22: "²² And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,\
      \ that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast,\
      \ and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. \n"
    23: "²³ And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent thunder\
      \ and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail\
      \ upon the land of Egypt. \n"
    24: "²⁴ So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such\
      \ as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the\
      \ field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and\
      \ brake every tree of the field. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there\
      \ no hail. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them,\
      \ I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings\
      \ and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will\
      \ spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease, neither\
      \ shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is\

    30: "³⁰ But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    31: "³¹ And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear,\
      \ and the flax was bolled. \n"
    32: "³² But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.\
      \ \n"
    33: "³³ And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands\
      \ unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured\
      \ upon the earth. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were\
      \ ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. \n"
    35: ³⁵ And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children
      of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
  10:
    1: "¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his\
      \ heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before\
      \ him: \n"
    2: "² And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son,\
      \ what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among\
      \ them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith\
      \ the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before\
      \ me? let my people go, that they may serve me. \n"
    4: "⁴ Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring\
      \ the locusts into thy coast: \n"
    5: "⁵ And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see\
      \ the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which\
      \ remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for\
      \ you out of the field: \n"
    6: "⁶ And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and\
      \ the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers'\
      \ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.\
      \ And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. \n"
    7: "⁷ And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare\
      \ unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou\
      \ not yet that Egypt is destroyed? \n"
    8: "⁸ And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them,\
      \ Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go? \n"
    9: "⁹ And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons\
      \ and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for\
      \ we must hold a feast unto the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you\
      \ go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did desire.\
      \ And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of\
      \ Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat\
      \ every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. \n"
    13: "¹³ And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord\
      \ brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when\
      \ it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the\
      \ coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts\
      \ as they, neither after them shall be such. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened;\
      \ and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which\
      \ the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or\
      \ in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have\
      \ sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat\
      \ the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts,\
      \ and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts\
      \ of Egypt. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children\
      \ of Israel go. \n"
    21: "²¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that\
      \ there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick\

    23: "²³ They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days:\
      \ but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only let\
      \ your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings,\
      \ that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind;\
      \ for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know not with what\
      \ we must serve the Lord, until we come thither. \n"
    27: "²⁷ But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see\
      \ my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. \n"
    29: ²⁹ And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
  11:
    1: "¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh,\
      \ and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you\
      \ go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. \n"
    2: "² Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour,\
      \ and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold. \n"
    3: "³ And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover\
      \ the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's\
      \ servants, and in the sight of the people. \n"
    4: "⁴ And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the\
      \ midst of Egypt: \n"
    5: "⁵ And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born\
      \ of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant\
      \ that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. \n"
    6: "⁶ And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as\
      \ there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. \n"
    7: "⁷ But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue,\
      \ against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference\
      \ between the Egyptians and Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves\
      \ unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after\
      \ that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my\
      \ wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord\
      \ hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel\
      \ go out of his land."
  12:
    1: "¹ And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, \n"
    2: "² This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first\
      \ month of the year to you. \n"
    3: "³ Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of\
      \ this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house\
      \ of their fathers, a lamb for an house: \n"
    4: "⁴ And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour\
      \ next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man\
      \ according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. \n"
    5: "⁵ Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take\
      \ it out from the sheep, or from the goats: \n"
    6: "⁶ And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and\
      \ the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and\
      \ on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. \n"
    8: "⁸ And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened\
      \ bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. \n"
    9: "⁹ Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his\
      \ head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which\
      \ remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet,\
      \ and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's\
      \ passover. \n"
    12: "¹² For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all\
      \ the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the\
      \ gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are:\
      \ and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be\
      \ upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a\
      \ feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by\
      \ an ordinance for ever. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall\
      \ put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from\
      \ the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh\
      \ day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be\
      \ done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of\
      \ you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame\
      \ day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye\
      \ observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall\
      \ eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever\
      \ eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation\
      \ of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened\
      \ bread. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw\
      \ out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in\
      \ the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that\
      \ is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until\
      \ the morning. \n"
    23: "²³ For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth\
      \ the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over\
      \ the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to\
      \ smite you. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons\
      \ for ever. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord\
      \ will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What\
      \ mean ye by this service? \n"
    27: "²⁷ That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed\
      \ over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians,\
      \ and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded\
      \ Moses and Aaron, so did they. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn\
      \ in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne\
      \ unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn\
      \ of cattle. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the\
      \ Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where\
      \ there was not one dead. \n"
    31: "³¹ And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get\
      \ you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go,\
      \ serve the Lord, as ye have said. \n"
    32: "³² Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and\
      \ bless me also. \n"
    33: "³³ And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them\
      \ out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs\
      \ being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they\
      \ borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so\
      \ that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the\
      \ Egyptians. \n"
    37: "³⁷ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six\
      \ hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. \n"
    38: "³⁸ And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even\
      \ very much cattle. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth\
      \ out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt,\
      \ and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.\
      \ \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was\
      \ four hundred and thirty years. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even\
      \ the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out\
      \ from the land of Egypt. \n"
    42: "⁴² It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out\
      \ from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all\
      \ the children of Israel in their generations. \n"
    43: "⁴³ And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover:\
      \ There shall no stranger eat thereof: \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised\
      \ him, then shall he eat thereof. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the\
      \ flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover\
      \ to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near\
      \ and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised\
      \ person shall eat thereof. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth\
      \ among you. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron,\
      \ so did they. \n"
    51: ⁵¹ And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children
      of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
  13:
    1: "¹ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \n"
    2: "² Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the\
      \ children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. \n"
    3: "³ And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out\
      \ from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord\
      \ brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. \n"
    4: "⁴ This day came ye out in the month Abib. \n"
    5: "⁵ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,\
      \ and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which\
      \ he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey,\
      \ that thou shalt keep this service in this month. \n"
    6: "⁶ Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall\
      \ be a feast to the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened\
      \ bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all\
      \ thy quarters. \n"
    8: "⁸ And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of\
      \ that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial\
      \ between thine eyes, that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong\
      \ hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,\
      \ as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, \n"
    12: "¹² That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and\
      \ every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be\
      \ the Lord's. \n"
    13: "¹³ And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou\
      \ wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn\
      \ of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What\
      \ is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord brought\
      \ us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord\
      \ slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and\
      \ the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth\
      \ the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between\
      \ thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led\
      \ them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was\
      \ near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war,\
      \ and they return to Egypt: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the\
      \ Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn\
      \ the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry\
      \ up my bones away hence with you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the\
      \ edge of the wilderness. \n"
    21: "²¹ And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them\
      \ the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day\
      \ and night: \n"
    22: ²² He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire
      by night, from before the people.
  14:
    1: "¹ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \n"
    2: "² Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,\
      \ between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp\
      \ by the sea. \n"
    3: "³ For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the\
      \ land, the wilderness hath shut them in. \n"
    4: "⁴ And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and\
      \ I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians\
      \ may know that I am the Lord. And they did so. \n"
    5: "⁵ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of\
      \ Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said,\
      \ Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? \n"
    6: "⁶ And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: \n"
    7: "⁷ And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt,\
      \ and captains over every one of them. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued\
      \ after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an\
      \ high hand. \n"
    9: "⁹ But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh,\
      \ and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside\
      \ Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes,\
      \ and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid:\
      \ and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast\
      \ thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus\
      \ with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? \n"
    12: "¹² Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone,\
      \ that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the\
      \ Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. \n"
    13: "¹³ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the\
      \ salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians\
      \ whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto\
      \ the children of Israel, that they go forward: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and\
      \ divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst\
      \ of the sea. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall\
      \ follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host,\
      \ upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten me\
      \ honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and\
      \ went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face,\
      \ and stood behind them: \n"
    20: "²⁰ And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel;\
      \ and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these:\
      \ so that the one came not near the other all the night. \n"
    21: "²¹ And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the\
      \ sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry\
      \ land, and the waters were divided. \n"
    22: "²² And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry\
      \ ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their\
      \ left. \n"
    23: "²³ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the\
      \ sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the\
      \ host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled\
      \ the host of the Egyptians, \n"
    25: "²⁵ And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that\
      \ the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth\
      \ for them against the Egyptians. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that\
      \ the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon\
      \ their horsemen. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned\
      \ to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against\
      \ it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and\
      \ all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained\
      \ not so much as one of them. \n"
    29: "²⁹ But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea;\
      \ and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;\
      \ and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. \n"
    31: '³¹ And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians:
      and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses.'
  15:
    1: "¹ Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and\
      \ spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously:\
      \ the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. \n"
    2: "² The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my\
      \ God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt\
      \ him. \n"
    3: "³ The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. \n"
    4: "⁴ Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains\
      \ also are drowned in the Red sea. \n"
    5: "⁵ The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord,\
      \ hath dashed in pieces the enemy. \n"
    7: "⁷ And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that\
      \ rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as\
      \ stubble. \n"
    8: "⁸ And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the\
      \ floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart\
      \ of the sea. \n"
    9: "⁹ The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;\
      \ my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall\
      \ destroy them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead\
      \ in the mighty waters. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious\
      \ in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? \n"
    12: "¹² Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. \n"
    13: "¹³ Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed:\
      \ thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants\
      \ of Palestina. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling\
      \ shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they\
      \ shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the\
      \ people pass over, which thou hast purchased. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,\
      \ in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary,\
      \ O Lord, which thy hands have established. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen\
      \ into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them;\
      \ but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her\
      \ hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously;\
      \ the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. \n"
    22: "²² So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness\
      \ of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. \n"
    23: "²³ And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah,\
      \ for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? \n"
    25: "²⁵ And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when\
      \ he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for\
      \ them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, \n"
    26: "²⁶ And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy\
      \ God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his\
      \ commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases\
      \ upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that\
      \ healeth thee. \n"
    27: '²⁷ And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore
      and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.'
  16:
    1: "¹ And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children\
      \ of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai,\
      \ on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the\
      \ land of Egypt. \n"
    2: "² And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses\
      \ and Aaron in the wilderness: \n"
    3: "³ And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the\
      \ hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and\
      \ when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\
      \ wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for\
      \ you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that\
      \ I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. \n"
    5: "⁵ And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that\
      \ which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. \n"
    6: "⁶ And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then\
      \ ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: \n"
    7: "⁷ And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for that he\
      \ heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are we, that ye murmur\
      \ against us? \n"
    8: "⁸ And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening\
      \ flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth\
      \ your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings\
      \ are not against us, but against the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children\
      \ of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the\
      \ children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the\
      \ glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \n"
    12: "¹² I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them,\
      \ saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled\
      \ with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God. \n"
    13: "¹³ And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the\
      \ camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness\
      \ there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is\
      \ manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the\
      \ bread which the Lord hath given you to eat. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man\
      \ according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of\
      \ your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing\
      \ over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according\
      \ to his eating. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of\
      \ it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with\
      \ them. \n"
    21: "²¹ And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating:\
      \ and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. \n"
    22: "²² And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much\
      \ bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came\
      \ and told Moses. \n"
    23: "²³ And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow\
      \ is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake\
      \ to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay\
      \ up for you to be kept until the morning. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink,\
      \ neither was there any worm therein. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord:\
      \ to day ye shall not find it in the field. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath,\
      \ in it there shall be none. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh\
      \ day for to gather, and they found none. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments\
      \ and my laws? \n"
    29: "²⁹ See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth\
      \ you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place,\
      \ let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. \n"
    30: "³⁰ So the people rested on the seventh day. \n"
    31: "³¹ And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like\
      \ coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.\
      \ \n"
    32: "³² And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer\
      \ of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith\
      \ I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of\
      \ Egypt. \n"
    33: "³³ And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein,\
      \ and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. \n"
    34: "³⁴ As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony,\
      \ to be kept. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came\
      \ to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders\
      \ of the land of Canaan. \n"
    36: ³⁶ Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
  17:
    1: "¹ And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness\
      \ of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and\
      \ pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. \n"
    2: "² Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that\
      \ we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do\
      \ ye tempt the Lord? \n"
    3: "³ And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against\
      \ Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt,\
      \ to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? \n"
    4: "⁴ And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people?\
      \ they be almost ready to stone me. \n"
    5: "⁵ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee\
      \ of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take\
      \ in thine hand, and go. \n"
    6: "⁶ Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou\
      \ shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people\
      \ may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. \n"
    7: "⁷ And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the\
      \ chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying,\
      \ Is the Lord among us, or not? \n"
    8: "⁸ Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek:\
      \ to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine\
      \ hand. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses,\
      \ Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed:\
      \ and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. \n"
    12: "¹² But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him,\
      \ and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the\
      \ one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until\
      \ the going down of the sun. \n"
    13: "¹³ And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and\
      \ rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance\
      \ of Amalek from under heaven. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: \n"
    16: ¹⁶ For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with
      Amalek from generation to generation.
  18:
    1: "¹ When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that\
      \ God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought\
      \ Israel out of Egypt; \n"
    2: "² Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he\
      \ had sent her back, \n"
    3: "³ And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said,\
      \ I have been an alien in a strange land: \n"
    4: "⁴ And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he,\
      \ was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: \n"
    5: "⁵ And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses\
      \ into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: \n"
    6: "⁶ And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and\
      \ thy wife, and her two sons with her. \n"
    7: "⁷ And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed\
      \ him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh\
      \ and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come\
      \ upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel,\
      \ whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the\
      \ hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered\
      \ the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein\
      \ they dealt proudly he was above them. \n"
    12: "¹² And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices\
      \ for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses'\
      \ father in law before God. \n"
    13: "¹³ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people:\
      \ and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said,\
      \ What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself\
      \ alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me\
      \ to enquire of God: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and\
      \ another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not\
      \ good. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee:\
      \ for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself\
      \ alone. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be\
      \ with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the\
      \ causes unto God: \n"
    20: "²⁰ And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the\
      \ way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. \n"
    21: "²¹ Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear\
      \ God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers\
      \ of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every\
      \ great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall\
      \ judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with\
      \ thee. \n"
    23: "²³ If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt\
      \ be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that\
      \ he had said. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the\
      \ people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers\
      \ of tens. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought\
      \ unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. \n"
    27: ²⁷ And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own
      land.
  19:
    1: "¹ In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the\
      \ land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. \n"
    2: "² For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai,\
      \ and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain,\
      \ saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of\
      \ Israel; \n"
    4: "⁴ Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles'\
      \ wings, and brought you unto myself. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then\
      \ ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth\
      \ is mine: \n"
    6: "⁶ And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These\
      \ are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. \n"
    7: "⁷ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before\
      \ their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him. \n"
    8: "⁸ And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken\
      \ we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that\
      \ the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And\
      \ Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to\
      \ day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, \n"
    11: "¹¹ And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come\
      \ down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. \n"
    12: "¹² And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed\
      \ to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it:\
      \ whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: \n"
    13: "¹³ There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot\
      \ through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth\
      \ long, they shall come up to the mount. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the\
      \ people; and they washed their clothes. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not\
      \ at your wives. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders\
      \ and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet\
      \ exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and\
      \ they stood at the nether part of the mount. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended\
      \ upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,\
      \ and the whole mount quaked greatly. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder,\
      \ Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and\
      \ the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. \n"
    21: "²¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break\
      \ through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish. \n"
    22: "²² And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify themselves,\
      \ lest the Lord break forth upon them. \n"
    23: "²³ And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai:\
      \ for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up,\
      \ thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through\
      \ to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them. \n"
    25: ²⁵ So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
  20:
    1: "¹ And God spake all these words, saying, \n"
    2: "² I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt,\
      \ out of the house of bondage. \n"
    3: "³ Thou shalt have no other gods before me. \n"
    4: "⁴ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing\
      \ that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the\
      \ water under the earth. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord\
      \ thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children\
      \ unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; \n"
    6: "⁶ And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will\
      \ not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. \n"
    8: "⁸ Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. \n"
    9: "⁹ Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt\
      \ not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor\
      \ thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that\
      \ in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath\
      \ day, and hallowed it. \n"
    12: "¹² Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land\
      \ which the Lord thy God giveth thee. \n"
    13: "¹³ Thou shalt not kill. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thou shalt not commit adultery. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thou shalt not steal. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's\

    18: "¹⁸ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise\
      \ of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they\
      \ removed, and stood afar off. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let\
      \ not God speak with us, lest we die. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you,\
      \ and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. \n"
    21: "²¹ And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness\
      \ where God was. \n"
    22: "²² And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of\
      \ Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. \n"
    23: "²³ Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you\
      \ gods of gold. \n"
    24: "²⁴ An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon\
      \ thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in\
      \ all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless\
      \ thee. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of\
      \ hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. \n"
    26: ²⁶ Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be
      not discovered thereon.
  21:
    1: "¹ Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. \n"
    2: "² If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh\
      \ he shall go out free for nothing. \n"
    3: "³ If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married,\
      \ then his wife shall go out with him. \n"
    4: "⁴ If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters;\
      \ the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my\
      \ children; I will not go out free: \n"
    6: "⁶ Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him\
      \ to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through\
      \ with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. \n"
    7: "⁷ And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out\
      \ as the menservants do. \n"
    8: "⁸ If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall\
      \ he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no\
      \ power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. \n"
    9: "⁹ And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after\
      \ the manner of daughters. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage,\
      \ shall he not diminish. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without\
      \ money. \n"
    12: "¹² He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. \n"
    13: "¹³ And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then\
      \ I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with\
      \ guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to\
      \ death. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his\
      \ hand, he shall surely be put to death. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to\
      \ death. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with\

    19: "¹⁹ If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote\
      \ him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him\
      \ to be thoroughly healed. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under\
      \ his hand; he shall be surely punished. \n"
    21: "²¹ Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished:\
      \ for he is his money. \n"
    22: "²² If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from\
      \ her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as\
      \ the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, \n"
    24: "²⁴ Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, \n"
    25: "²⁵ Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that\
      \ it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth;\
      \ he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. \n"
    28: "²⁸ If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely\
      \ stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be\
      \ quit. \n"
    29: "²⁹ But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath\
      \ been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath\
      \ killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall\
      \ be put to death. \n"
    30: "³⁰ If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom\
      \ of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. \n"
    31: "³¹ Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this\
      \ judgment shall it be done unto him. \n"
    32: "³² If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto\
      \ their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. \n"
    33: "³³ And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover\
      \ it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; \n"
    34: "³⁴ The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner\
      \ of them; and the dead beast shall be his. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell\
      \ the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.\
      \ \n"
    36: ³⁶ Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner
      hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his
      own.
  22:
    1: "¹ If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall\
      \ restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. \n"
    2: "² If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall\
      \ no blood be shed for him. \n"
    3: "³ If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he\

      \ his theft. \n"
    4: "⁴ If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or\
      \ ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. \n"
    5: "⁵ If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his\
      \ beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field,\

    6: "⁶ If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the\
      \ standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire\
      \ shall surely make restitution. \n"
    7: "⁷ If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it\
      \ be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought\
      \ unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's\
      \ goods. \n"
    9: "⁹ For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for\
      \ raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his,\
      \ the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges\

    10: "¹⁰ If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any\
      \ beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not\
      \ put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept\
      \ thereof, and he shall not make it good. \n"
    12: "¹² And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner\
      \ thereof. \n"
    13: "¹³ If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall\
      \ not make good that which was torn. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the\
      \ owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it\
      \ be an hired thing, it came for his hire. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he\
      \ shall surely endow her to be his wife. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money\
      \ according to the dowry of virgins. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. \n"
    20: "²⁰ He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be\
      \ utterly destroyed. \n"
    21: "²¹ Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers\
      \ in the land of Egypt. \n"
    22: "²² Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. \n"
    23: "²³ If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will\
      \ surely hear their cry; \n"
    24: "²⁴ And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your\
      \ wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. \n"
    25: "²⁵ If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt\
      \ not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. \n"
    26: "²⁶ If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver\
      \ it unto him by that the sun goeth down: \n"
    27: "²⁷ For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein\

      \ liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days\
      \ it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. \n"
    31: '³¹ And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that

  23:
    1: "¹ Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked\

    6: "⁶ Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. \n"
    7: "⁷ Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou\
      \ not: for I will not justify the wicked. \n"
    8: "⁸ And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth\
      \ the words of the righteous. \n"
    9: "⁹ Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger,\
      \ seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits\
      \ thereof: \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor\

      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened\

    13: "¹³ And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the\
      \ mount of God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again\
      \ unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters\
      \ to do, let him come unto them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. \n"

    21: "²¹ And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing\
      \ oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons,\
      \ and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and\
      \ his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. \n"
    22: "²² Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that\
      \ covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and\
      \ the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out\
      \ of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord: \n"
    24: "²⁴ And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his\
      \ sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar\
      \ for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the Lord: it is an offering\
      \ made by fire unto the Lord. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and\
      \ wave it for a wave offering before the Lord: and it shall be thy part. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder\
      \ of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram\
      \ of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is\
      \ for his sons: \n"
    28: "²⁸ And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children\
      \ of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering\
      \ from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even\
      \ their heave offering unto the Lord. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed\
      \ therein, and to be consecrated in them. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days,\
      \ when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the\
      \ holy place. \n"
    31: "³¹ And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh\
      \ in the holy place. \n"
    32: "³² And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that\
      \ is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n"
    33: "³³ And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate\
      \ and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are\
      \ holy. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain\
      \ unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not\

    35: "³⁵ And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things\
      \ which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. \n"
    36: "³⁶ And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement:\

    37: "³⁷ Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it;\

      \ holy. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the\
      \ first year day by day continually. \n"
    39: "³⁹ The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou\
      \ shalt offer at even: \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part\

    41: "⁴¹ And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according\

    42: "⁴² This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at\

    43: "⁴³ And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle\

      out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the Lord their God.'
  30:
    1: "¹ And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt\

    3: "³ And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides\

    12: "¹² And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \n"
    13: "¹³ Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths\

    14: "¹⁴ Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one\

    18: ¹⁸ And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon
      mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger

  32:
    1: "¹ And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount,\
      \ the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up,\

      \ \n"
    2: "² And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the\

      \ me. \n"
    3: "³ And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears,\
      \ and brought them unto Aaron. \n"
    4: "⁴ And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool,\
      \ after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel,\
      \ which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. \n"
    5: "⁵ And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation,\
      \ and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought\
      \ peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up\
      \ to play. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou\
      \ broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: \n"
    8: "⁸ They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they\
      \ have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed\
      \ thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee\
      \ up out of the land of Egypt. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is\
      \ a stiffnecked people: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and\
      \ that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth thy wrath\
      \ wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land\
      \ of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring\
      \ them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face\
      \ of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against\
      \ thy people. \n"
    13: "¹³ Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest\
      \ by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the\
      \ stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto\
      \ your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of\
      \ the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides;\
      \ on the one side and on the other were they written. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of\
      \ God, graven upon the tables. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said\
      \ unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither\
      \ is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them\
      \ that sing do I hear. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw\
      \ the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables\
      \ out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and\
      \ ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children\
      \ of Israel drink of it. \n"
    21: "²¹ And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast\
      \ brought so great a sin upon them? \n"
    22: "²² And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the\
      \ people, that they are set on mischief. \n"
    23: "²³ For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as\
      \ for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot\
      \ not what is become of him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off.\
      \ So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this\
      \ calf. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them\
      \ naked unto their shame among their enemies:) \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's\
      \ side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together\
      \ unto him. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man\
      \ his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the\
      \ camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every\
      \ man his neighbour. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there\
      \ fell of the people that day about three thousand men. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every\
      \ man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing\
      \ this day. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye\
      \ have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure\
      \ I shall make an atonement for your sin. \n"
    31: "³¹ And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned\
      \ a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. \n"
    32: "³² Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray\
      \ thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. \n"
    33: "³³ And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will\
      \ I blot out of my book. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken\
      \ unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day\
      \ when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. \n"
    35: ³⁵ And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron
      made.
  33:
    1: "¹ And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people\
      \ which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I\
      \ sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give\
      \ it: \n"
    2: "² And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite,\
      \ the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst\
      \ of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did\
      \ put on him his ornaments. \n"
    5: "⁵ For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are\
      \ a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and\
      \ consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know\
      \ what to do unto thee. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the\
      \ mount Horeb. \n"
    7: "⁷ And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off\
      \ from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came\
      \ to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle\
      \ of the congregation, which was without the camp. \n"
    8: "⁸ And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the\
      \ people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses,\
      \ until he was gone into the tabernacle. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar\
      \ descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with\
      \ Moses. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door:\
      \ and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his\
      \ friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son\
      \ of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. \n"
    12: "¹² And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this\
      \ people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou\
      \ hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.\

    26: "²⁶ And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof\
      \ round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round\
      \ about. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two\
      \ corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to\
      \ bear it withal. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. \n"
    29: ²⁹ And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices,
      according to the work of the apothecary.
  38:
    1: "¹ And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was\
      \ the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare;\

    3: "³ And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work\
      \ it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen,\
      \ with cunning work. \n"
    4: "⁴ They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges\
      \ was it coupled together. \n"
    5: "⁵ And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same,\
      \ according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and\
      \ fine twined linen; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    6: "⁶ And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets\
      \ are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. \n"
    7: "⁷ And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones\
      \ for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    8: "⁸ And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod;\
      \ of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. \n"
    9: "⁹ It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length\

    13: "¹³ And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed\
      \ in ouches of gold in their inclosings. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel,\
      \ twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one\
      \ with his name, according to the twelve tribes. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work\
      \ of pure gold. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two\
      \ rings in the two ends of the breastplate. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends\

    18: "¹⁸ And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches,\
      \ and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate,\

    20: "²⁰ And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of\
      \ the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling\
      \ thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. \n"
    21: "²¹ And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod\
      \ with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod,\
      \ and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the Lord commanded\
      \ Moses. \n"
    22: "²² And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. \n"
    23: "²³ And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon,\
      \ with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple,\
      \ and scarlet, and twined linen. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates\
      \ upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; \n"
    26: "²⁶ A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem\
      \ of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his\

    30: "³⁰ And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon\
      \ it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, Holiness To The Lord. \n"
    31: "³¹ And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre;\

    32: "³² Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation\
      \ finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded\
      \ Moses, so did they. \n"
    33: "³³ And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture,\

    3: "³ And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with\
      \ the vail. \n"
    4: "⁴ And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are\
      \ to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light\
      \ the lamps thereof. \n"
    5: "⁵ And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the\
      \ testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. \n"
    6: "⁶ And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the\
      \ tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. \n"
    7: "⁷ And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the\
      \ altar, and shalt put water therein. \n"
    8: "⁸ And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at\
      \ the court gate. \n"
    9: "⁹ And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all\
      \ that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it\
      \ shall be holy. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels,\
      \ and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. \n"
    12: "¹² And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle\
      \ of the congregation, and wash them with water. \n"
    13: "¹³ And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify\
      \ him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they\

    16: "¹⁶ Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first\
      \ day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set\
      \ up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering\

    25: "²⁵ And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the\
      \ vail: \n"
    27: "²⁷ And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. \n"

      \ the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the\
      \ meat offering; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar,\
      \ and put water there, to wash withal. \n"
    31: "³¹ And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:\
      \ \n"
    32: "³² When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near\
      \ unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    33: "³³ And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and\
      \ set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the\
      \ Lord filled the tabernacle. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because\
      \ the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children\

    37: "³⁷ But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day\
      \ that it was taken up. \n"
    38: ³⁸ For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was
      on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their
      journeys.
