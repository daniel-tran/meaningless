Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon\
      \ our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, \n"
    2: "² And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church\
      \ in thy house: \n"
    3: "³ Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, \n"
    5: "⁵ Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and\
      \ toward all saints; \n"
    6: "⁶ That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging\
      \ of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. \n"
    7: "⁷ For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of\
      \ the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. \n"
    8: "⁸ Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which\
      \ is convenient, \n"
    9: "⁹ Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the\
      \ aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee\
      \ and to me: \n"
    12: "¹² Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own\
      \ bowels: \n"
    13: "¹³ Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered\
      \ unto me in the bonds of the gospel: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be\
      \ as it were of necessity, but willingly. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive\
      \ him for ever; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially\
      \ to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do\
      \ not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou\
      \ wilt also do more than I say. \n"
    22: "²² But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers\
      \ I shall be given unto you. \n"
    23: "²³ There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; \n"
    24: "²⁴ Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
