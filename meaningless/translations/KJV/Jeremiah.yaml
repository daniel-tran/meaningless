Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth\
      \ in the land of Benjamin: \n"
    2: "² To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon\
      \ king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. \n"
    3: "³ It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto\
      \ the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah,\
      \ unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth\
      \ out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the\
      \ nations. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. \n"
    7: "⁷ But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all\
      \ that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. \n"
    8: "⁸ Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said\
      \ unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,\
      \ to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build,\
      \ and to plant. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest\
      \ thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. \n"
    12: "¹² Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my\
      \ word to perform it. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest\
      \ thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the\
      \ north. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth\
      \ upon all the inhabitants of the land. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith\
      \ the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at\
      \ the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof\
      \ round about, and against all the cities of Judah. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,\
      \ who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped\
      \ the works of their own hands. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that\
      \ I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before\
      \ them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar,\
      \ and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against\
      \ the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of\
      \ the land. \n"
    19: ¹⁹ And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee;
      for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.
  2:
    1: "¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n"
    2: "² Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; I remember\
      \ thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest\
      \ after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. \n"
    3: "³ Israel was holiness unto the Lord, and the firstfruits of his increase:\
      \ all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of\
      \ the house of Israel: \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they\
      \ are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain? \n"
    6: "⁶ Neither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land\
      \ of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and\
      \ of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a\
      \ land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt? \n"
    7: "⁷ And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and\
      \ the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine\
      \ heritage an abomination. \n"
    8: "⁸ The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew\
      \ me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied\
      \ by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. \n"
    9: "⁹ Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with your children's\
      \ children will I plead. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and\
      \ consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people\
      \ have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. \n"
    12: "¹² Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very\
      \ desolate, saith the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain\
      \ of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold\
      \ no water. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste:\
      \ his cities are burned without inhabitant. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the\
      \ Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters\
      \ of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters\
      \ of the river? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove\
      \ thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou\
      \ hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the\
      \ Lord God of hosts. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou\
      \ saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green\
      \ tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. \n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art\
      \ thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? \n"
    22: "²² For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine\
      \ iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God. \n"
    23: "²³ How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see\
      \ thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary\
      \ traversing her ways; \n"
    24: "²⁴ A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure;\
      \ in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary\
      \ themselves; in her month they shall find her. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou\
      \ saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will\
      \ I go. \n"
    26: "²⁶ As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed;\
      \ they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought\
      \ me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but\
      \ in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they\
      \ can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy\
      \ cities are thy gods, O Judah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me,\
      \ saith the Lord. \n"
    30: "³⁰ In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your\
      \ own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. \n"
    31: "³¹ O generation, see ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness unto\
      \ Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will\
      \ come no more unto thee? \n"
    32: "³² Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people\
      \ have forgotten me days without number. \n"
    33: "³³ Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught\
      \ the wicked ones thy ways. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents:\
      \ I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from\
      \ me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed\
      \ of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for
      the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.'
  3:
    1: "¹ They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another\
      \ man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?\
      \ but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me,\
      \ saith the Lord. \n"
    2: "² Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been\
      \ lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness;\
      \ and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter\
      \ rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. \n"
    4: "⁴ Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide\
      \ of my youth? \n"
    5: "⁵ Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold,\
      \ thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest. \n"
    6: "⁶ The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen\
      \ that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain\
      \ and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot. \n"
    7: "⁷ And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she\
      \ returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. \n"
    8: "⁸ And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed\
      \ adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous\
      \ sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled\
      \ the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto\
      \ me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself\
      \ more than treacherous Judah. \n"
    12: "¹² Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding\
      \ Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you:\
      \ for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever. \n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the\
      \ Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green\
      \ tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you:\
      \ and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you\
      \ to Zion: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed\
      \ you with knowledge and understanding. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the\
      \ land, in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more, The ark of the\
      \ covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember\
      \ it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all\
      \ the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem:\
      \ neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel,\
      \ and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that\
      \ I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant\
      \ land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call\
      \ me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye\
      \ dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the\
      \ children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten\
      \ the Lord their God. \n"
    22: "²² Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold,\
      \ we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. \n"
    23: "²³ Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude\
      \ of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their\
      \ flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. \n"
    25: '²⁵ We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned
      against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this
      day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.'
  4:
    1: "¹ If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me: and if thou\
      \ wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness;\
      \ and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your\
      \ fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. \n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart,\
      \ ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like\
      \ fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet\
      \ in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us\
      \ go into the defenced cities. \n"
    6: "⁶ Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil\
      \ from the north, and a great destruction. \n"
    7: "⁷ The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles\
      \ is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate;\
      \ and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. \n"
    8: "⁸ For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger\
      \ of the Lord is not turned back from us. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of\
      \ the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall\
      \ be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then said I, Ah, Lord God! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto\
      \ the soul. \n"
    11: "¹¹ At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind\
      \ of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not\
      \ to fan, nor to cleanse, \n"
    12: "¹² Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I\
      \ give sentence against them. \n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind:\
      \ his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved.\
      \ How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that\
      \ watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath\
      \ been rebellious against me, saith the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy\
      \ wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a\
      \ noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the\
      \ sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled:\
      \ suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. \n"
    21: "²¹ How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children,\
      \ and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good\
      \ they have no knowledge. \n"
    23: "²³ I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens,\
      \ and they had no light. \n"
    24: "²⁴ I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved\
      \ lightly. \n"
    25: "²⁵ I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens\
      \ were fled. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities\
      \ thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will\
      \ I not make a full end. \n"
    28: "²⁸ For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because\
      \ I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I\
      \ turn back from it. \n"
    29: "²⁹ The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they\
      \ shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken,\
      \ and not a man dwell therein. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself\
      \ with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou\
      \ rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy\
      \ lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life. \n"
    31: ³¹ For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of
      her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion,
      that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for
      my soul is wearied because of murderers.
  5:
    1: "¹ Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know,\
      \ and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any\
      \ that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. \n"
    2: "² And though they say, The Lord liveth; surely they swear falsely. \n"
    3: "³ O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but\
      \ they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive\
      \ correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused\
      \ to return. \n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know\
      \ not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God. \n"
    5: "⁵ I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have\
      \ known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether\
      \ broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings\
      \ shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that\
      \ goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are\
      \ many, and their backslidings are increased. \n"
    7: "⁷ How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn\
      \ by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed\
      \ adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. \n"
    8: "⁸ They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's\
      \ wife. \n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul\
      \ be avenged on such a nation as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away\
      \ her battlements; for they are not the Lord's. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously\
      \ against me, saith the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil\
      \ come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: \n"
    13: "¹³ And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus\
      \ shall it be done unto them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word,\
      \ behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and\
      \ it shall devour them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith\
      \ the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language\
      \ thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and\
      \ thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they\
      \ shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced\
      \ cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full end\

    4: "⁴ Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; Shall they fall,\

    7: "⁷ Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain:\

    8: "⁸ But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of\
      \ vanities. \n"
    9: "⁹ Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz,\
      \ the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple\

    10: "¹⁰ But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting\
      \ king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able\

    12: "¹² He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by\

    14: "¹⁴ Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by\
      \ the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath\
      \ in them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation\

    4: "⁴ Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out\
      \ of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do\
      \ them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and\

    5: "⁵ That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give\
      \ them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered\
      \ I, and said, So be it, O Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the Lord said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah,\

    7: "⁷ For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them\

      \ saying, Obey my voice. \n"
    8: "⁸ Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the\

      \ words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,\

    10: "¹⁰ They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused\
      \ to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house\

    11: "¹¹ Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which\

    12: "¹² Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry\

    13: "¹³ For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and\

    14: "¹⁴ Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer\

    15: "¹⁵ What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness\

    16: "¹⁶ The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit:\
      \ with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches\

    17: "¹⁷ For the Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against\

    18: "¹⁸ And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst\
      \ me their doings. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I\

    20: "²⁰ But, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins\

  12:
    1: "¹ Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with\

    2: "² Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they\

    3: "³ But thou, O Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward\

    4: "⁴ How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for\

      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt\

    7: "⁷ I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the\

    8: "⁸ Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against\

    14: "¹⁴ Thus saith the Lord against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance\
      \ which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them\

    3: "³ And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, \n"
    4: "⁴ Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise,\
      \ go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. \n"
    5: "⁵ So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. \n"
    6: "⁶ And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said unto me, Arise,\
      \ go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to\
      \ hide there. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place\
      \ where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable\
      \ for nothing. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus saith the Lord, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and\
      \ the great pride of Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination\
      \ of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them,\
      \ shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to\
      \ cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith\
      \ the Lord; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for\
      \ a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the Lord God\
      \ of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto\
      \ thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will fill\
      \ all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne,\
      \ and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with\
      \ drunkenness. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons\
      \ together, saith the Lord: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but\
      \ destroy them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the Lord hath spoken. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before\
      \ your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he\
      \ turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your\
      \ pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the\
      \ Lord's flock is carried away captive. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your\
      \ principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah\
      \ shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is\
      \ the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? \n"
    21: "²¹ What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them\
      \ to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a\
      \ woman in travail? \n"
    22: "²² And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For\
      \ the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made\
      \ bare. \n"
    23: "²³ Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may\
      \ ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the\
      \ wind of the wilderness. \n"
    25: "²⁵ This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the Lord;\
      \ because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may\
      \ appear. \n"
    27: ²⁷ I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom,
      and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem!
      wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?

    3: "³ And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to\
      \ the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they\
      \ were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. \n"
    4: "⁴ Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen\
      \ were ashamed, they covered their heads. \n"
    5: "⁵ Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was\
      \ no grass. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind\

    9: "⁹ Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save?\
      \ yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave\

    10: "¹⁰ Thus saith the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander,\
      \ they have not refrained their feet, therefore the Lord doth not accept them;\

    11: "¹¹ Then said the Lord unto me, Pray not for this people for their good. \n"
    12: "¹² When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering\
      \ and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword,\

    13: "¹³ Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall\

    14: "¹⁴ Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent\

    15: "¹⁵ Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in\
      \ my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be\

    16: "¹⁶ And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets\

    17: "¹⁷ Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with\

    4: "⁴ They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall\

    4: "⁴ For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of\

    5: "⁵ But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the Lord,\

    6: "⁶ For thus saith the Lord unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead\

      \ and cities which are not inhabited. \n"
    7: "⁷ And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons:\

    8: "⁸ And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to\
      \ his neighbour, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city? \n"
    9: "⁹ Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord\

    10: "¹⁰ Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that\

    15: "¹⁵ Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father\

      \ This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity:\

    23: "²³ O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious\

      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ As I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of\

  23:
    1: "¹ Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!\

      \ the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I\
      \ have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall\

    4: "⁴ And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall\

    7: "⁷ Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more\
      \ say, The Lord liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land\

    8: "⁸ But, The Lord liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house\

    9: "⁹ Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake;\

    10: "¹⁰ For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth;\

    11: "¹¹ For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found\

    12: "¹² Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness:\
      \ they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them,\

    13: "¹³ And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal,\
      \ and caused my people Israel to err. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they\
      \ commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers,\
      \ that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as\
      \ Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold,\
      \ I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for\
      \ from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets\
      \ that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own\
      \ heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall\
      \ have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination\

    18: "¹⁸ For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and\

    19: "¹⁹ Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous\

    21: "²¹ I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them,\

    22: "²² But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear\

    26: "²⁶ How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies?\

      \ they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name\
      \ for Baal. \n"
    28: "²⁸ The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath\

    29: "²⁹ Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that\

    31: "³¹ Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that use their tongues,\

    32: "³² Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord,\

      \ yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this\
      \ people at all, saith the Lord. \n"
    33: "³³ And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying,\
      \ What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden?\
      \ I will even forsake you, saith the Lord. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say,\
      \ The burden of the Lord, I will even punish that man and his house. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother,\

    36: "³⁶ And the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more: for every man's word\
      \ shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of\
      \ the Lord of hosts our God. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee?\
      \ and, What hath the Lord spoken? \n"
    38: "³⁸ But since ye say, The burden of the Lord; therefore thus saith the Lord;\
      \ Because ye say this word, The burden of the Lord, and I have sent unto you,\
      \ saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Lord; \n"
    39: "³⁹ Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake\
      \ you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my\

    40: ⁴⁰ And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame,

    1: "¹ The Lord shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the\

    8: "⁸ And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus\

    5: "⁵ To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you,\
      \ both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened; \n"
    6: "⁶ Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse\
      \ to all the nations of the earth. \n"
    7: "⁷ So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking\
      \ these words in the house of the Lord. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that\
      \ the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests\
      \ and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall\
      \ be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And\
      \ all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the\
      \ king's house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down in the entry of the\
      \ new gate of the Lord's house. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the\
      \ people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against\
      \ this city, as ye have heard with your ears. \n"
    12: "¹² Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying,\
      \ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all\
      \ the words that ye have heard. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the\
      \ Lord your God; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced\
      \ against you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet\
      \ unto you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring\
      \ innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants\
      \ thereof: for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these\
      \ words in your ears. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets;\
      \ This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the\
      \ Lord our God. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly\
      \ of the people, saying, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,\
      \ and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts;\
      \ Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the\
      \ mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did\
      \ he not fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord repented him of\
      \ the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great\
      \ evil against our souls. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah\
      \ the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and\
      \ against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. \n"
    21: "²¹ And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes,\
      \ heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard\
      \ it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; \n"
    22: "²² And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of\
      \ Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. \n"
    23: "²³ And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim\
      \ the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves\
      \ of the common people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that
      they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
  27:
    1: "¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah\
      \ came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, \n"
    2: "² Thus saith the Lord to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon\
      \ thy neck, \n"
    3: "³ And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king\
      \ of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the\
      \ hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hosts,\
      \ the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; \n"
    5: "⁵ I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by\
      \ my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it\
      \ seemed meet unto me. \n"
    6: "⁶ And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the\
      \ king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him\
      \ also to serve him. \n"
    7: "⁷ And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the\
      \ very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve\
      \ themselves of him. \n"
    8: "⁸ And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve\
      \ the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck\
      \ under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the\
      \ Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until\
      \ I have consumed them by his hand. \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to\
      \ your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak\
      \ unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and\
      \ that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,\
      \ and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the\
      \ Lord; and they shall till it, and dwell therein. \n"
    12: "¹² I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying,\
      \ Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and\
      \ his people, and live. \n"
    13: "¹³ Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and\
      \ by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not\
      \ serve the king of Babylon? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you,\
      \ saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto\
      \ you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesy a lie in my\
      \ name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets\
      \ that prophesy unto you. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith\
      \ the Lord; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you,\
      \ saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house shall now shortly be brought\
      \ again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore\
      \ should this city be laid waste? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let\
      \ them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are\
      \ left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and\
      \ at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning\
      \ the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels\
      \ that remain in this city. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive\
      \ Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and\
      \ all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; \n"
    21: "²¹ Yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels\
      \ that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah\
      \ and of Jerusalem; \n"
    22: ²² They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day
      that I visit them, saith the Lord; then will I bring them up, and restore them
      to this place.
  28:
    1: "¹ And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah\
      \ king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the\
      \ son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of\
      \ the Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, \n"
    2: "² Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken\
      \ the yoke of the king of Babylon. \n"
    3: "³ Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels\
      \ of the Lord's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this\
      \ place, and carried them to Babylon: \n"
    4: "⁴ And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king\
      \ of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the\
      \ Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence\
      \ of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house\
      \ of the Lord, \n"
    6: "⁶ Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the Lord do so: the Lord perform thy\
      \ words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the Lord's\
      \ house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in\
      \ the ears of all the people; \n"
    8: "⁸ The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied\
      \ both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil,\
      \ and of pestilence. \n"
    9: "⁹ The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall\
      \ come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent\
      \ him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's\
      \ neck, and brake it. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith\
      \ the Lord; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\
      \ from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet\
      \ Jeremiah went his way. \n"
    12: "¹² Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah\
      \ the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah,\
      \ saying, \n"
    13: "¹³ Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the\
      \ yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke\
      \ of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts\
      \ of the field also. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah;\
      \ The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face\
      \ of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion\
      \ against the Lord. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
  29:
    1: "¹ Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from\
      \ Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives,\
      \ and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; \n"
    2: "² (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes\
      \ of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed\
      \ from Jerusalem;) \n"
    3: "³ By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,\
      \ (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)\
      \ saying, \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried\
      \ away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit\
      \ of them; \n"
    6: "⁶ Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons,\
      \ and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters;\
      \ that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. \n"
    7: "⁷ And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away\
      \ captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye\
      \ have peace. \n"
    8: "⁸ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets\
      \ and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken\
      \ to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. \n"
    9: "⁹ For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon\
      \ I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return\
      \ to this place. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts\
      \ of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. \n"
    12: "¹² Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will\
      \ hearken unto you. \n"
    13: "¹³ And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all\
      \ your heart. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I will be found of you, saith the Lord: and I will turn away your\
      \ captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places\
      \ whither I have driven you, saith the Lord; and I will bring you again into\
      \ the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne\
      \ of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren\
      \ that are not gone forth with you into captivity; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword,\
      \ the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot\
      \ be eaten, they are so evil. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the\
      \ pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the\
      \ earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach,\
      \ among all the nations whither I have driven them: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord, which I sent\
      \ unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but\
      \ ye would not hear, saith the Lord. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity, whom\
      \ I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: \n"
    21: "²¹ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah,\
      \ and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name;\
      \ Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;\
      \ and he shall slay them before your eyes; \n"
    22: "²² And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which\
      \ are in Babylon, saying, The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom\
      \ the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; \n"
    23: "²³ Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery\
      \ with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which\
      \ I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, \n"
    25: "²⁵ Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou\
      \ hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and\
      \ to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that\
      \ ye should be officers in the house of the Lord, for every man that is mad,\
      \ and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in\
      \ the stocks. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh\
      \ himself a prophet to you? \n"
    28: "²⁸ For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long:\
      \ build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of\
      \ them. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the\
      \ prophet. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, \n"
    31: "³¹ Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning\
      \ Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and\
      \ I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: \n"
    32: '³² Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
      and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall
      he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the Lord; because he
      hath taught rebellion against the Lord.'
  30:
    1: "¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, \n"
    2: "² Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that\
      \ I have spoken unto thee in a book. \n"
    3: "³ For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity\
      \ of my people Israel and Judah, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to return\
      \ to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. \n"
    4: "⁴ And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning\
      \ Judah. \n"
    5: "⁵ For thus saith the Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and\
      \ not of peace. \n"
    6: "⁶ Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do\
      \ I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all\
      \ faces are turned into paleness? \n"
    7: "⁷ Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time\
      \ of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it. \n"
    8: "⁸ For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will\
      \ break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers\
      \ shall no more serve themselves of him: \n"
    9: "⁹ But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will\
      \ raise up unto them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; neither be\
      \ dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from\
      \ the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest,\
      \ and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: though I make a full\
      \ end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full\
      \ end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether\
      \ unpunished. \n"
    12: "¹² For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast\
      \ no healing medicines. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded\
      \ thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for\
      \ the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the\
      \ multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done\
      \ these things unto thee. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries,\
      \ every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall\
      \ be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds,\
      \ saith the Lord; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion,\
      \ whom no man seeketh after. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's\
      \ tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded\
      \ upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that\
      \ make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also\
      \ glorify them, and they shall not be small. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall\
      \ be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. \n"
    21: "²¹ And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed\
      \ from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach\
      \ unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    22: "²² And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. \n"
    23: "²³ Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing\
      \ whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he hath done it,
      and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye
      shall consider it.'
  31:
    1: "¹ At the same time, saith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families\
      \ of Israel, and they shall be my people. \n"
    2: "² Thus saith the Lord, The people which were left of the sword found grace\
      \ in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. \n"
    3: "³ The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with\

    4: "⁴ Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou\
      \ shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances\

    5: "⁵ Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall\
      \ plant, and shall eat them as common things. \n"
    6: "⁶ For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall\
      \ cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God. \n"
    7: "⁷ For thus saith the Lord; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the\
      \ chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people,\
      \ the remnant of Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the\
      \ coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with\
      \ child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return\
      \ thither. \n"
    9: "⁹ They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I\
      \ will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein\
      \ they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar\
      \ off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a\
      \ shepherd doth his flock. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him\
      \ that was stronger than he. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow\
      \ together to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil,\
      \ and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as\
      \ a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together:\
      \ for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them\
      \ rejoice from their sorrow. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people\
      \ shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thus saith the Lord; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter\
      \ weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children,\
      \ because they were not. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from\
      \ tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come\
      \ again from the land of the enemy. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall\
      \ come again to their own border. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised\
      \ me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou\
      \ me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed,\
      \ I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did\
      \ bear the reproach of my youth. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against\
      \ him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for\
      \ him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the\
      \ highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel,\
      \ turn again to these thy cities. \n"
    22: "²² How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord\
      \ hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. \n"
    23: "²³ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use\
      \ this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring\
      \ again their captivity; The Lord bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain\
      \ of holiness. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together,\
      \ husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful\
      \ soul. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the house of Israel\
      \ and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck\
      \ up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict;\
      \ so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord. \n"
    29: "²⁹ In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape,\
      \ and the children's teeth are set on edge. \n"
    30: "³⁰ But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the\
      \ sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. \n"
    31: "³¹ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant\
      \ with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: \n"
    32: "³² Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day\
      \ that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which\
      \ my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord:\
      \ \n"
    33: "³³ But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel;\
      \ After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts,\
      \ and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my\
      \ people. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his\
      \ brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least\
      \ of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their\
      \ iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the\
      \ ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth\
      \ the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name: \n"
    36: "³⁶ If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed\
      \ of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations\
      \ of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel\
      \ for all that they have done, saith the Lord. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built to\
      \ the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill\
      \ Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. \n"
    40: ⁴⁰ And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the
      fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the
      east, shall be holy unto the Lord; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down
      any more for ever.
  32:
    1: "¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah\
      \ king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. \n"
    2: "² For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the\
      \ prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's\
      \ house. \n"
    3: "³ For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou\
      \ prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into\
      \ the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; \n"
    4: "⁴ And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans,\
      \ but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall\
      \ speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; \n"
    5: "⁵ And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit\
      \ him, saith the Lord: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, \n"
    7: "⁷ Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying,\
      \ Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine\
      \ to buy it. \n"
    8: "⁸ So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according\
      \ to the word of the Lord, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that\
      \ is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance\
      \ is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that\
      \ this was the word of the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth,\
      \ and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and\
      \ weighed him the money in the balances. \n"
    11: "¹¹ So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according\
      \ to the law and custom, and that which was open: \n"
    12: "¹² And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,\
      \ the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the\
      \ presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before\
      \ all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. \n"
    13: "¹³ And I charged Baruch before them, saying, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences,\
      \ this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which\
      \ is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields\
      \ and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the\
      \ son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord, saying, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great\
      \ power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity\

      \ Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all\
      \ the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and\
      \ according to the fruit of his doings: \n"
    20: "²⁰ Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this\
      \ day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at\
      \ this day; \n"
    21: "²¹ And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with\
      \ signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out\
      \ arm, and with great terror; \n"
    22: "²² And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers\
      \ to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; \n"
    23: "²³ And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither\
      \ walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them\
      \ to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them: \n"
    24: "²⁴ Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city\
      \ is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of\
      \ the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken\
      \ is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And thou hast said unto me, O Lord God, Buy thee the field for money,\
      \ and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, \n"
    27: "²⁷ Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard\
      \ for me? \n"
    28: "²⁸ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this city into the\
      \ hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,\
      \ and he shall take it: \n"
    29: "²⁹ And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire\
      \ on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered\
      \ incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke\
      \ me to anger. \n"
    30: "³⁰ For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil\
      \ before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked\
      \ me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the Lord. \n"
    31: "³¹ For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my\
      \ fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove\
      \ it from before my face, \n"
    32: "³² Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children\
      \ of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings,\
      \ their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and\
      \ the inhabitants of Jerusalem. \n"
    33: "³³ And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught\
      \ them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive\
      \ instruction. \n"
    34: "³⁴ But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name,\
      \ to defile it. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the\
      \ son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the\
      \ fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind,\
      \ that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. \n"
    36: "³⁶ And now therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this\
      \ city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon\
      \ by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; \n"
    37: "³⁷ Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven\
      \ them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them\

    38: "³⁸ And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: \n"
    39: "³⁹ And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for\
      \ ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn\
      \ away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that\
      \ they shall not depart from me. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in\
      \ this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. \n"
    42: "⁴² For thus saith the Lord; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon\
      \ this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.\
      \ \n"
    43: "⁴³ And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate\
      \ without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them,
      and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem,
      and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities
      of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity

  33:
    1: "¹ Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time, while\

    3: "³ Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things,\

    5: "⁵ They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead\

      \ whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. \n"
    6: "⁶ Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will\

    7: "⁷ And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return,\

    8: "⁸ And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned\
      \ against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned,\
      \ and whereby they have transgressed against me. \n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the\
      \ nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and\
      \ they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity\
      \ that I procure unto it. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Thus saith the Lord; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye\

      \ Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and\
      \ without inhabitant, and without beast, \n"
    11: "¹¹ The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom,\

    12: "¹² Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without\

    11: "¹¹ But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,\
      \ whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for\
      \ servants and for handmaids. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers\
      \ in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the\
      \ house of bondmen, saying, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which\
      \ hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt\
      \ let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither\
      \ inclined their ear. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming\
      \ liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in\
      \ the house which is called by my name: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant,\
      \ and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure,\
      \ to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and\
      \ for handmaids. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming\
      \ liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold,\
      \ I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence,\
      \ and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms\
      \ of the earth. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have\
      \ not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when\
      \ they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the\
      \ priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of\
      \ the calf; \n"
    20: "²⁰ I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand\
      \ of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto\
      \ the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. \n"
    21: "²¹ And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of\
      \ their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the\
      \ hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. \n"
    22: '²² Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and cause them to return to this
      city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and
      I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.'
  35:
    1: "¹ The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim\
      \ the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, \n"
    2: "² Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them\
      \ into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to\
      \ drink. \n"
    3: "³ Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his\
      \ brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; \n"
    4: "⁴ And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons\
      \ of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the\
      \ princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper\
      \ of the door: \n"
    5: "⁵ And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine,\
      \ and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. \n"
    6: "⁶ But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our\
      \ father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your\
      \ sons for ever: \n"
    7: "⁷ Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have\
      \ any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days\
      \ in the land where ye be strangers. \n"
    8: "⁸ Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in\
      \ all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives,\
      \ our sons, nor our daughters; \n"
    9: "⁹ Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field,\
      \ nor seed: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all\
      \ that Jonadab our father commanded us. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into\
      \ the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army\
      \ of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    12: "¹² Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, \n"
    13: "¹³ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of\
      \ Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to\
      \ hearken to my words? saith the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not\
      \ to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey\
      \ their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising\
      \ early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early\
      \ and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend\
      \ your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell\
      \ in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not\
      \ inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment\
      \ of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened\
      \ unto me: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,\
      \ I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the\
      \ evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them,\
      \ but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the Lord\
      \ of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab\
      \ your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he\
      \ hath commanded you: \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the
      son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
  36:
    1: "¹ And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king\
      \ of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, \n"
    2: "² Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have\

      \ from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose\
      \ to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I\
      \ may forgive their iniquity and their sin. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the\
      \ mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him,\
      \ upon a roll of a book. \n"
    5: "⁵ And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the\
      \ house of the Lord: \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my\
      \ mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord's house\
      \ upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah\
      \ that come out of their cities. \n"
    7: "⁷ It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord, and will\
      \ return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that\
      \ the Lord hath pronounced against this people. \n"
    8: "⁸ And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet\
      \ commanded him, reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king\
      \ of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord\
      \ to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities\
      \ of Judah unto Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the\
      \ Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher\
      \ court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord's house, in the ears of all\
      \ the people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of\
      \ the book all the words of the Lord, \n"
    12: "¹² Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and,\
      \ lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son\
      \ of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan,\
      \ and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when\
      \ Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of\
      \ Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll\
      \ wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the\
      \ son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch\
      \ read it in their ears. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid\
      \ both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of\
      \ all these words. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these\
      \ words at his mouth? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with\
      \ his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and\
      \ let no man know where ye be. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll\
      \ in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears\
      \ of the king. \n"
    21: "²¹ So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama\
      \ the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the\
      \ ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. \n"
    22: "²² Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was\
      \ a fire on the hearth burning before him. \n"
    23: "²³ And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he\
      \ cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth,\
      \ until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor\
      \ any of his servants that heard all these words. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to\
      \ the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the\
      \ son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe\
      \ and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord hid them. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned\
      \ the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that\
      \ were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord; Thou\
      \ hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The\
      \ king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause\
      \ to cease from thence man and beast? \n"
    30: "³⁰ Therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have\
      \ none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out\
      \ in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. \n"
    31: "³¹ And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity;\
      \ and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon\
      \ the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they\
      \ hearkened not. \n"
    32: '³² Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the
      son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of
      the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were
      added besides unto them many like words.'
  37:
    1: "¹ And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of\
      \ Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken\
      \ unto the words of the Lord, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. \n"
    3: "³ And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the\
      \ son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto\
      \ the Lord our God for us. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put\
      \ him into prison. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans\
      \ that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah saying, \n"
    7: "⁷ Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of\
      \ Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which\
      \ is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take\
      \ it, and burn it with fire. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus saith the Lord; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall\
      \ surely depart from us: for they shall not depart. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against\
      \ you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up\
      \ every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up\
      \ from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, \n"
    12: "¹² Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,\
      \ to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. \n"
    13: "¹³ And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there,\
      \ whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But\
      \ he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put\
      \ him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that\
      \ the prison. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah\
      \ had remained there many days; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him\
      \ secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah\
      \ said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the\
      \ king of Babylon. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against\
      \ thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me\
      \ in prison? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king\
      \ of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? \n"
    20: "²⁰ Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication,\
      \ I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to\
      \ the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. \n"
    21: ²¹ Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into
      the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread
      out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus
      Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
  38:
    1: "¹ Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal\
      \ the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that\
      \ Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, \n"
    2: "² Thus saith the Lord, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword,\
      \ by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans\
      \ shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live. \n"
    3: "³ Thus saith the Lord, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the\
      \ king of Babylon's army, which shall take it. \n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man\
      \ be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain\
      \ in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto\
      \ them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is\
      \ not he that can do any thing against you. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son\
      \ of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah\
      \ with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk\
      \ in the mire. \n"
    7: "⁷ Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's\
      \ house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting\
      \ in the gate of Benjamin; \n"
    8: "⁸ Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like\
      \ to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in\
      \ the city. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence\
      \ thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon,\
      \ before he die. \n"
    11: "¹¹ So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king\
      \ under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and\
      \ let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. \n"
    12: "¹² And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast\
      \ clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah\
      \ did so. \n"
    13: "¹³ So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon:\
      \ and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into\
      \ the third entry that is in the house of the Lord: and the king said unto Jeremiah,\
      \ I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou\
      \ not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken\
      \ unto me? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the Lord\
      \ liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will\
      \ I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts,\
      \ the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's\
      \ princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with\
      \ fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall\
      \ this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it\
      \ with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that\
      \ are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they\
      \ mock me. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee,\
      \ the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee,\
      \ and thy soul shall live. \n"
    21: "²¹ But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed\
      \ me: \n"
    22: "²² And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house\
      \ shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall\
      \ say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet\
      \ are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back. \n"
    23: "²³ So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans:\
      \ and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand\
      \ of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and\
      \ thou shalt not die. \n"
    25: "²⁵ But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto\
      \ thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the\
      \ king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the\
      \ king said unto thee: \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the\
      \ king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them\
      \ according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off\
      \ speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. \n"
    28: '²⁸ So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem
      was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.'
  39:
    1: "¹ In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar\
      \ king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day\
      \ of the month, the city was broken up. \n"
    3: "³ And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle\
      \ gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer,\
      \ Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. \n"
    4: "⁴ And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and\
      \ all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night,\
      \ by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he\
      \ went out the way of the plain. \n"
    5: "⁵ But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the\
      \ plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon\
      \ him. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his\
      \ eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. \n"
    7: "⁷ Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry\
      \ him to Babylon. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people,\
      \ with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon\
      \ the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away,\
      \ that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people,\
      \ which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields\
      \ at the same time. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to\
      \ Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, \n"
    12: "¹² Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even\
      \ as he shall say unto thee. \n"
    13: "¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris,\
      \ and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and\
      \ committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he\
      \ should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the\
      \ court of the prison, saying, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the Lord\
      \ of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city\
      \ for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before\
      \ thee. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not\
      \ be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword,
      but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust
      in me, saith the Lord.'
  40:
    1: "¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after that Nebuzaradan the\
      \ captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being\
      \ bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and\
      \ Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon. \n"
    2: "² And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Lord\
      \ thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. \n"
    3: "³ Now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because\
      \ ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore\
      \ this thing is come upon you. \n"
    4: "⁴ And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine\
      \ hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I\
      \ will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into\
      \ Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth\
      \ good and convenient for thee to go, thither go. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the\
      \ son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor\
      \ over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever\
      \ it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him\
      \ victuals and a reward, and let him go. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt\
      \ with him among the people that were left in the land. \n"
    7: "⁷ Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they\
      \ and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of\
      \ Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and\
      \ children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away\
      \ captive to Babylon; \n"
    8: "⁸ Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,\
      \ and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth,\
      \ and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite,\
      \ they and their men. \n"
    9: "⁹ And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to\
      \ their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and\
      \ serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which\
      \ will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and\
      \ put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites,\
      \ and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon\
      \ had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son\
      \ of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; \n"
    12: "¹² Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven,\
      \ and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine\
      \ and summer fruits very much. \n"
    13: "¹³ Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces\
      \ that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the\
      \ Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah\
      \ the son of Ahikam believed them not. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying,\
      \ Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and\
      \ no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which\
      \ are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou
      shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.'
  41:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah\
      \ the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even\
      \ ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there\
      \ they did eat bread together in Mizpah. \n"
    2: "² Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with\
      \ him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword,\
      \ and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. \n"
    3: "³ Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at\
      \ Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. \n"
    4: "⁴ And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man\
      \ knew it, \n"
    5: "⁵ That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even\
      \ fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having\
      \ cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to\
      \ the house of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping\
      \ all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them,\
      \ Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. \n"
    7: "⁷ And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the\
      \ son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and\
      \ the men that were with him. \n"
    8: "⁸ But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for\
      \ we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of\
      \ honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom\
      \ he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear\
      \ of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with\
      \ them that were slain. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were\
      \ in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in\
      \ Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah\
      \ the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive,\
      \ and departed to go over to the Ammonites. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces\
      \ that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah\
      \ had done, \n"
    12: "¹² Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of\
      \ Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. \n"
    13: "¹³ Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael\
      \ saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were\
      \ with him, then they were glad. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast\
      \ about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,\
      \ and went to the Ammonites. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces\
      \ that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from\
      \ Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah\
      \ the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children,\
      \ and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by\
      \ Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
      the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of
      Babylon made governor in the land.'
  42:
    1: "¹ Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and\
      \ Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto\
      \ the greatest, came near, \n"
    2: "² And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication\
      \ be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord thy God, even for all\
      \ this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold\
      \ us:) \n"
    3: "³ That the Lord thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing\
      \ that we may do. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will\
      \ pray unto the Lord your God according to your words; and it shall come to\
      \ pass, that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you, I will declare it unto\
      \ you; I will keep nothing back from you. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful witness between\
      \ us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God\
      \ shall send thee to us. \n"
    6: "⁶ Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the\
      \ Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey\
      \ the voice of the Lord our God. \n"
    7: "⁷ And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord came unto\
      \ Jeremiah. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces\
      \ which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto whom ye\
      \ sent me to present your supplication before him; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull\
      \ you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the\
      \ evil that I have done unto you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid\
      \ of him, saith the Lord: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you\
      \ from his hand. \n"
    12: "¹² And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and\
      \ cause you to return to your own land. \n"
    13: "¹³ But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice\
      \ of the Lord your God, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see\
      \ no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there\
      \ will we dwell: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And now therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah; Thus\
      \ saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to\
      \ enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake\
      \ you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall\
      \ follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt\
      \ to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:\
      \ and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon\
      \ them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and\
      \ my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall\
      \ my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall\
      \ be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye\
      \ shall see this place no more. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into\
      \ Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the Lord your God,\
      \ saying, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and according unto all that the\
      \ Lord our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it. \n"
    21: "²¹ And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the\
      \ voice of the Lord your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto\
      \ you. \n"
    22: ²² Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine,
      and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
  43:
    1: "¹ And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto\
      \ all the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their\
      \ God had sent him to them, even all these words, \n"
    2: "² Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and\
      \ all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lord our\

    3: "³ But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver\
      \ us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry\
      \ us away captives into Babylon. \n"
    4: "⁴ So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all\
      \ the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took\

      \ Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of\
      \ Neriah. \n"
    7: "⁷ So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the\
      \ Lord: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, \n"
    9: "⁹ Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln,\
      \ which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the\
      \ men of Judah; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,\

    11: "¹¹ And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such\
      \ as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and\
      \ such as are for the sword to the sword. \n"
    12: "¹² And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall\
      \ burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the\
      \ land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth\
      \ from thence in peace. \n"
    13: ¹³ He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt;
      and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
  44:
    1: "¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the\

    4: "⁴ Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending\

    7: "⁷ Therefore now thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel;\

    19: "¹⁹ And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink\
      \ offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink\
      \ offerings unto her, without our men? \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women,\
      \ and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, \n"
    21: "²¹ The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets\
      \ of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the\
      \ people of the land, did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his\
      \ mind? \n"
    22: "²² So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings,\
      \ and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your\
      \ land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant,\
      \ as at this day. \n"
    23: "²³ Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the\
      \ Lord, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, nor walked in his law, nor\
      \ in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto\
      \ you, as at this day. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear\
      \ the word of the Lord, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: \n"
    25: "²⁵ Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives\
      \ have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We\
      \ will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen\
      \ of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish\
      \ your vows, and surely perform your vows. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the land\
      \ of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name\
      \ shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of\
      \ Egypt, saying, The Lord God liveth. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the\
      \ men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword\
      \ and by the famine, until there be an end of them. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land\
      \ of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone\
      \ into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand,\
      \ mine, or their's. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the Lord, that I will punish\
      \ you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against\
      \ you for evil: \n"
    30: ³⁰ Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into
      the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I
      gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
      his enemy, and that sought his life.

    29: "²⁹ Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to\
      \ themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they\
      \ shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the\
      \ Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and\

    31: "³¹ Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care,\

    37: "³⁷ For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before\

    3: "³ For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make\
      \ her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall\

    4: "⁴ In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel\

    7: "⁷ All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend\

    8: "⁸ Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the\

    14: "¹⁴ Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend\

    42: "⁴² They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew\

      \ of Babylon. \n"
    43: "⁴³ The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed\
      \ feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto\

    45: "⁴⁵ Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against\

    46: ⁴⁶ At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is
      heard among the nations.
  51:
    1: "¹ Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against\
      \ them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying\

    2: "² And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty\

      \ \n"
    3: "³ Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that\

      \ ye utterly all her host. \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are\
      \ thrust through in her streets. \n"
    5: "⁵ For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of\
      \ hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not\
      \ cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord's vengeance; he\
      \ will render unto her a recompence. \n"
    7: "⁷ Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth\
      \ drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her\
      \ pain, if so be she may be healed. \n"
    9: "⁹ We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let\
      \ us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven,\

    10: "¹⁰ The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare\
      \ in Zion the work of the Lord our God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord hath raised up the\
      \ spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy\
      \ it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong,\
      \ set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both devised\
      \ and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. \n"
    13: "¹³ O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end\
      \ is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee\
      \ with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by\

    16: "¹⁶ When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens;\
      \ and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh\
      \ lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by\
      \ the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath\
      \ in them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they\
      \ shall perish. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things:\
      \ and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break\
      \ in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; \n"
    21: "²¹ And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with\
      \ thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; \n"
    22: "²² With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will\
      \ I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the\
      \ young man and the maid; \n"
    23: "²³ I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and\
      \ with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and\

    24: "²⁴ And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all\
      \ their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which\
      \ destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and\
      \ roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for\
      \ foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the Lord. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations,\
      \ prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of\
      \ Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses\

    28: "²⁸ Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains\
      \ thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the Lord shall\
      \ be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without\
      \ an inhabitant. \n"
    30: "³⁰ The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in\
      \ their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned\
      \ her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. \n"
    31: "³¹ One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another,\
      \ to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end, \n"
    32: "³² And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with\
      \ fire, and the men of war are affrighted. \n"
    33: "³³ For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon\
      \ is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and\
      \ the time of her harvest shall come. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me,\
      \ he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he\
      \ hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. \n"
    35: "³⁵ The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant\
      \ of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem\
      \ say. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take\
      \ vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. \n"
    37: "³⁷ And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment,\

    38: "³⁸ They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.\
      \ \n"
    39: "³⁹ In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken,\

    40: "⁴⁰ I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he\

    41: "⁴¹ How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised!\
      \ how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! \n"
    42: "⁴² The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of\

    43: "⁴³ Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein\

    47: "⁴⁷ Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven\
      \ images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain\

    48: "⁴⁸ Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for\
      \ Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the Lord.\

    54: "⁵⁴ A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land\

    55: "⁵⁵ Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great\
      \ voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is\
      \ uttered: \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty\

      \ shall surely requite. \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and\

    61: "⁶¹ And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see,\

      \ the king of Babylon. \n"
    4: "⁴ And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,\
      \ in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he\
      \ and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts\
      \ against it round about. \n"
    5: "⁵ So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. \n"
    6: "⁶ And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore\
      \ in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth\
      \ out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which\
      \ was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:)\
      \ and they went by the way of the plain. \n"
    8: "⁸ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah\
      \ in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to\
      \ Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he\
      \ slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him\
      \ in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day\
      \ of his death. \n"
    12: "¹² Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth\
      \ year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard,\
      \ which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, \n"
    13: "¹³ And burned the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses\
      \ of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard,\
      \ brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain\
      \ of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in\
      \ the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and\
      \ the rest of the multitude. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the\
      \ land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the\
      \ bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans\
      \ brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and\
      \ the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they\
      \ away. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and\
      \ the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in\
      \ gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard\
      \ away. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the\
      \ bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord: the brass of\
      \ all these vessels was without weight. \n"
    21: "²¹ And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits;\
      \ and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was\
      \ four fingers: it was hollow. \n"
    22: "²² And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was\
      \ five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about,\
      \ all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates\
      \ upon the network were an hundred round about. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah\
      \ the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: \n"
    25: "²⁵ He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men\
      \ of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were\
      \ found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the\
      \ people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were\
      \ found in the midst of the city. \n"
    26: "²⁶ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to\
      \ the king of Babylon to Riblah. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in\
      \ the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh\
      \ year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: \n"
    29: "²⁹ In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from\
      \ Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: \n"
    30: "³⁰ In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain\
      \ of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five\
      \ persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. \n"
    31: "³¹ And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of\
      \ Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth\
      \ day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his\
      \ reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth\
      \ out of prison. \n"
    32: "³² And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the\
      \ kings that were with him in Babylon, \n"
    33: "³³ And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before\
      \ him all the days of his life. \n"
    34: ³⁴ And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon,
      every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
