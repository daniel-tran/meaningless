Haggai:
  1:
    1: "¹ In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first\
      \ day of the month, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel\
      \ the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech,\
      \ the high priest, saying, \n"
    2: "² Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not\
      \ come, the time that the Lord's house should be built. \n"
    3: "³ Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying, \n"
    4: "⁴ Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house\
      \ lie waste? \n"
    5: "⁵ Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. \n"
    6: "⁶ Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough;\
      \ ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none\
      \ warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. \n"
    8: "⁸ Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take\
      \ pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought it home,\
      \ I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that\
      \ is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed\
      \ from her fruit. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and\
      \ upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which\
      \ the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the\
      \ labour of the hands. \n"
    12: "¹² Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech,\
      \ the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the\
      \ Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God\
      \ had sent him, and the people did fear before the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then spake Haggai the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the\
      \ people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,\
      \ governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high\
      \ priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and\
      \ did work in the house of the Lord of hosts, their God, \n"
    15: ¹⁵ In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of
      Darius the king.
  2:
    1: "¹ In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the\
      \ word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai, saying, \n"
    2: "² Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to\
      \ Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people,\
      \ saying, \n"
    3: "³ Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do\
      \ ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? \n"
    4: "⁴ Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua,\
      \ son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land,\
      \ saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts: \n"
    5: "⁵ According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt,\
      \ so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. \n"
    6: "⁶ For thus saith the Lord of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I\
      \ will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; \n"
    7: "⁷ And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come:\
      \ and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. \n"
    8: "⁸ The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. \n"
    9: "⁹ The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith\
      \ the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of\
      \ hosts. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of\
      \ Darius, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying, \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law,\
      \ saying, \n"
    12: "¹² If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt\
      \ do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?\
      \ And the priests answered and said, No. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these,\
      \ shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation\
      \ before me, saith the Lord; and so is every work of their hands; and that which\
      \ they offer there is unclean. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a\
      \ stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there\
      \ were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels\
      \ out of the press, there were but twenty. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours\
      \ of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day\
      \ of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple\
      \ was laid, consider it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and\
      \ the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day\
      \ will I bless you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth\
      \ day of the month, saying, \n"
    21: "²¹ Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens\
      \ and the earth; \n"
    22: "²² And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength\
      \ of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those\
      \ that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every\
      \ one by the sword of his brother. \n"
    23: '²³ In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel,
      my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet:
      for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.'
