Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become\
      \ as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces,\
      \ how is she become tributary! \n"
    2: "² She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all\
      \ her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously\
      \ with her, they are become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great\
      \ servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors\
      \ overtook her between the straits. \n"
    4: "⁴ The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her\
      \ gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is\
      \ in bitterness. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the Lord hath afflicted\
      \ her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity\
      \ before the enemy. \n"
    6: "⁶ And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are\
      \ become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength\
      \ before the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all\
      \ her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell\
      \ into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her,\
      \ and did mock at her sabbaths. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured\
      \ her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and\
      \ turneth backward. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore\
      \ she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O Lord, behold my affliction:\
      \ for the enemy hath magnified himself. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for\
      \ she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst\
      \ command that they should not enter into thy congregation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things\
      \ for meat to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider; for I am become vile.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be\
      \ any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord\
      \ hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. \n"
    13: "¹³ From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against\
      \ them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made\
      \ me desolate and faint all the day. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed,\
      \ and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath\
      \ delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me:\
      \ he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath\
      \ trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because\
      \ the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are\
      \ desolate, because the enemy prevailed. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the\
      \ Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round\
      \ about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear,\
      \ I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men\
      \ are gone into captivity. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders\
      \ gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their\
      \ souls. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Behold, O Lord; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart\
      \ is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth,\
      \ at home there is as death. \n"
    21: "²¹ They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies\
      \ have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt\
      \ bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me. \n"
    22: '²² Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast
      done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart
      is faint.'
  2:
    1: "¹ How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,\
      \ and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered\
      \ not his footstool in the day of his anger! \n"
    2: "² The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied:\
      \ he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah;\
      \ he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and\
      \ the princes thereof. \n"
    3: "³ He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn\
      \ back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like\
      \ a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. \n"
    4: "⁴ He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary,\
      \ and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter\
      \ of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed\
      \ up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased\
      \ in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. \n"
    6: "⁶ And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden:\
      \ he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the Lord hath caused the solemn\
      \ feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation\
      \ of his anger the king and the priest. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath\
      \ given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made\
      \ a noise in the house of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath\
      \ stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore\
      \ he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars:\
      \ her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets\
      \ also find no vision from the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence:\
      \ they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with\
      \ sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured\
      \ upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because\
      \ the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. \n"
    12: "¹² They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as\
      \ the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into\
      \ their mothers' bosom. \n"
    13: "¹³ What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken\
      \ to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort\
      \ thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who\
      \ can heal thee? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have\
      \ not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for\
      \ thee false burdens and causes of banishment. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head\
      \ at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection\
      \ of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and\
      \ gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the\
      \ day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word\
      \ that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not\
      \ pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up\
      \ the horn of thine adversaries. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears\
      \ run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple\
      \ of thine eye cease. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out\
      \ thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward\
      \ him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of\
      \ every street. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women\
      \ eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet\
      \ be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and\
      \ my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine\
      \ anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied. \n"
    22: "²² Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in\
      \ the day of the Lord's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled\
      \ and brought up hath mine enemy consumed."
  3:
    1: "¹ I Am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. \n"
    2: "² He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. \n"
    3: "³ Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. \n"
    5: "⁵ He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. \n"
    6: "⁶ He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. \n"
    7: "⁷ He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. \n"
    9: "⁹ He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me\
      \ desolate. \n"
    12: "¹² He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. \n"
    13: "¹³ He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with\
      \ ashes. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. \n"
    21: "²¹ This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. \n"
    22: "²² It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions\
      \ fail not. \n"
    23: "²³ They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. \n"
    24: "²⁴ The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh\
      \ him. \n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. \n"
    28: "²⁸ He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. \n"
    30: "³⁰ He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not cast off for ever: \n"
    32: "³² But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the\
      \ multitude of his mercies. \n"
    33: "³³ For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. \n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth. \n"
    35: "³⁵ To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, \n"
    36: "³⁶ To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth\
      \ it not? \n"
    38: "³⁸ Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? \n"
    39: "³⁹ Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his\
      \ sins? \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. \n"
    42: "⁴² We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. \n"
    43: "⁴³ Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou\
      \ hast not pitied. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass\
      \ through. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.\
      \ \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the\
      \ daughter of my people. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Till the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. \n"
    51: "⁵¹ Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.\
      \ \n"
    52: "⁵² Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. \n"
    53: "⁵³ They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.\
      \ \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear\
      \ not. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my\
      \ life. \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. \n"
    60: "⁶⁰ Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against\
      \ me. \n"
    61: "⁶¹ Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, and all their imaginations against\
      \ me; \n"
    62: "⁶² The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me\
      \ all the day. \n"
    63: "⁶³ Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. \n"
    64: "⁶⁴ Render unto them a recompence, O Lord, according to the work of their\
      \ hands. \n"
    65: "⁶⁵ Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. \n"
    66: ⁶⁶ Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord.
  4:
    1: "¹ How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones\
      \ of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. \n"
    2: "² The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed\
      \ as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! \n"
    3: "³ Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young\
      \ ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the\
      \ wilderness. \n"
    4: "⁴ The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:\
      \ the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. \n"
    5: "⁵ They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were\
      \ brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. \n"
    6: "⁶ For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater\
      \ than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment,\
      \ and no hands stayed on her. \n"
    7: "⁷ Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were\
      \ more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: \n"
    8: "⁸ Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:\
      \ their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with\
      \ hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the\
      \ field. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were\
      \ their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger,\
      \ and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not\
      \ have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the\
      \ gates of Jerusalem. \n"
    13: "¹³ For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that\
      \ have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves\
      \ with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch\
      \ not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall\
      \ no more sojourn there. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more regard them:\
      \ they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we\
      \ have watched for a nation that could not save us. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near,\
      \ our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued\
      \ us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their\
      \ pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. \n"
    21: "²¹ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of\
      \ Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and\
      \ shalt make thyself naked. \n"
    22: '²² The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;
      he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity,
      O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.'
  5:
    1: "¹ Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. \n"
    3: "³ We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. \n"
    4: "⁴ We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. \n"
    5: "⁵ Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. \n"
    6: "⁶ We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied\
      \ with bread. \n"
    7: "⁷ Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their\
      \ hand. \n"
    9: "⁹ We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the\
      \ wilderness. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. \n"
    11: "¹¹ They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon\
      \ it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? \n"
    21: "²¹ Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days\
      \ as of old. \n"
    22: ²² But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
