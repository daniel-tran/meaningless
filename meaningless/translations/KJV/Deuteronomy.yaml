Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: "¹ These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan\
      \ in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and\
      \ Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. \n"
    2: "² (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto\
      \ Kadeshbarnea.) \n"
    3: "³ And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the\
      \ first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according\
      \ unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them; \n"
    4: "⁴ After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon,\
      \ and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: \n"
    5: "⁵ On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law,\
      \ saying, \n"
    6: "⁶ The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough\
      \ in this mount: \n"
    7: "⁷ Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and\
      \ unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the\
      \ vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites,\
      \ and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. \n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which\
      \ the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto\
      \ them and to their seed after them. \n"
    9: "⁹ And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself\
      \ alone: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as\
      \ the stars of heaven for multitude. \n"
    11: "¹¹ (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as\
      \ ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) \n"
    12: "¹² How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your\
      \ strife? \n"
    13: "¹³ Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and\
      \ I will make them rulers over you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good\
      \ for us to do. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them\
      \ heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains\
      \ over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between\
      \ your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and\
      \ the stranger that is with him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small\
      \ as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment\
      \ is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I\
      \ will hear it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible\
      \ wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the\
      \ Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which\
      \ the Lord our God doth give unto us. \n"
    21: "²¹ Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess\
      \ it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither\
      \ be discouraged. \n"
    22: "²² And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men\
      \ before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again\
      \ by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. \n"
    23: "²³ And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a\
      \ tribe: \n"
    24: "²⁴ And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley\
      \ of Eshcol, and searched it out. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it\
      \ down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which\
      \ the Lord our God doth give us. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment\
      \ of the Lord your God: \n"
    27: "²⁷ And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he\
      \ hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand\
      \ of the Amorites, to destroy us. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying,\
      \ The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled\
      \ up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. \n"
    30: "³⁰ The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according\
      \ to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; \n"
    31: "³¹ And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God\
      \ bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until\
      \ ye came into this place. \n"
    32: "³² Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God, \n"
    33: "³³ Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your\
      \ tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a\
      \ cloud by day. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,\
      \ saying, \n"
    35: "³⁵ Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that\
      \ good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give\
      \ the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly\
      \ followed the Lord. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt\
      \ not go in thither. \n"
    38: "³⁸ But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in\
      \ thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children,\
      \ which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in\
      \ thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by\
      \ the way of the Red sea. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord, we\
      \ will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us.\
      \ And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go\
      \ up into the hill. \n"
    42: "⁴² And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for\
      \ I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. \n"
    43: "⁴³ So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment\
      \ of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you,\
      \ and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken\
      \ to your voice, nor give ear unto you. \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode
      there.
  2:
    1: "¹ Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the\
      \ Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And the Lord spake unto me, saying, \n"
    3: "³ Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. \n"
    4: "⁴ And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of\
      \ your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be\
      \ afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: \n"
    5: "⁵ Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so\
      \ much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also\
      \ buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. \n"
    7: "⁷ For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he\
      \ knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord\
      \ thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. \n"
    8: "⁸ And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt\
      \ in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we\
      \ turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with\
      \ them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because\
      \ I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall,\
      \ as the Anakims; \n"
    11: "¹¹ Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called\
      \ them Emims. \n"
    12: "¹² The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded\
      \ them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead;\
      \ as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the Lord gave unto them.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over\
      \ the brook Zered. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over\
      \ the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the\
      \ men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from\
      \ among the host, until they were consumed. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from\
      \ among the people, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ That the Lord spake unto me, saying, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress\
      \ them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the\
      \ children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children\
      \ of Lot for a possession. \n"
    20: "²⁰ (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old\
      \ time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; \n"
    21: "²¹ A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord destroyed\
      \ them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: \n"
    22: "²² As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed\
      \ the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead\
      \ even unto this day: \n"
    23: "²³ And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims,\
      \ which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold,\
      \ I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land:\
      \ begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. \n"
    25: "²⁵ This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon\
      \ the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee,\
      \ and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king\
      \ of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, \n"
    27: "²⁷ Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will\
      \ neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for\
      \ money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; \n"
    29: "²⁹ (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell\
      \ in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the\
      \ Lord our God giveth us. \n"
    30: "³⁰ But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord thy\
      \ God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver\
      \ him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. \n"
    31: "³¹ And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his\
      \ land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. \n"
    32: "³² Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.\
      \ \n"
    33: "³³ And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his\
      \ sons, and all his people. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men,\
      \ and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:\
      \ \n"
    35: "³⁵ Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the\
      \ cities which we took. \n"
    36: "³⁶ From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the\
      \ city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong\
      \ for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us: \n"
    37: ³⁷ Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any
      place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever
      the Lord our God forbad us.
  3:
    1: "¹ Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan\
      \ came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. \n"
    2: "² And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all\
      \ his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou\
      \ didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. \n"
    3: "³ So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan,\
      \ and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took\
      \ not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of\
      \ Og in Bashan. \n"
    5: "⁵ All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled\
      \ towns a great many. \n"
    6: "⁶ And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly\
      \ destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. \n"
    7: "⁷ But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites\
      \ the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount\
      \ Hermon; \n"
    9: "⁹ (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah\
      \ and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his\
      \ bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?\
      \ nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after\
      \ the cubit of a man. \n"
    12: "¹² And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by\
      \ the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto\
      \ the Reubenites and to the Gadites. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave\
      \ I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan,\
      \ which was called the land of giants. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts\
      \ of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair,\
      \ unto this day. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I gave Gilead unto Machir. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto\
      \ the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok,\
      \ which is the border of the children of Ammon; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even\
      \ unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given\
      \ you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren\
      \ the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that\
      \ ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; \n"
    20: "²⁰ Until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you,\
      \ and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them\
      \ beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which\
      \ I have given you. \n"
    21: "²¹ And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all\
      \ that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the Lord do\
      \ unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. \n"
    22: "²² Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for you.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And I besought the Lord at that time, saying, \n"
    24: "²⁴ O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy\
      \ mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according\
      \ to thy works, and according to thy might? \n"
    25: "²⁵ I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan,\
      \ that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me:\
      \ and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this\
      \ matter. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and\
      \ northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for\
      \ thou shalt not go over this Jordan. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall\
      \ go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which\
      \ thou shalt see. \n"
    29: ²⁹ So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
  4:
    1: "¹ Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments,\
      \ which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess\
      \ the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. \n"
    2: "² Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish\
      \ ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which\
      \ I command you. \n"
    3: "³ Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor: for all the men\
      \ that followed Baalpeor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you\
      \ this day. \n"
    5: "⁵ Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God\
      \ commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding\
      \ in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say,\
      \ Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. \n"
    7: "⁷ For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the\
      \ Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? \n"
    8: "⁸ And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous\
      \ as all this law, which I set before you this day? \n"
    9: "⁹ Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget\
      \ the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart\
      \ all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb,\
      \ when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make\
      \ them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they\
      \ shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned\
      \ with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the\
      \ voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform,\
      \ even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments,\
      \ that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude\
      \ on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude\
      \ of any figure, the likeness of male or female, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged\
      \ fowl that flieth in the air, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of\
      \ any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the\
      \ sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be\
      \ driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided\
      \ unto all nations under the whole heaven. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace,\
      \ even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this\
      \ day. \n"
    21: "²¹ Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that\

    5: "⁵ But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break\

    19: "¹⁹ And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after\
      \ other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day\
      \ that ye shall surely perish. \n"
    20: ²⁰ As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face, so shall ye
      perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God.
  9:
    1: "¹ Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess\
      \ nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,\
      \ \n"
    2: "² A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest,\
      \ and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over\
      \ before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring\
      \ them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them\
      \ quickly, as the Lord hath said unto thee. \n"
    4: "⁴ Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast them\
      \ out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me\
      \ in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord\
      \ doth drive them out from before thee. \n"
    5: "⁵ Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou\
      \ go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord\
      \ thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the\
      \ word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. \n"
    6: "⁶ Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land\
      \ to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people. \n"
    7: "⁷ Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath\
      \ in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of\
      \ Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    8: "⁸ Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry\
      \ with you to have destroyed you. \n"
    9: "⁹ When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the\
      \ tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode in the mount\
      \ forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger\
      \ of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the Lord\
      \ spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the\
      \ assembly. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the\
      \ Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for\
      \ thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves;\
      \ they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they\
      \ have made them a molten image. \n"
    13: "¹³ Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and,\
      \ behold, it is a stiffnecked people: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under\
      \ heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire:\
      \ and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and\
      \ had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which\
      \ the Lord had commanded you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake\
      \ them before your eyes. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty\
      \ nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins\
      \ which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him\
      \ to anger. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord\
      \ was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord hearkened unto me at that\
      \ time also. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed\
      \ for Aaron also the same time. \n"
    21: "²¹ And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire,\
      \ and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust:\
      \ and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the\
      \ Lord to wrath. \n"
    23: "²³ Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess\
      \ the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment\
      \ of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell\
      \ down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy not thy\
      \ people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness,\
      \ which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness\
      \ of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: \n"
    28: "²⁸ Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord was\
      \ not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he\
      \ hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. \n"
    29: ²⁹ Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out
      by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
  10:
    1: "¹ At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto\
      \ the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which\
      \ thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. \n"
    3: "³ And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto\
      \ the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments,\
      \ which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in\
      \ the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me. \n"
    5: "⁵ And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in\
      \ the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children\
      \ of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar\
      \ his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. \n"
    7: "⁷ From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath,\
      \ a land of rivers of waters. \n"
    8: "⁸ At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the\
      \ covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to\
      \ bless in his name, unto this day. \n"
    9: "⁹ Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord\
      \ is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and\
      \ forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the Lord\
      \ would not destroy thee. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people,\
      \ that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers\
      \ to give unto them. \n"
    12: "¹² And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear\
      \ the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the\
      \ Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, \n"
    13: "¹³ To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command\
      \ thee this day for thy good? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord's thy God, the\
      \ earth also, with all that therein is. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose\
      \ their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God,\
      \ a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the\
      \ stranger, in giving him food and raiment. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt\
      \ thou cleave, and swear by his name. \n"
    21: "²¹ He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great\
      \ and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. \n"
    22: ²² Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now
      the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
  11:
    1: "¹ Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge, and his\
      \ statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. \n"
    2: "² And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not\
      \ known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, his\
      \ greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, \n"
    3: "³ And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto\
      \ Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; \n"
    4: "⁴ And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their\
      \ chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued\
      \ after you, and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day; \n"
    5: "⁵ And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben:\
      \ how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households,\

      \ midst of all Israel: \n"
    7: "⁷ But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did. \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day,\

      \ it; \n"
    9: "⁹ And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord sware unto\
      \ your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with\
      \ milk and honey. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land\
      \ of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst\
      \ it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys,\
      \ and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: \n"
    12: "¹² A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God\
      \ are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the\
      \ year. \n"
    13: "¹³ And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments\
      \ which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him\
      \ with all your heart and with all your soul, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first\

      \ and thine oil. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat\
      \ and be full. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\
      \ aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven,\
      \ that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye\
      \ perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul,\

    19: "¹⁹ And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest\

    23: "²³ Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye\

    26: "²⁶ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; \n"
    27: "²⁷ A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I\

    3: "³ And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their\

    4: "⁴ And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may\
      \ live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his\
      \ hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth\
      \ from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee\

    11: "¹¹ But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up\

    54: "⁵⁴ So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall\
      \ be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the\
      \ remnant of his children which he shall leave: \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom\
      \ he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness,\

    56: "⁵⁶ The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to\
      \ set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,\
      \ her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son,\

    58: "⁵⁸ If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written\

      \ Thy God; \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy\
      \ seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and\
      \ of long continuance. \n"
    60: "⁶⁰ Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou\
      \ wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. \n"
    61: "⁶¹ Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book\

      \ \n"
    62: "⁶² And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven\

      \ \n"
    63: "⁶³ And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you\
      \ good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you,\
      \ and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither\
      \ thou goest to possess it. \n"
    64: "⁶⁴ And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of\
      \ the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which\
      \ neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. \n"
    65: "⁶⁵ And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole\
      \ of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart,\
      \ and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: \n"
    66: "⁶⁶ And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day\
      \ and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: \n"
    67: "⁶⁷ In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou\
      \ shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith\

    68: '⁶⁸ And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way
      whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall
      be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.'
  29:
    1: "¹ These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make\

    2: "² And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that\

    3: "³ The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great\

    3: "³ The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these\

    7: "⁷ And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel,\

      \ cause them to inherit it. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he\

    9: "⁹ And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of\
      \ Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders\

    10: "¹⁰ And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in\

    11: "¹¹ When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place\

    12: "¹² Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger\

    13: "¹³ And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and\
      \ learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye\
      \ go over Jordan to possess it. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must\
      \ die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation,\
      \ that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves\
      \ in the tabernacle of the congregation. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the\
      \ pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers;\

    17: "¹⁷ Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake\
      \ them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many\
      \ evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are\
      \ not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they\
      \ shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of\
      \ Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against\
      \ the children of Israel. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their\
      \ fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled\
      \ themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve\

    21: "²¹ And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them,\

      \ sware. \n"
    22: "²² Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    23: "²³ And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of\
      \ a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land\
      \ which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of\
      \ this law in a book, until they were finished, \n"
    25: "²⁵ That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of\
      \ the Lord, saying, \n"
    26: "²⁶ Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant\
      \ of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive\
      \ with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much\
      \ more after my death? \n"
    28: "²⁸ Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that\
      \ I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record\
      \ against them. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and\
      \ turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you\
      \ in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke\
      \ him to anger through the work of your hands. \n"
    30: ³⁰ And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words
      of this song, until they were ended.
  32:
    1: "¹ Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of\
      \ my mouth. \n"
    2: "² My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as\
      \ the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: \n"
    3: "³ Because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our\
      \ God. \n"
    4: "⁴ He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God\
      \ of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. \n"
    5: "⁵ They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children:\
      \ they are a perverse and crooked generation. \n"
    6: "⁶ Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy\
      \ father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy\
      \ father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. \n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated\
      \ the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number\
      \ of the children of Israel. \n"
    9: "⁹ For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he\

    11: "¹¹ As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth\
      \ abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: \n"
    12: "¹² So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the\
      \ increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and\
      \ oil out of the flinty rock; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the\
      \ breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst\
      \ drink the pure blood of the grape. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown\
      \ thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him,\
      \ and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked\
      \ they him to anger. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to\
      \ new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God\

    19: "¹⁹ And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of\
      \ his sons, and of his daughters. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end\
      \ shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked\
      \ me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those\
      \ which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell,\
      \ and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations\

    23: "²³ I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with\
      \ bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the\

    25: "²⁵ The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man\

    26: "²⁶ I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance\

    27: "²⁷ Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries\
      \ should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is\

    28: "²⁸ For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding\
