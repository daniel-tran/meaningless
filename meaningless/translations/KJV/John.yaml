John:
  1:
    1: "¹ In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was\
      \ God. \n"
    2: "² The same was in the beginning with God. \n"
    3: "³ All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that\
      \ was made. \n"
    4: "⁴ In him was life; and the life was the light of men. \n"
    5: "⁵ And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. \n"
    7: "⁷ The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men\
      \ through him might believe. \n"
    8: "⁸ He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. \n"
    9: "⁹ That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew\
      \ him not. \n"
    11: "¹¹ He came unto his own, and his own received him not. \n"
    12: "¹² But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons\
      \ of God, even to them that believe on his name: \n"
    13: "¹³ Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the\
      \ will of man, but of God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,\
      \ the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake,\
      \ He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the\
      \ bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites\
      \ from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? \n"
    20: "²⁰ And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.\
      \ Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. \n"
    22: "²² Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them\
      \ that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? \n"
    23: "²³ He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight\
      \ the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou\
      \ be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? \n"
    26: "²⁶ John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one\
      \ among you, whom ye know not; \n"
    27: "²⁷ He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet\
      \ I am not worthy to unloose. \n"
    28: "²⁸ These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb\
      \ of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. \n"
    30: "³⁰ This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before\
      \ me: for he was before me. \n"
    31: "³¹ And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore\
      \ am I come baptizing with water. \n"
    32: "³² And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven\
      \ like a dove, and it abode upon him. \n"
    33: "³³ And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same\
      \ said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining\
      \ on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; \n"
    36: "³⁶ And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!\
      \ \n"
    37: "³⁷ And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek\
      \ ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,)\
      \ where dwellest thou? \n"
    39: "³⁹ He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and\
      \ abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon\
      \ Peter's brother. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found\
      \ the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. \n"
    42: "⁴² And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou\
      \ art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation,\
      \ A stone. \n"
    43: "⁴³ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip,\
      \ and saith unto him, Follow me. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom\
      \ Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son\
      \ of Joseph. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\
      \ Philip saith unto him, Come and see. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite\
      \ indeed, in whom is no guile! \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said\
      \ unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree,\
      \ I saw thee. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God;\
      \ thou art the King of Israel. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee\
      \ under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.\
      \ \n"
    51: ⁵¹ And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall
      see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son
      of man.
  2:
    1: "¹ And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother\
      \ of Jesus was there: \n"
    2: "² And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. \n"
    3: "³ And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have\
      \ no wine. \n"
    4: "⁴ Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not\
      \ yet come. \n"
    5: "⁵ His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the\
      \ purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. \n"
    7: "⁷ Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them\
      \ up to the brim. \n"
    8: "⁸ And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the\
      \ feast. And they bare it. \n"
    9: "⁹ When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and\
      \ knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the\
      \ governor of the feast called the bridegroom, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;\
      \ and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept\
      \ the good wine until now. \n"
    11: "¹¹ This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested\
      \ forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. \n"
    12: "¹² After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren,\
      \ and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and\
      \ the changers of money sitting: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of\
      \ the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money,\
      \ and overthrew the tables; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not\
      \ my Father's house an house of merchandise. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house\
      \ hath eaten me up. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto\
      \ us, seeing that thou doest these things? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days\
      \ I will raise it up. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and\
      \ wilt thou rear it up in three days? \n"
    21: "²¹ But he spake of the temple of his body. \n"
    22: "²² When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that\
      \ he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word\
      \ which Jesus had said. \n"
    23: "²³ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed\
      \ in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. \n"
    24: "²⁴ But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, \n"
    25: '²⁵ And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in
      man.'
  3:
    1: "¹ There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that\
      \ thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou\
      \ doest, except God be with him. \n"
    3: "³ Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except\
      \ a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. \n"
    4: "⁴ Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter\
      \ the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? \n"
    5: "⁵ Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of\
      \ water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. \n"
    6: "⁶ That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the\
      \ Spirit is spirit. \n"
    7: "⁷ Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. \n"
    8: "⁸ The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but\
      \ canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that\
      \ is born of the Spirit. \n"
    9: "⁹ Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest\
      \ not these things? \n"
    11: "¹¹ Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify\
      \ that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. \n"
    12: "¹² If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe,\
      \ if I tell you of heavenly things? \n"
    13: "¹³ And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,\
      \ even the Son of man which is in heaven. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the\
      \ Son of man be lifted up: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever\
      \ believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that\
      \ the world through him might be saved. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is\
      \ condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten\
      \ Son of God. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men\
      \ loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the\
      \ light, lest his deeds should be reproved. \n"
    21: "²¹ But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made\
      \ manifest, that they are wrought in God. \n"
    22: "²² After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea;\
      \ and there he tarried with them, and baptized. \n"
    23: "²³ And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was\
      \ much water there: and they came, and were baptized. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For John was not yet cast into prison. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews\
      \ about purifying. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee\
      \ beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and\
      \ all men come to him. \n"
    27: "²⁷ John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given\
      \ him from heaven. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that\
      \ I am sent before him. \n"
    29: "²⁹ He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom,\
      \ which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's\
      \ voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. \n"
    30: "³⁰ He must increase, but I must decrease. \n"
    31: "³¹ He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly,\
      \ and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. \n"
    32: "³² And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth\
      \ his testimony. \n"
    33: "³³ He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not\
      \ the Spirit by measure unto him. \n"
    35: "³⁵ The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. \n"
    36: '³⁶ He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth
      not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.'
  4:
    1: "¹ When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made\
      \ and baptized more disciples than John, \n"
    2: "² (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) \n"
    3: "³ He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. \n"
    4: "⁴ And he must needs go through Samaria. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the\
      \ parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey,\
      \ sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. \n"
    7: "⁷ There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give\
      \ me to drink. \n"
    8: "⁸ (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) \n"
    9: "⁹ Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew,\
      \ askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings\
      \ with the Samaritans. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and\
      \ who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of\
      \ him, and he would have given thee living water. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the\
      \ well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? \n"
    12: "¹² Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank\
      \ thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? \n"
    13: "¹³ Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall\
      \ thirst again: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never\
      \ thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water\
      \ springing up into everlasting life. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not,\
      \ neither come hither to draw. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou\
      \ hast well said, I have no husband: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy\
      \ husband: in that saidst thou truly. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem\
      \ is the place where men ought to worship. \n"
    21: "²¹ Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall\
      \ neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. \n"
    22: "²² Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is\
      \ of the Jews. \n"
    23: "²³ But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship\
      \ the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship\
      \ him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit\
      \ and in truth. \n"
    25: "²⁵ The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called\
      \ Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the\
      \ woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and\
      \ saith to the men, \n"
    29: "²⁹ Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this\
      \ the Christ? \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. \n"
    31: "³¹ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. \n"
    32: "³² But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. \n"
    33: "³³ Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him\
      \ ought to eat? \n"
    34: "³⁴ Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,\
      \ and to finish his work. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold,\
      \ I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white\
      \ already to harvest. \n"
    36: "³⁶ And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal:\
      \ that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. \n"
    37: "³⁷ And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. \n"
    38: "³⁸ I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured,\
      \ and ye are entered into their labours. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying\
      \ of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would\
      \ tarry with them: and he abode there two days. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ And many more believed because of his own word; \n"
    42: "⁴² And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for\
      \ we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the\
      \ Saviour of the world. \n"
    43: "⁴³ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own\
      \ country. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having\
      \ seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went\
      \ unto the feast. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.\
      \ And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went\
      \ unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for\
      \ he was at the point of death. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not\
      \ believe. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed\
      \ the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. \n"
    51: "⁵¹ And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying,\
      \ Thy son liveth. \n"
    52: "⁵² Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said\
      \ unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. \n"
    53: "⁵³ So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said\
      \ unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. \n"
    54: ⁵⁴ This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of
      Judaea into Galilee.
  5:
    1: "¹ After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in\
      \ the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. \n"
    3: "³ In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered,\
      \ waiting for the moving of the water. \n"
    4: "⁴ For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the\
      \ water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was\
      \ made whole of whatsoever disease he had. \n"
    5: "⁵ And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that\
      \ case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? \n"
    7: "⁷ The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled,\
      \ to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before\
      \ me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. \n"
    9: "⁹ And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked:\
      \ and on the same day was the sabbath. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day:\
      \ it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. \n"
    11: "¹¹ He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up\
      \ thy bed, and walk. \n"
    12: "¹² Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy\
      \ bed, and walk? \n"
    13: "¹³ And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself\
      \ away, a multitude being in that place. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold,\
      \ thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made\
      \ him whole. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because\
      \ he had done these things on the sabbath day. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had\
      \ broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself\
      \ equal with God. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,\
      \ The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what\
      \ things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself\
      \ doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the\
      \ Son quickeneth whom he will. \n"
    22: "²² For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the\
      \ Son: \n"
    23: "²³ That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He\
      \ that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth\
      \ on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation;\
      \ but is passed from death unto life. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the\
      \ dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to\
      \ have life in himself; \n"
    27: "²⁷ And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the\
      \ Son of man. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are\
      \ in the graves shall hear his voice, \n"
    29: "²⁹ And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection\
      \ of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment\
      \ is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which\
      \ hath sent me. \n"
    31: "³¹ If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. \n"
    32: "³² There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness\
      \ which he witnesseth of me is true. \n"
    33: "³³ Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. \n"
    34: "³⁴ But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye\
      \ might be saved. \n"
    35: "³⁵ He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season\
      \ to rejoice in his light. \n"
    36: "³⁶ But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the\
      \ Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of\
      \ me, that the Father hath sent me. \n"
    37: "³⁷ And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.\
      \ Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. \n"
    38: "³⁸ And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye\
      \ believe not. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and\
      \ they are they which testify of me. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ I receive not honour from men. \n"
    42: "⁴² But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. \n"
    43: "⁴³ I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall\
      \ come in his own name, him ye will receive. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not\
      \ the honour that cometh from God only? \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth\
      \ you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of\
      \ me. \n"
    47: ⁴⁷ But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

    1: "¹ After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea\
      \ of Tiberias. \n"
    2: "² And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which\
      \ he did on them that were diseased. \n"
    3: "³ And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. \n"
    5: "⁵ When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him,\
      \ he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? \n"
    6: "⁶ And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. \n"
    7: "⁷ Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for\
      \ them, that every one of them may take a little. \n"
    8: "⁸ One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, \n"
    9: "⁹ There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes:\
      \ but what are they among so many? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the\
      \ place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed\
      \ to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise\
      \ of the fishes as much as they would. \n"
    12: "¹² When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments\
      \ that remain, that nothing be lost. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with\
      \ the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto\
      \ them that had eaten. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This\
      \ is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force,\
      \ to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it\
      \ was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they\
      \ see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were\
      \ afraid. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship\
      \ was at the land whither they went. \n"
    22: "²² The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the\
      \ sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his\
      \ disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the\
      \ boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; \n"
    23: "²³ (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where\
      \ they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) \n"
    24: "²⁴ When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples,\
      \ they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto\
      \ him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? \n"
    26: "²⁶ Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek\
      \ me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves,\
      \ and were filled. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth\
      \ unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath\
      \ God the Father sealed. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works\
      \ of God? \n"
    29: "²⁹ Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe\
      \ on him whom he hath sent. \n"
    30: "³⁰ They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may\
      \ see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? \n"
    31: "³¹ Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them\
      \ bread from heaven to eat. \n"
    32: "³² Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave\
      \ you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from\
      \ heaven. \n"
    33: "³³ For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life\
      \ unto the world. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me\
      \ shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. \n"
    36: "³⁶ But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. \n"
    37: "³⁷ All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to\
      \ me I will in no wise cast out. \n"
    38: "³⁸ For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of\
      \ him that sent me. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he\
      \ hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last\
      \ day. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the\
      \ Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him\
      \ up at the last day. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came\
      \ down from heaven. \n"
    42: "⁴² And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and\
      \ mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? \n"
    43: "⁴³ Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.\
      \ \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him:\
      \ and I will raise him up at the last day. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every\
      \ man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto\
      \ me. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath\

    47: "⁴⁷ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting\

    48: "⁴⁸ I am that bread of life. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,\

    51: "⁵¹ I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this\
      \ bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh,\

    52: "⁵² The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give\
      \ us his flesh to eat? \n"
    53: "⁵³ Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat\
      \ the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\
      \ \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I\
      \ will raise him up at the last day. \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I\
      \ in him. \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that\
      \ eateth me, even he shall live by me. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did\
      \ eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.\
      \ \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. \n"
    60: "⁶⁰ Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This\
      \ is an hard saying; who can hear it? \n"
    61: "⁶¹ When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said\
      \ unto them, Doth this offend you? \n"
    62: "⁶² What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?\
      \ \n"
    63: "⁶³ It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words\
      \ that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. \n"
    64: "⁶⁴ But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning\
      \ who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. \n"
    65: "⁶⁵ And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me,\
      \ except it were given unto him of my Father. \n"
    66: "⁶⁶ From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with\
      \ him. \n"
    67: "⁶⁷ Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? \n"
    68: "⁶⁸ Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the\
      \ words of eternal life. \n"
    69: "⁶⁹ And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the\
      \ living God. \n"
    70: "⁷⁰ Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a\
      \ devil? \n"
    71: '⁷¹ He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should
      betray him, being one of the twelve.'
  7:
    1: "¹ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry,\
      \ because the Jews sought to kill him. \n"
    2: "² Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. \n"
    3: "³ His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea,\
      \ that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. \n"
    4: "⁴ For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh\
      \ to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. \n"
    5: "⁵ For neither did his brethren believe in him. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway\
      \ ready. \n"
    7: "⁷ The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that\
      \ the works thereof are evil. \n"
    8: "⁸ Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is\
      \ not yet full come. \n"
    9: "⁹ When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast,\
      \ not openly, but as it were in secret. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? \n"
    12: "¹² And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some\
      \ said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. \n"
    13: "¹³ Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never\
      \ learned? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent\
      \ me. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it\
      \ be of God, or whether I speak of myself. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh\
      \ his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why\

    20: "²⁰ The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill\
      \ thee? \n"
    21: "²¹ Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses,\

    23: "²³ If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses\
      \ should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every\
      \ whit whole on the sabbath day? \n"
    24: "²⁴ Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to\
      \ kill? \n"
    26: "²⁶ But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers\
      \ know indeed that this is the very Christ? \n"
    27: "²⁷ Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man\
      \ knoweth whence he is. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me,\
      \ and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me\
      \ is true, whom ye know not. \n"
    29: "²⁹ But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his\
      \ hour was not yet come. \n"
    31: "³¹ And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh,\

    32: "³² The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him;\
      \ and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. \n"
    33: "³³ Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then\
      \ I go unto him that sent me. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot\
      \ come. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall\
      \ not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach\
      \ the Gentiles? \n"
    36: "³⁶ What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall\
      \ not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? \n"
    37: "³⁷ In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,\
      \ If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. \n"
    38: "³⁸ He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly\
      \ shall flow rivers of living water. \n"
    39: "³⁹ (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should\
      \ receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not\
      \ yet glorified.) \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a\
      \ truth this is the Prophet. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out\
      \ of Galilee? \n"
    42: "⁴² Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David,\
      \ and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? \n"
    43: "⁴³ So there was a division among the people because of him. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said\
      \ unto them, Why have ye not brought him? \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one\

    51: "⁵¹ Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\
      \ \n"
    52: "⁵² They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and\

    53: ⁵³ And every man went unto his own house.
  8:
    1: "¹ Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. \n"
    2: "² And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people\

    4: "⁴ They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very\
      \ act. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what\
      \ sayest thou? \n"
    6: "⁶ This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus\
      \ stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard\
      \ them not. \n"
    7: "⁷ So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them,\
      \ He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. \n"
    8: "⁸ And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. \n"
    9: "⁹ And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out\
      \ one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left\
      \ alone, and the woman standing in the midst. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said\
      \ unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn\
      \ thee: go, and sin no more. \n"
    12: "¹² Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world:\
      \ he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light\
      \ of life. \n"
    13: "¹³ The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself;\
      \ thy record is not true. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet\
      \ my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot\
      \ tell whence I come, and whither I go. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and\
      \ the Father that sent me. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth\
      \ witness of me. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither\
      \ know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father\
      \ also. \n"
    20: "²⁰ These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and\
      \ no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and\
      \ shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. \n"
    22: "²² Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I\
      \ go, ye cannot come. \n"
    23: "²³ And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of\
      \ this world; I am not of this world. \n"
    24: "²⁴ I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe\
      \ not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even\
      \ the same that I said unto you from the beginning. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is\
      \ true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. \n"
    27: "²⁷ They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then\
      \ shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father\
      \ hath taught me, I speak these things. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for\
      \ I do always those things that please him. \n"
    30: "³⁰ As he spake these words, many believed on him. \n"
    31: "³¹ Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in\
      \ my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; \n"
    32: "³² And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. \n"
    33: "³³ They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to\
      \ any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? \n"
    34: "³⁴ Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth\
      \ sin is the servant of sin. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth\
      \ ever. \n"
    36: "³⁶ If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. \n"
    37: "³⁷ I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my\
      \ word hath no place in you. \n"
    38: "³⁸ I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye\
      \ have seen with your father. \n"
    39: "³⁹ They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto\
      \ them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which\
      \ I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born\
      \ of fornication; we have one Father, even God. \n"
    42: "⁴² Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I\
      \ proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.\
      \ \n"
    43: "⁴³ Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.\
      \ \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will\
      \ do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because\
      \ there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own:\
      \ for he is a liar, and the father of it. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not\
      \ believe me? \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because\
      \ ye are not of God. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art\
      \ a Samaritan, and hast a devil? \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do\
      \ dishonour me. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\
      \ \n"
    51: "⁵¹ Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never\
      \ see death. \n"
    52: "⁵² Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham\
      \ is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall\
      \ never taste of death. \n"
    53: "⁵³ Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets\
      \ are dead: whom makest thou thyself? \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father\
      \ that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know\
      \ him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.\
      \ \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.\
      \ \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast\
      \ thou seen Abraham? \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was,\
      \ I am. \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went
      out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.'
  9:
    1: "¹ And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. \n"
    2: "² And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his\
      \ parents, that he was born blind? \n"
    3: "³ Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that\
      \ the works of God should be made manifest in him. \n"
    4: "⁴ I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh,\
      \ when no man can work. \n"
    5: "⁵ As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. \n"
    6: "⁶ When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle,\
      \ and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, \n"
    7: "⁷ And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation,\
      \ Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. \n"
    8: "⁸ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was\
      \ blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? \n"
    9: "⁹ Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? \n"
    11: "¹¹ He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed\
      \ mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went\
      \ and washed, and I received sight. \n"
    12: "¹² Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. \n"
    13: "¹³ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.\
      \ He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because\
      \ he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner\
      \ do such miracles? And there was a division among them. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath\
      \ opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and\
      \ received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received\
      \ his sight. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?\
      \ how then doth he now see? \n"
    20: "²⁰ His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and\
      \ that he was born blind: \n"
    21: "²¹ But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes,\
      \ we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. \n"
    22: "²² These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews\
      \ had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should\
      \ be put out of the synagogue. \n"
    23: "²³ Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give\
      \ God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. \n"
    25: "²⁵ He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing\
      \ I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine\
      \ eyes? \n"
    27: "²⁷ He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore\
      \ would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses'\
      \ disciples. \n"
    29: "²⁹ We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from\
      \ whence he is. \n"
    30: "³⁰ The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing,\
      \ that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. \n"
    31: "³¹ Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper\
      \ of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. \n"
    32: "³² Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of\
      \ one that was born blind. \n"
    33: "³³ If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. \n"
    34: "³⁴ They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and\
      \ dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he\
      \ said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? \n"
    36: "³⁶ He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? \n"
    37: "³⁷ And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh\
      \ with thee. \n"
    38: "³⁸ And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which\
      \ see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said\
      \ unto him, Are we blind also? \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now
      ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.'
  10:
    1: "¹ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the\
      \ sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. \n"
    3: "³ To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth\
      \ his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. \n"
    4: "⁴ And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep\
      \ follow him: for they know his voice. \n"
    5: "⁵ And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know\
      \ not the voice of strangers. \n"
    6: "⁶ This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things\
      \ they were which he spake unto them. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the\
      \ door of the sheep. \n"
    8: "⁸ All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did\
      \ not hear them. \n"
    9: "⁹ I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go\
      \ in and out, and find pasture. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I\
      \ am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep\
      \ are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the\
      \ wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. \n"
    13: "¹³ The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the\
      \ sheep. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my\
      \ life for the sheep. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring,\
      \ and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might\
      \ take it again. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to\
      \ lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received\
      \ of my Father. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? \n"
    21: "²¹ Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil\
      \ open the eyes of the blind? \n"
    22: "²² And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou\
      \ make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I\
      \ do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: \n"
    28: "²⁸ And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither\
      \ shall any man pluck them out of my hand. \n"
    29: "²⁹ My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able\
      \ to pluck them out of my Father's hand. \n"
    30: "³⁰ I and my Father are one. \n"
    31: "³¹ Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. \n"
    32: "³² Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father;\
      \ for which of those works do ye stone me? \n"
    33: "³³ The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but\
      \ for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\
      \ \n"
    35: "³⁵ If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture\
      \ cannot be broken; \n"
    36: "³⁶ Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world,\
      \ Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? \n"
    37: "³⁷ If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. \n"
    38: "³⁸ But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may\
      \ know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,\
      \ \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized;\
      \ and there he abode. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things\
      \ that John spake of this man were true. \n"
    42: ⁴² And many believed on him there.
  11:
    1: "¹ Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary\
      \ and her sister Martha. \n"
    2: "² (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet\
      \ with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) \n"
    3: "³ Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou\
      \ lovest is sick. \n"
    4: "⁴ When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for\
      \ the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. \n"
    6: "⁶ When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in\
      \ the same place where he was. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee;\
      \ and goest thou thither again? \n"
    9: "⁹ Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in\
      \ the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light\
      \ in him. \n"
    11: "¹¹ These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus\
      \ sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. \n"
    12: "¹² Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. \n"
    13: "¹³ Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken\
      \ of taking of rest in sleep. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may\
      \ believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let\
      \ us also go, that we may die with him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days\
      \ already. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning\
      \ their brother. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met\
      \ him: but Mary sat still in the house. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother\
      \ had not died. \n"
    22: "²² But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give\
      \ it thee. \n"
    23: "²³ Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection\
      \ at the last day. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth\
      \ in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: \n"
    26: "²⁶ And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou\
      \ this? \n"
    27: "²⁷ She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the\
      \ Son of God, which should come into the world. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister\
      \ secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. \n"
    29: "²⁹ As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where\
      \ Martha met him. \n"
    31: "³¹ The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when\
      \ they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying,\
      \ She goeth unto the grave to weep there. \n"
    32: "³² Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at\
      \ his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not\
      \ died. \n"
    33: "³³ When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which\
      \ came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. \n"
    34: "³⁴ And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.\
      \ \n"
    35: "³⁵ Jesus wept. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! \n"
    37: "³⁷ And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the\
      \ blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? \n"
    38: "³⁸ Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was\
      \ a cave, and a stone lay upon it. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was\
      \ dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead\
      \ four days. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe,\
      \ thou shouldest see the glory of God? \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.\
      \ And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast\
      \ heard me. \n"
    42: "⁴² And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which\
      \ stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. \n"
    43: "⁴³ And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come\
      \ forth. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes:\
      \ and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him,\
      \ and let him go. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which\
      \ Jesus did, believed on him. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what\
      \ things Jesus had done. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said,\
      \ What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans\
      \ shall come and take away both our place and nation. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year,\
      \ said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for\
      \ the people, and that the whole nation perish not. \n"
    51: "⁵¹ And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he\
      \ prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; \n"
    52: "⁵² And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together\
      \ in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. \n"
    53: "⁵³ Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to\
      \ death. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence\
      \ unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there\
      \ continued with his disciples. \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country\
      \ up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood\
      \ in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? \n"
    57: ⁵⁷ Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that,
      if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
  12:
    1: "¹ Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was,\
      \ which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. \n"
    2: "² There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of\
      \ them that sat at the table with him. \n"
    3: "³ Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed\
      \ the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled\
      \ with the odour of the ointment. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should\
      \ betray him, \n"
    5: "⁵ Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the\
      \ poor? \n"
    6: "⁶ This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief,\
      \ and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept\
      \ this. \n"
    8: "⁸ For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. \n"
    9: "⁹ Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came\
      \ not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had\
      \ raised from the dead. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed\
      \ on Jesus. \n"
    12: "¹² On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard\
      \ that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, \n"
    13: "¹³ Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna:\
      \ Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's\
      \ colt. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus\
      \ was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him,\
      \ and that they had done these things unto him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his\
      \ grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had\
      \ done this miracle. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail\
      \ nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the\
      \ feast: \n"
    21: "²¹ The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee,\
      \ and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. \n"
    22: "²² Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man\
      \ should be glorified. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground\
      \ and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. \n"
    25: "²⁵ He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in\
      \ this world shall keep it unto life eternal. \n"
    26: "²⁶ If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also\
      \ my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this\
      \ hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying,\
      \ I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. \n"
    29: "²⁹ The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered:\
      \ others said, An angel spake to him. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your\
      \ sakes. \n"
    31: "³¹ Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world\
      \ be cast out. \n"
    32: "³² And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. \n"
    33: "³³ This he said, signifying what death he should die. \n"
    34: "³⁴ The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth\
      \ for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this\
      \ Son of man? \n"
    35: "³⁵ Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk\
      \ while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh\
      \ in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. \n"
    36: "³⁶ While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children\
      \ of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from\
      \ them. \n"
    37: "³⁷ But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed\
      \ not on him: \n"
    38: "³⁸ That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,\
      \ Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been\
      \ revealed? \n"
    39: "³⁹ Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should\
      \ not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,\
      \ and I should heal them. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. \n"
    42: "⁴² Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because\
      \ of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of\
      \ the synagogue: \n"
    43: "⁴³ For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but\
      \ on him that sent me. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should\
      \ not abide in darkness. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I\
      \ came not to judge the world, but to save the world. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth\
      \ him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.\
      \ \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave\
      \ me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak
      therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.'
  13:
    1: "¹ Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was\
      \ come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved\
      \ his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. \n"
    2: "² And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas\
      \ Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; \n"
    3: "³ Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that\
      \ he was come from God, and went to God; \n"
    4: "⁴ He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and\
      \ girded himself. \n"
    5: "⁵ After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples'\
      \ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou\
      \ wash my feet? \n"
    7: "⁷ Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou\
      \ shalt know hereafter. \n"
    8: "⁸ Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him,\
      \ If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. \n"
    9: "⁹ Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and\
      \ my head. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet,\
      \ but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was\
      \ set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? \n"
    13: "¹³ Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought\
      \ to wash one another's feet. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord;\
      \ neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture\
      \ may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against\
      \ me. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe\
      \ that I am he. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth\
      \ me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. \n"
    21: "²¹ When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and\
      \ said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. \n"
    22: "²² Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. \n"
    23: "²³ Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus\
      \ loved. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should\
      \ be of whom he spake. \n"
    25: "²⁵ He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? \n"
    26: "²⁶ Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped\
      \ it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son\
      \ of Simon. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That\
      \ thou doest, do quickly. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said\
      \ unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that\
      \ he should give something to the poor. \n"
    30: "³⁰ He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified,\
      \ and God is glorified in him. \n"
    32: "³² If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and\
      \ shall straightway glorify him. \n"
    33: "³³ Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and\
      \ as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have\
      \ loved you, that ye also love one another. \n"
    35: "³⁵ By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one\
      \ to another. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him,\
      \ Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.\
      \ \n"
    37: "³⁷ Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down\
      \ my life for thy sake. \n"
    38: ³⁸ Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily,
      I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
  14:
    1: "¹ Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. \n"
    2: "² In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have\
      \ told you. I go to prepare a place for you. \n"
    3: "³ And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive\
      \ you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. \n"
    4: "⁴ And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can\
      \ we know the way? \n"
    6: "⁶ Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh\
      \ unto the Father, but by me. \n"
    7: "⁷ If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth\
      \ ye know him, and have seen him. \n"
    8: "⁸ Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. \n"
    9: "⁹ Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou\
      \ not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest\
      \ thou then, Show us the Father? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the\
      \ words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth\
      \ in me, he doeth the works. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe\
      \ me for the very works' sake. \n"
    12: "¹² Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that\
      \ I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I\
      \ go unto my Father. \n"
    13: "¹³ And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father\
      \ may be glorified in the Son. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ If ye love me, keep my commandments. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that\
      \ he may abide with you for ever; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth\
      \ him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and\
      \ shall be in you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because\
      \ I live, ye shall live also. \n"
    20: "²⁰ At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I\
      \ in you. \n"
    21: "²¹ He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:\
      \ and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and\
      \ will manifest myself to him. \n"
    22: "²² Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest\
      \ thyself unto us, and not unto the world? \n"
    23: "²³ Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words:\
      \ and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode\
      \ with him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear\
      \ is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. \n"
    25: "²⁵ These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send\
      \ in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,\
      \ whatsoever I have said unto you. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth,\
      \ give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you.\
      \ If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for\
      \ my Father is greater than I. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come\
      \ to pass, ye might believe. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world\

    31: ³¹ But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave
      me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
  15:
    1: "¹ I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. \n"
    2: "² Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch\
      \ that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. \n"
    3: "³ Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. \n"
    4: "⁴ Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except\
      \ it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. \n"
    5: "⁵ I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him,\

    14: "¹⁴ Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his\

    16: "¹⁶ Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\
      \ should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever\
      \ ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ These things I command you, that ye love one another. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye\
      \ are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the\
      \ world hateth you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than\
      \ his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they\
      \ have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. \n"
    21: "²¹ But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because\
      \ they know not him that sent me. \n"
    22: "²² If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now\
      \ they have no cloak for their sin. \n"
    23: "²³ He that hateth me hateth my Father also. \n"
    24: "²⁴ If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they\
      \ had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written\
      \ in their law, They hated me without a cause. \n"
    26: "²⁶ But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,\
      \ even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify\
      \ of me: \n"
    27: ²⁷ And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
  16:
    1: "¹ These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. \n"
    2: "² They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever\
      \ killeth you will think that he doeth God service. \n"
    3: "³ And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the\
      \ Father, nor me. \n"
    4: "⁴ But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may\
      \ remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at\
      \ the beginning, because I was with you. \n"
    5: "⁵ But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither\
      \ goest thou? \n"
    6: "⁶ But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away:\
      \ for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart,\
      \ I will send him unto you. \n"
    8: "⁸ And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness,\
      \ and of judgment: \n"
    9: "⁹ Of sin, because they believe not on me; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; \n"
    11: "¹¹ Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. \n"
    12: "¹² I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. \n"
    13: "¹³ Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into\
      \ all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,\
      \ that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto\
      \ you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall\
      \ take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and\
      \ ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he\
      \ saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little\
      \ while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot\
      \ tell what he saith. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them,\
      \ Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall\
      \ not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? \n"
    20: "²⁰ Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the\
      \ world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned\
      \ into joy. \n"
    21: "²¹ A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come:\
      \ but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the\
      \ anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. \n"
    22: "²² And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart\
      \ shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. \n"
    23: "²³ And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you,\
      \ Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive,\
      \ that your joy may be full. \n"
    25: "²⁵ These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh,\
      \ when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly\
      \ of the Father. \n"
    26: "²⁶ At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will\
      \ pray the Father for you: \n"
    27: "²⁷ For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have\
      \ believed that I came out from God. \n"
    28: "²⁸ I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave\
      \ the world, and go to the Father. \n"
    29: "²⁹ His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest\
      \ no proverb. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any\
      \ man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. \n"
    31: "³¹ Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? \n"
    32: "³² Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered,\
      \ every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because\
      \ the Father is with me. \n"
    33: '³³ These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In
      the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
      world.'
  17:
    1: "¹ These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father,\
      \ the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: \n"
    2: "² As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal\
      \ life to as many as thou hast given him. \n"
    3: "³ And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and\
      \ Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. \n"
    4: "⁴ I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou\
      \ gavest me to do. \n"
    5: "⁵ And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which\
      \ I had with thee before the world was. \n"
    6: "⁶ I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the\
      \ world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of\
      \ thee. \n"
    8: "⁸ For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have\
      \ received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have\
      \ believed that thou didst send me. \n"
    9: "⁹ I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast\
      \ given me; for they are thine. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come\
      \ to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given\
      \ me, that they may be one, as we are. \n"
    12: "¹² While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that\
      \ thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition;\
      \ that the scripture might be fulfilled. \n"
    13: "¹³ And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they\
      \ might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they\
      \ are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou\
      \ shouldest keep them from the evil. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into\
      \ the world. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified\
      \ through the truth. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe\
      \ on me through their word; \n"
    21: "²¹ That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that\
      \ they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent\
      \ me. \n"
    22: "²² And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be\
      \ one, even as we are one: \n"
    23: "²³ I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that\
      \ the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast\
      \ loved me. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where\
      \ I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst\
      \ me before the foundation of the world. \n"
    25: "²⁵ O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee,\
      \ and these have known that thou hast sent me. \n"
    26: '²⁶ And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the
      love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.'
  18:
    1: "¹ When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over\
      \ the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted\
      \ thither with his disciples. \n"
    3: "³ Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests\
      \ and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. \n"
    4: "⁴ Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth,\
      \ and said unto them, Whom seek ye? \n"
    5: "⁵ They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And\
      \ Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. \n"
    6: "⁶ As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and\
      \ fell to the ground. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let\
      \ these go their way: \n"
    9: "⁹ That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest\
      \ me have I lost none. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant,\
      \ and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup\
      \ which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? \n"
    12: "¹² Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and\
      \ bound him, \n"
    13: "¹³ And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas,\
      \ which was the high priest that same year. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient\
      \ that one man should die for the people. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple\
      \ was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of\
      \ the high priest. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple,\
      \ which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door,\
      \ and brought in Peter. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also\
      \ one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals;\
      \ for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and\
      \ warmed himself. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the\
      \ synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret\
      \ have I said nothing. \n"
    21: "²¹ Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them:\
      \ behold, they know what I said. \n"
    22: "²² And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck\
      \ Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but\
      \ if well, why smitest thou me? \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him,\
      \ Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter\
      \ cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? \n"
    27: "²⁷ Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was\
      \ early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should\
      \ be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against\
      \ this man? \n"
    30: "³⁰ They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would\
      \ not have delivered him up unto thee. \n"
    31: "³¹ Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your\
      \ law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any\
      \ man to death: \n"
    32: "³² That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying\
      \ what death he should die. \n"
    33: "³³ Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and\
      \ said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? \n"
    34: "³⁴ Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell\
      \ it thee of me? \n"
    35: "³⁵ Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have\
      \ delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? \n"
    36: "³⁶ Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of\
      \ this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to\
      \ the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered,\
      \ Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came\
      \ I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that\
      \ is of the truth heareth my voice. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went\
      \ out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.\
      \ \n"
    39: "³⁹ But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover:\
      \ will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? \n"
    40: ⁴⁰ Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas
      was a robber.
  19:
    1: "¹ Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. \n"
    2: "² And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and\
      \ they put on him a purple robe, \n"
    3: "³ And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. \n"
    4: "⁴ Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring\
      \ him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.\
      \ And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! \n"
    6: "⁶ When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying,\
      \ Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify\
      \ him: for I find no fault in him. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because\
      \ he made himself the Son of God. \n"
    8: "⁸ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; \n"
    9: "⁹ And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art\
      \ thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not\
      \ that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? \n"
    11: "¹¹ Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except\
      \ it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath\
      \ the greater sin. \n"
    12: "¹² And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried\
      \ out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever\
      \ maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. \n"
    13: "¹³ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat\
      \ down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the\
      \ Hebrew, Gabbatha. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour:\
      \ and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate\
      \ saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We\
      \ have no king but Caesar. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took\
      \ Jesus, and led him away. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a\
      \ skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one,\
      \ and Jesus in the midst. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was\
      \ Jesus Of Nazareth The King Of The Jews. \n"
    20: "²⁰ This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified\
      \ was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King\
      \ of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. \n"
    22: "²² Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. \n"
    23: "²³ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and\
      \ made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat\
      \ was without seam, woven from the top throughout. \n"
    24: "²⁴ They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots\
      \ for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,\
      \ They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.\
      \ These things therefore the soldiers did. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,\
      \ Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. \n"
    26: "²⁶ When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom\
      \ he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that\
      \ disciple took her unto his own home. \n"
    28: "²⁸ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that\
      \ the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with\
      \ vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. \n"
    30: "³⁰ When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished:\
      \ and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. \n"
    31: "³¹ The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should\
      \ not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an\
      \ high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they\
      \ might be taken away. \n"
    32: "³² Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other\
      \ which was crucified with him. \n"
    33: "³³ But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake\
      \ not his legs: \n"
    34: "³⁴ But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came\
      \ there out blood and water. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth\
      \ that he saith true, that ye might believe. \n"
    36: "³⁶ For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A\
      \ bone of him shall not be broken. \n"
    37: "³⁷ And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.\
      \ \n"
    38: "³⁸ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly\
      \ for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of\
      \ Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of\
      \ Jesus. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night,\
      \ and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the\
      \ spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the\
      \ garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. \n"
    42: ⁴² There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for
      the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
  20:
    1: "¹ The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark,\
      \ unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. \n"
    2: "² Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple,\
      \ whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of\
      \ the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. \n"
    3: "³ Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and\
      \ came first to the sepulchre. \n"
    5: "⁵ And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went\
      \ he not in. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and\
      \ seeth the linen clothes lie, \n"
    7: "⁷ And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes,\
      \ but wrapped together in a place by itself. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre,\
      \ and he saw, and believed. \n"
    9: "⁹ For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the\
      \ dead. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she\
      \ stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, \n"
    12: "¹² And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other\
      \ at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. \n"
    13: "¹³ And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because\
      \ they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing,\
      \ and knew not that it was Jesus. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,\
      \ supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne\
      \ him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni;\
      \ which is to say, Master. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:\
      \ but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your\
      \ Father; and to my God, and your God. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,\
      \ and that he had spoken these things unto her. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the\
      \ doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came\
      \ Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then\
      \ were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent\
      \ me, even so send I you. \n"
    22: "²² And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive\
      \ ye the Holy Ghost: \n"
    23: "²³ Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever\
      \ sins ye retain, they are retained. \n"
    24: "²⁴ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when\
      \ Jesus came. \n"
    25: "²⁵ The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But\
      \ he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails,\
      \ and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his\
      \ side, I will not believe. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with\
      \ them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,\
      \ Peace be unto you. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands;\
      \ and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless,\
      \ but believing. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:\
      \ blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples,\
      \ which are not written in this book: \n"
    31: ³¹ But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
      the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
  21:
    1: "¹ After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea\
      \ of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. \n"
    2: "² There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael\
      \ of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also\
      \ go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that\
      \ night they caught nothing. \n"
    4: "⁴ But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples\
      \ knew not that it was Jesus. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him,\
      \ No. \n"
    6: "⁶ And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye\
      \ shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for\
      \ the multitude of fishes. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.\
      \ Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat\
      \ unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from\
      \ land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. \n"
    9: "⁹ As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there,\
      \ and fish laid thereon, and bread. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an\
      \ hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the\
      \ net broken. \n"
    12: "¹² Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst\
      \ ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples,\
      \ after that he was risen from the dead. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas,\
      \ lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest\
      \ that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou\
      \ me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith\
      \ unto him, Feed my sheep. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?\
      \ Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?\
      \ And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love\
      \ thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself,\
      \ and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt\
      \ stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither\
      \ thou wouldest not. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when\
      \ he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following;\
      \ which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that\
      \ betrayeth thee? \n"
    21: "²¹ Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? \n"
    22: "²² Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that\
      \ to thee? follow thou me. \n"
    23: "²³ Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should\
      \ not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that\
      \ he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? \n"
    24: "²⁴ This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these\
      \ things: and we know that his testimony is true. \n"
    25: ²⁵ And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they
      should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not
      contain the books that should be written. Amen.
