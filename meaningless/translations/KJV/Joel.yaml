Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. \n"
    2: "² Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath\
      \ this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? \n"
    3: "³ Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children,\
      \ and their children another generation. \n"
    4: "⁴ That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which\
      \ the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm\
      \ hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. \n"
    5: "⁵ Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because\
      \ of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. \n"
    6: "⁶ For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose\
      \ teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean\
      \ bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. \n"
    8: "⁸ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the\
      \ Lord; the priests, the Lord's ministers, mourn. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new\
      \ wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat\
      \ and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. \n"
    12: "¹² The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree,\
      \ the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are\
      \ withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. \n"
    13: "¹³ Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar:\
      \ come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering\
      \ and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all\
      \ the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto\
      \ the Lord, \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction\
      \ from the Almighty shall it come. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the\
      \ house of our God? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the\
      \ barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they\
      \ have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ O Lord, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of\
      \ the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are
      dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.'
  2:
    1: "¹ Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let\
      \ all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for\
      \ it is nigh at hand; \n"
    2: "² A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness,\
      \ as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there\
      \ hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the\
      \ years of many generations. \n"
    3: "³ A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land\
      \ is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness;\
      \ yea, and nothing shall escape them. \n"
    4: "⁴ The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen,\
      \ so shall they run. \n"
    5: "⁵ Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like\
      \ the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people\
      \ set in battle array. \n"
    6: "⁶ Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather\
      \ blackness. \n"
    7: "⁷ They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war;\
      \ and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their\
      \ ranks: \n"
    8: "⁸ Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path:\
      \ and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. \n"
    9: "⁹ They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they\
      \ shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a\
      \ thief. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun\
      \ and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very\
      \ great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is\
      \ great and very terrible; and who can abide it? \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart,\
      \ and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: \n"
    13: "¹³ And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your\
      \ God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,\
      \ and repenteth him of the evil. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind\
      \ him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather\
      \ the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth\
      \ of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and\
      \ the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine\
      \ heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should\
      \ they say among the people, Where is their God? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send\
      \ you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will\
      \ no more make you a reproach among the heathen: \n"
    20: "²⁰ But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him\
      \ into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his\
      \ hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill\
      \ savour shall come up, because he hath done great things. \n"
    21: "²¹ Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness\
      \ do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield\
      \ their strength. \n"
    23: "²³ Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for\
      \ he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down\
      \ for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with\
      \ wine and oil. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm,\
      \ and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among\
      \ you. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the\
      \ Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never\
      \ be ashamed. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the\
      \ Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon\
      \ all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall\
      \ dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: \n"
    29: "²⁹ And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I\
      \ pour out my spirit. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire,\
      \ and pillars of smoke. \n"
    31: "³¹ The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before\
      \ the great and terrible day of the Lord come. \n"
    32: '³² And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the
      Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance,
      as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.'
  3:
    1: "¹ For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the\
      \ captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, \n"
    2: "² I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley\
      \ of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage\
      \ Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. \n"
    3: "³ And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot,\
      \ and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. \n"
    4: "⁴ Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts\
      \ of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly\
      \ and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head; \n"
    5: "⁵ Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your\
      \ temples my goodly pleasant things: \n"
    6: "⁶ The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto\
      \ the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. \n"
    7: "⁷ Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and\
      \ will return your recompence upon your own head: \n"
    8: "⁸ And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children\
      \ of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for\
      \ the Lord hath spoken it. \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men,\
      \ let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let\
      \ the weak say, I am strong. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together\
      \ round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:\
      \ for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. \n"
    13: "¹³ Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for\
      \ the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord\
      \ is near in the valley of decision. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their\
      \ shining. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem;\
      \ and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of\
      \ his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my holy\
      \ mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass\
      \ through her any more. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down\
      \ new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah\
      \ shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of\
      \ the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,\
      \ for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent\
      \ blood in their land. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord
      dwelleth in Zion.'
