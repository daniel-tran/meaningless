Romans:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto\
      \ the gospel of God, \n"
    2: "² (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) \n"
    3: "³ Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of\
      \ David according to the flesh; \n"
    4: "⁴ And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of\
      \ holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: \n"
    5: "⁵ By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith\
      \ among all nations, for his name: \n"
    6: "⁶ Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: \n"
    7: "⁷ To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you\
      \ and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    8: "⁸ First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith\
      \ is spoken of throughout the whole world. \n"
    9: "⁹ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his\
      \ Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous\
      \ journey by the will of God to come unto you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift,\
      \ to the end ye may be established; \n"
    12: "¹² That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith\
      \ both of you and me. \n"
    13: "¹³ Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed\
      \ to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among\
      \ you also, even as among other Gentiles. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise,\
      \ and to the unwise. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are\
      \ at Rome also. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God\
      \ unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to\
      \ the Greek. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith:\
      \ as it is written, The just shall live by faith. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and\
      \ unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath\
      \ shewed it unto them. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly\
      \ seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power\
      \ and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: \n"
    21: "²¹ Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither\
      \ were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart\
      \ was darkened. \n"
    22: "²² Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, \n"
    23: "²³ And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like\
      \ to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their\
      \ own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: \n"
    25: "²⁵ Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the\
      \ creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women\
      \ did change the natural use into that which is against nature: \n"
    27: "²⁷ And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned\
      \ in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly,\
      \ and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave\
      \ them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,\
      \ maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil\
      \ things, disobedient to parents, \n"
    31: "³¹ Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable,\
      \ unmerciful: \n"
    32: ³² Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are
      worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
  2:
    1: "¹ Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest:\
      \ for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest\
      \ doest the same things. \n"
    2: "² But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them\
      \ which commit such things. \n"
    3: "³ And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and\
      \ doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? \n"
    4: "⁴ Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering;\
      \ not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? \n"
    5: "⁵ But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath\
      \ against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Who will render to every man according to his deeds: \n"
    7: "⁷ To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour\
      \ and immortality, eternal life: \n"
    8: "⁸ But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey\
      \ unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, \n"
    9: "⁹ Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the\
      \ Jew first, and also of the Gentile; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew\
      \ first, and also to the Gentile: \n"
    11: "¹¹ For there is no respect of persons with God. \n"
    12: "¹² For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law:\
      \ and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; \n"
    13: "¹³ (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of\
      \ the law shall be justified. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things\
      \ contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience\
      \ also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing\
      \ one another;) \n"
    16: "¹⁶ In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according\
      \ to my gospel. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy\
      \ boast of God, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent,\
      \ being instructed out of the law; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light\
      \ of them which are in darkness, \n"
    20: "²⁰ An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form\
      \ of knowledge and of the truth in the law. \n"
    21: "²¹ Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou\
      \ that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? \n"
    22: "²² Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?\
      \ thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? \n"
    23: "²³ Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest\
      \ thou God? \n"
    24: "²⁴ For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it\
      \ is written. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be\
      \ a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall\
      \ not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? \n"
    27: "²⁷ And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law,\
      \ judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? \n"
    28: "²⁸ For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision,\
      \ which is outward in the flesh: \n"
    29: ²⁹ But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the
      heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but
      of God.
  3:
    1: "¹ What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles\
      \ of God. \n"
    3: "³ For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of\
      \ God without effect? \n"
    4: "⁴ God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written,\
      \ That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when\
      \ thou art judged. \n"
    5: "⁵ But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall\
      \ we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) \n"
    6: "⁶ God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? \n"
    7: "⁷ For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory;\
      \ why yet am I also judged as a sinner? \n"
    8: "⁸ And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that\
      \ we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. \n"
    9: "⁹ What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved\
      \ both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: \n"
    11: "¹¹ There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;\
      \ there is none that doeth good, no, not one. \n"
    13: "¹³ Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit;\
      \ the poison of asps is under their lips: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Their feet are swift to shed blood: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Destruction and misery are in their ways: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the way of peace have they not known: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ There is no fear of God before their eyes. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who\
      \ are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may\
      \ become guilty before God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in\
      \ his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. \n"
    21: "²¹ But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being\
      \ witnessed by the law and the prophets; \n"
    22: "²² Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all\
      \ and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: \n"
    23: "²³ For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; \n"
    24: "²⁴ Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in\
      \ Christ Jesus: \n"
    25: "²⁵ Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,\
      \ to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through\
      \ the forbearance of God; \n"
    26: "²⁶ To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just,\
      \ and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but\
      \ by the law of faith. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds\
      \ of the law. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of\
      \ the Gentiles also: \n"
    30: "³⁰ Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and\
      \ uncircumcision through faith. \n"
    31: '³¹ Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish
      the law.'
  4:
    1: "¹ What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh,\
      \ hath found? \n"
    2: "² For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not\
      \ before God. \n"
    3: "³ For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto\
      \ him for righteousness. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly,\
      \ his faith is counted for righteousness. \n"
    6: "⁶ Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God\
      \ imputeth righteousness without works, \n"
    7: "⁷ Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are\
      \ covered. \n"
    8: "⁸ Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. \n"
    9: "⁹ Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision\
      \ also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?\
      \ Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness\
      \ of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father\
      \ of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness\
      \ might be imputed unto them also: \n"
    12: "¹² And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision\
      \ only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham,\
      \ which he had being yet uncircumcised. \n"
    13: "¹³ For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham,\
      \ or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the\
      \ promise made of none effect: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise\
      \ might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to\
      \ that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before\
      \ him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those\
      \ things which be not as though they were. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of\
      \ many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead,\
      \ when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's\
      \ womb: \n"
    20: "²⁰ He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong\
      \ in faith, giving glory to God; \n"
    21: "²¹ And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also\
      \ to perform. \n"
    22: "²² And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. \n"
    23: "²³ Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that\
      \ raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; \n"
    25: ²⁵ Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
  5:
    1: "¹ Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ: \n"
    2: "² By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and\
      \ rejoice in hope of the glory of God. \n"
    3: "³ And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation\
      \ worketh patience; \n"
    4: "⁴ And patience, experience; and experience, hope: \n"
    5: "⁵ And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our\
      \ hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. \n"
    6: "⁶ For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good\
      \ man some would even dare to die. \n"
    8: "⁸ But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,\
      \ Christ died for us. \n"
    9: "⁹ Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from\
      \ wrath through him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of\
      \ his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\
      \ by whom we have now received the atonement. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;\
      \ and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: \n"
    13: "¹³ (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there\
      \ is no law. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had\
      \ not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure\
      \ of him that was to come. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence\
      \ of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which\
      \ is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment\
      \ was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which\
      \ receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in\
      \ life by one, Jesus Christ.) \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation;\
      \ even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification\
      \ of life. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience\
      \ of one shall many be made righteous. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin\
      \ abounded, grace did much more abound: \n"
    21: ²¹ That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
      righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
  6:
    1: "¹ What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?\
      \ \n"
    2: "² God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were\
      \ baptized into his death? \n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ\
      \ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should\
      \ walk in newness of life. \n"
    5: "⁵ For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall\
      \ be also in the likeness of his resurrection: \n"
    6: "⁶ Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin\
      \ might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. \n"
    7: "⁷ For he that is dead is freed from sin. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath\
      \ no more dominion over him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he\
      \ liveth unto God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive\
      \ unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it\
      \ in the lusts thereof. \n"
    13: "¹³ Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin:\
      \ but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and\
      \ your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law,\
      \ but under grace. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?\
      \ God forbid. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants\
      \ ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed\
      \ from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh:\
      \ for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity\
      \ unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto\
      \ holiness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for\
      \ the end of those things is death. \n"
    22: "²² But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have\
      \ your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. \n"
    23: ²³ For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
      Jesus Christ our Lord.
  7:
    1: "¹ Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that\
      \ the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? \n"
    2: "² For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so\
      \ long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law\
      \ of her husband. \n"
    3: "³ So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she\
      \ shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from\
      \ that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of\
      \ Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from\
      \ the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. \n"
    5: "⁵ For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law,\
      \ did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. \n"
    6: "⁶ But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held;\
      \ that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known\
      \ sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou\
      \ shalt not covet. \n"
    8: "⁸ But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of\
      \ concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. \n"
    9: "⁹ For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin\
      \ revived, and I died. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew\
      \ me. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that\
      \ it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by\
      \ the commandment might become exceeding sinful. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but\
      \ what I hate, that do I. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is\
      \ good. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing:\
      \ for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find\
      \ not. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that\
      \ I do. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that\
      \ dwelleth in me. \n"
    21: "²¹ I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: \n"
    23: "²³ But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,\
      \ and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. \n"
    24: "²⁴ O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\
      \ \n"
    25: ²⁵ I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself
      serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
  8:
    1: "¹ There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,\
      \ who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. \n"
    2: "² For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from\
      \ the law of sin and death. \n"
    3: "³ For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God\
      \ sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned\
      \ sin in the flesh: \n"
    4: "⁴ That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not\
      \ after the flesh, but after the Spirit. \n"
    5: "⁵ For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they\
      \ that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. \n"
    6: "⁶ For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life\
      \ and peace. \n"
    7: "⁷ Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to\
      \ the law of God, neither indeed can be. \n"
    8: "⁸ So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. \n"
    9: "⁹ But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit\
      \ of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none\
      \ of his. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit\
      \ is life because of righteousness. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,\
      \ he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies\
      \ by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the\
      \ flesh. \n"
    13: "¹³ For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit\
      \ do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have\
      \ received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children\
      \ of God: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ;\
      \ if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to\
      \ be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation\
      \ of the sons of God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason\
      \ of him who hath subjected the same in hope, \n"
    21: "²¹ Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of\
      \ corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. \n"
    22: "²² For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together\
      \ until now. \n"
    23: "²³ And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the\
      \ Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,\
      \ to wit, the redemption of our body. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what\
      \ a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? \n"
    25: "²⁵ But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for\
      \ it. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what\
      \ we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession\
      \ for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,\
      \ because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,\
      \ to them who are the called according to his purpose. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to\
      \ the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called,\
      \ them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. \n"
    31: "³¹ What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against\
      \ us? \n"
    32: "³² He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall\
      \ he not with him also freely give us all things? \n"
    33: "³³ Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is\
      \ risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession\
      \ for us. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,\
      \ or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? \n"
    36: "³⁶ As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are\
      \ accounted as sheep for the slaughter. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that\
      \ loved us. \n"
    38: "³⁸ For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,\
      \ nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, \n"
    39: ³⁹ Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
      us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
  9:
    1: "¹ I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness\
      \ in the Holy Ghost, \n"
    2: "² That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. \n"
    3: "³ For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren,\
      \ my kinsmen according to the flesh: \n"
    4: "⁴ Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and\
      \ the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the\
      \ promises; \n"
    5: "⁵ Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came,\
      \ who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. \n"
    6: "⁶ Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all\
      \ Israel, which are of Israel: \n"
    7: "⁷ Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but,\
      \ In Isaac shall thy seed be called. \n"
    8: "⁸ That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children\
      \ of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. \n"
    9: "⁹ For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall\
      \ have a son. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by\
      \ our father Isaac; \n"
    11: "¹¹ (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or\
      \ evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works,\
      \ but of him that calleth;) \n"
    12: "¹² It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. \n"
    13: "¹³ As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and\
      \ I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of\
      \ God that sheweth mercy. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have\
      \ I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might\
      \ be declared throughout all the earth. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he\
      \ hardeneth. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted\
      \ his will? \n"
    20: "²⁰ Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing\
      \ formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? \n"
    21: "²¹ Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one\
      \ vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? \n"
    22: "²² What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured\
      \ with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: \n"
    23: "²³ And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of\
      \ mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, \n"
    24: "²⁴ Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my\
      \ people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them,\
      \ Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living\
      \ God. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children\
      \ of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: \n"
    28: "²⁸ For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because\
      \ a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,\
      \ we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. \n"
    30: "³⁰ What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness,\
      \ have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained\
      \ to the law of righteousness. \n"
    32: "³² Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the\
      \ works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; \n"
    33: '³³ As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence:
      and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.'
  10:
    1: "¹ Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might\
      \ be saved. \n"
    2: "² For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to\
      \ knowledge. \n"
    3: "³ For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish\
      \ their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness\
      \ of God. \n"
    4: "⁴ For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man\
      \ which doeth those things shall live by them. \n"
    6: "⁶ But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in\
      \ thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down\
      \ from above:) \n"
    7: "⁷ Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again\
      \ from the dead.) \n"
    8: "⁸ But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy\
      \ heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; \n"
    9: "⁹ That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe\
      \ in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth\
      \ confession is made unto salvation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same\
      \ Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. \n"
    13: "¹³ For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how\
      \ shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they\
      \ hear without a preacher? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How\
      \ beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring\
      \ glad tidings of good things! \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath\
      \ believed our report? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all\
      \ the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you\
      \ to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger\
      \ you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me\
      \ not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. \n"
    21: ²¹ But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto
      a disobedient and gainsaying people.
  11:
    1: "¹ I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an\
      \ Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. \n"
    2: "² God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the\
      \ scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel\
      \ saying, \n"
    3: "³ Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I\
      \ am left alone, and they seek my life. \n"
    4: "⁴ But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven\
      \ thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. \n"
    5: "⁵ Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the\
      \ election of grace. \n"
    6: "⁶ And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more\
      \ grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is\
      \ no more work. \n"
    7: "⁷ What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election\
      \ hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. \n"
    8: "⁸ (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber,\
      \ eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this\
      \ day. \n"
    9: "⁹ And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock,\
      \ and a recompence unto them: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their\
      \ back alway. \n"
    11: "¹¹ I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but\
      \ rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke\
      \ them to jealousy. \n"
    12: "¹² Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing\
      \ of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? \n"
    13: "¹³ For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles,\
      \ I magnify mine office: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and\
      \ might save some of them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what\
      \ shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root\
      \ be holy, so are the branches. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive\
      \ tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and\
      \ fatness of the olive tree; \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the\
      \ root, but the root thee. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted\
      \ in. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.\
      \ Be not highminded, but fear: \n"
    21: "²¹ For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare\
      \ not thee. \n"
    22: "²² Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,\
      \ severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise\
      \ thou also shalt be cut off. \n"
    23: "²³ And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in:\
      \ for God is able to graft them in again. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and\
      \ wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall\
      \ these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,\
      \ lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened\
      \ to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out\
      \ of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: \n"
    27: "²⁷ For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching\
      \ the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. \n"
    30: "³⁰ For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy\
      \ through their unbelief: \n"
    31: "³¹ Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they\
      \ also may obtain mercy. \n"
    32: "³² For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy\
      \ upon all. \n"
    33: "³³ O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how\
      \ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! \n"
    34: "³⁴ For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?\
      \ \n"
    35: "³⁵ Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?\
      \ \n"
    36: '³⁶ For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory
      for ever. Amen.'
  12:
    1: "¹ I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present\
      \ your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable\
      \ service. \n"
    2: "² And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing\
      \ of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect,\
      \ will of God. \n"
    3: "³ For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you,\
      \ not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly,\
      \ according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. \n"
    4: "⁴ For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same\
      \ office: \n"
    5: "⁵ So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of\
      \ another. \n"
    6: "⁶ Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us,\
      \ whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; \n"
    7: "⁷ Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with\
      \ simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that\
      \ which is good. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring\
      \ one another; \n"
    11: "¹¹ Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; \n"
    12: "¹² Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend\
      \ to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight\
      \ of all men. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath:\
      \ for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink:\
      \ for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. \n"
    21: ²¹ Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
  13:
    1: "¹ Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power\
      \ but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. \n"
    2: "² Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God:\
      \ and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. \n"
    3: "³ For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then\
      \ not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise\
      \ of the same: \n"
    4: "⁴ For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which\
      \ is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister\
      \ of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. \n"
    5: "⁵ Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience\
      \ sake. \n"
    6: "⁶ For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending\
      \ continually upon this very thing. \n"
    7: "⁷ Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom\
      \ to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. \n"
    8: "⁸ Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another\
      \ hath fulfilled the law. \n"
    9: "⁹ For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt\
      \ not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if\
      \ there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,\
      \ namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling\
      \ of the law. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep:\
      \ for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. \n"
    12: "¹² The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off\
      \ the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. \n"
    13: "¹³ Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not\
      \ in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh,
      to fulfil the lusts thereof.
  14:
    1: "¹ Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth\
      \ herbs. \n"
    3: "³ Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which\
      \ eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth\
      \ or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike.\
      \ Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. \n"
    6: "⁶ He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth\
      \ not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to\
      \ the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he\
      \ eateth not, and giveth God thanks. \n"
    7: "⁷ For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. \n"
    8: "⁸ For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto\
      \ the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. \n"
    9: "⁹ For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be\
      \ Lord both of the dead and living. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy\
      \ brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to\
      \ me, and every tongue shall confess to God. \n"
    12: "¹² So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. \n"
    13: "¹³ Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather,\
      \ that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean\
      \ of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is\
      \ unclean. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably.\
      \ Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Let not then your good be evil spoken of: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace,\
      \ and joy in the Holy Ghost. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved\
      \ of men. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things\
      \ wherewith one may edify another. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but\
      \ it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. \n"
    21: "²¹ It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby\
      \ thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. \n"
    22: "²² Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth\
      \ not himself in that thing which he alloweth. \n"
    23: '²³ And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith:
      for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.'
  15:
    1: "¹ We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not\
      \ to please ourselves. \n"
    2: "² Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. \n"
    3: "³ For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches\
      \ of them that reproached thee fell on me. \n"
    4: "⁴ For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning,\
      \ that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward\
      \ another according to Christ Jesus: \n"
    6: "⁶ That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of\
      \ our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    7: "⁷ Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory\
      \ of God. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth\
      \ of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: \n"
    9: "⁹ And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written,\
      \ For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy\
      \ name. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall\
      \ rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. \n"
    13: "¹³ Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that\
      \ ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full\
      \ of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some\
      \ sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of\
      \ God, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering\
      \ the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable,\
      \ being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things\
      \ which pertain to God. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath\
      \ not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so\
      \ that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached\
      \ the gospel of Christ. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named,\
      \ lest I should build upon another man's foundation: \n"
    21: "²¹ But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and\
      \ they that have not heard shall understand. \n"
    22: "²² For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. \n"
    23: "²³ But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire\
      \ these many years to come unto you; \n"
    24: "²⁴ Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust\
      \ to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you,\
      \ if first I be somewhat filled with your company. \n"
    25: "²⁵ But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution\
      \ for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. \n"
    27: "²⁷ It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles\
      \ have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to\
      \ minister unto them in carnal things. \n"
    28: "²⁸ When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit,\
      \ I will come by you into Spain. \n"
    29: "²⁹ And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness\
      \ of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for\
      \ the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to\
      \ God for me; \n"
    31: "³¹ That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that\
      \ my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; \n"
    32: "³² That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you\
      \ be refreshed. \n"
    33: ³³ Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
  16:
    1: "¹ I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which\
      \ is at Cenchrea: \n"
    2: "² That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist\
      \ her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer\
      \ of many, and of myself also. \n"
    3: "³ Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: \n"
    4: "⁴ Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give\
      \ thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. \n"
    5: "⁵ Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved\
      \ Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. \n"
    6: "⁶ Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. \n"

      \ Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. \n"

    14: "¹⁴ Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren\
      \ which are with them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and\
      \ all the saints which are with them. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences\
      \ contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own\
      \ belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on\
      \ your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple\
      \ concerning evil. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace\
      \ of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. \n"
    21: "²¹ Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen,\
      \ salute you. \n"
    22: "²² I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. \n"
    23: "²³ Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain\
      \ of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. \n"
    24: "²⁴ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and\
      \ the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery,\
      \ which was kept secret since the world began, \n"
    26: "²⁶ But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according\
      \ to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the\
      \ obedience of faith: \n"
    27: ²⁷ To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
