    15: "¹⁵ Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into\
      \ the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley\

    16: "¹⁶ And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then\
      \ at Bethlehem. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water\

    39: "³⁹ And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their\

    40: '⁴⁰ Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and

  13:
    1: "¹ And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with\
      \ every leader. \n"
    2: "² And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto\

      \ every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to\
      \ the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may\
      \ gather themselves unto us: \n"
    3: "³ And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at\

    4: "⁴ And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right\
      \ in the eyes of all the people. \n"
    5: "⁵ So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the\
      \ entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. \n"
    6: "⁶ And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim,\
      \ which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the Lord, that\
      \ dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. \n"
    7: "⁷ And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab:\
      \ and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. \n"
    8: "⁸ And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with\
      \ singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with\
      \ cymbals, and with trumpets. \n"
    9: "⁹ And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his\

    10: "¹⁰ And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him,\
      \ because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzza:\
      \ wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. \n"
    12: "¹² And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark\
      \ of God home to me? \n"
    13: "¹³ So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but\
      \ carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three
      months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
  14:
    1: "¹ Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with\
      \ masons and carpenters, to build him an house. \n"
    2: "² And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, for\

    3: "³ And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua,\

      \ out against them. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines?\
      \ And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go\
      \ up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. \n"
    11: "¹¹ So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David\
      \ said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking\
      \ forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and\
      \ they were burned with fire. \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up\
      \ after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry\
      \ trees. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of\
      \ the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone\
      \ forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the\
      \ Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the
      fear of him upon all nations.
  15:
    1: "¹ And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for\
      \ the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. \n"
    2: "² Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for\
      \ them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him\
      \ for ever. \n"
    3: "³ And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark\
      \ of the Lord unto his place, which he had prepared for it. \n"
    4: "⁴ And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: \n"
    5: "⁵ Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and\
      \ twenty: \n"
    6: "⁶ Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and\
      \ twenty: \n"
    7: "⁷ Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty:\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred\
      \ and twelve. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites,\
      \ for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, \n"
    12: "¹² And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify\
      \ yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the\
      \ Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. \n"
    13: "¹³ For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach\
      \ upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark\
      \ of the Lord God of Israel. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders\
      \ with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren\

    17: "¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph\

    19: "¹⁹ So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with\

    22: "²² And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about\
      \ the song, because he was skilful. \n"
    23: "²³ And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah,\
      \ and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the\
      \ ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: "²⁵ So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went\
      \ to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom\
      \ with joy. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of\
      \ the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that\
      \ bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the\
      \ singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting,\
      \ and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making\
      \ a noise with psalteries and harps. \n"
    29: '²⁹ And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the
      city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw
      king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.'
  16:
    1: "¹ So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that\
      \ David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings\
      \ before God. \n"
    2: "² And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace\
      \ offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a\
      \ loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. \n"
    4: "⁴ And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the\
      \ Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel: \n"
    5: "⁵ Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and\
      \ Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with\
      \ psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; \n"
    6: "⁶ Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the\
      \ ark of the covenant of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into\
      \ the hand of Asaph and his brethren. \n"
    8: "⁸ Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among\
      \ the people. \n"
    9: "⁹ Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.\

    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a\

  17:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan\

    2: "² Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with\

    3: "³ And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan,\

    4: "⁴ Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build\
      \ me an house to dwell in: \n"
    5: "⁵ For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel\

      \ another. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the\

      \ not built me an house of cedars? \n"
    7: "⁷ Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the\
      \ Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep,\
      \ that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: \n"
    8: "⁸ And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off\

    10: "¹⁰ And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.\
      \ Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the\
      \ Lord will build thee an house. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go\

    18: "¹⁸ What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou\

    20: "²⁰ O Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee,\

    21: "²¹ And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went\

      \ by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out\
      \ of Egypt? \n"
    22: "²² For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou,\
      \ Lord, becamest their God. \n"
    23: "²³ Therefore now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy\
      \ servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast\
      \ said. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying,\
      \ The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the\
      \ house of David thy servant be established before thee. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an\
      \ house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ And now, Lord, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy\

    27: '²⁷ Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that

      for ever.'
  18:
    1: "¹ Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued\
      \ them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. \n"
    2: "² And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought\
      \ gifts. \n"
    3: "³ And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish\
      \ his dominion by the river Euphrates. \n"
    4: "⁴ And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen,\
      \ and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but\
      \ reserved of them an hundred chariots. \n"
    5: "⁵ And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David\
      \ slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's\
      \ servants, and brought gifts. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he\
      \ went. \n"
    7: "⁷ And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer,\
      \ and brought them to Jerusalem. \n"
    8: "⁸ Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David\
      \ very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and\
      \ the vessels of brass. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of\
      \ Hadarezer king of Zobah; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and\
      \ to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten\
      \ him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels\
      \ of gold and silver and brass. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Them also king David dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver and the\
      \ gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and\
      \ from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. \n"
    12: "¹² Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley\
      \ of salt eighteen thousand. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants.\
      \ Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among\
      \ all his people. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son\
      \ of Ahilud, recorder. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the\
      \ priests; and Shavsha was scribe; \n"
    17: ¹⁷ And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
      and the sons of David were chief about the king.
  19:
    1: "¹ Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of\
      \ Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. \n"
    2: "² And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because\
      \ his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him\
      \ concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the\
      \ children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. \n"
    3: "³ But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that\
      \ David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are\
      \ not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy\
      \ out the land? \n"
    4: "⁴ Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their\
      \ garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he\
      \ sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry\
      \ at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. \n"
    6: "⁶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious\
      \ to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver\
      \ to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah,\
      \ and out of Zobah. \n"
    7: "⁷ So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah\
      \ and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon\
      \ gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. \n"
    8: "⁸ And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty\
      \ men. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the\
      \ gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind,\
      \ he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the\
      \ Syrians. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother,\
      \ and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. \n"
    12: "¹² And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help\
      \ me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help\
      \ thee. \n"
    13: "¹³ Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people,\
      \ and for the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in his\
      \ sight. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians\
      \ unto the battle; and they fled before him. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise\
      \ fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came\
      \ to Jerusalem. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,\
      \ they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river:\
      \ and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan,\
      \ and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David\
      \ had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven\
      \ thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed\
      \ Shophach the captain of the host. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse
      before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither
      would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.'
  20:
    1: "¹ And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings\
      \ go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country\
      \ of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried\
      \ at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. \n"
    2: "² And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to\
      \ weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set\
      \ upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and\
      \ with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities\
      \ of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines;\
      \ at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children\
      \ of the giant: and they were subdued. \n"
    5: "⁵ And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair\
      \ slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like\
      \ a weaver's beam. \n"
    6: "⁶ And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose\
      \ fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot\
      \ and he also was the son of the giant. \n"
    7: "⁷ But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew\
      \ him. \n"
    8: ⁸ These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David,
      and by the hand of his servants.
  21:
    1: "¹ And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel\
      \ from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may\
      \ know it. \n"
    3: "³ And Joab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many more\
      \ as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why\
      \ then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to\
      \ Israel? \n"
    4: "⁴ Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed,\
      \ and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. \n"
    5: "⁵ And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they\
      \ of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword:\
      \ and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was\
      \ abominable to Joab. \n"
    7: "⁷ And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this\
      \ thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I\
      \ have done very foolishly. \n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things:\
      \ choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. \n"
    11: "¹¹ So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy\
      \ foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three\
      \ days the sword of the Lord, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel\
      \ of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore\
      \ advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. \n"
    13: "¹³ And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into\
      \ the hand of the Lord; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall\
      \ into the hand of man. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy\
      \ thousand men. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying,\
      \ the Lord beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that\
      \ destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood\
      \ by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand between\
      \ the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over\
      \ Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth,\
      \ fell upon their faces. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered?\
      \ even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep,\
      \ what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me,\
      \ and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David, that David should\
      \ go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the\
      \ Jebusite. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid\
      \ themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. \n"
    21: "²¹ And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of\
      \ the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that\
      \ I may build an altar therein unto the Lord: thou shalt grant it me for the\
      \ full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. \n"
    23: "²³ And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do\
      \ that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings,\
      \ and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering;\
      \ I give it all. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full\
      \ price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt\
      \ offerings without cost. \n"
    25: "²⁵ So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings\
      \ and peace offerings, and called upon the Lord; and he answered him from heaven\
      \ by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And the Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the\
      \ sheath thereof. \n"
    28: "²⁸ At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshingfloor\
      \ of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the wilderness, and\
      \ the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at\
      \ Gibeon. \n"
    30: '³⁰ But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid
      because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.'
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar\
      \ of the burnt offering for Israel. \n"
    2: "² And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land\
      \ of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the\
      \ gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; \n"
    4: "⁴ Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought\
      \ much cedar wood to David. \n"
    5: "⁵ And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is\
      \ to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory\
      \ throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So\
      \ David prepared abundantly before his death. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for\
      \ the Lord God of Israel. \n"
    7: "⁷ And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build\
      \ an house unto the name of the Lord my God: \n"
    8: "⁸ But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly,\
      \ and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because\
      \ thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. \n"
    9: "⁹ Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will\
      \ give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon,\
      \ and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will\
      \ be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel\
      \ for ever. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now, my son, the Lord be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house\
      \ of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee. \n"
    12: "¹² Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge\
      \ concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and\
      \ judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong,\
      \ and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an\
      \ hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver;\
      \ and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also\
      \ and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers\
      \ of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.\
      \ Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,\
      \ saying, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every\
      \ side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the\
      \ land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise therefore,
      and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built
      to the name of the Lord.
  23:
    1: "¹ So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over\
      \ Israel. \n"
    2: "² And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and\
      \ the Levites. \n"
    3: "³ Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and\
      \ their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. \n"
    4: "⁴ Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house\
      \ of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges: \n"
    5: "⁵ Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the Lord\
      \ with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. \n"
    6: "⁶ And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon,\
      \ Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: "⁷ Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei. \n"
    8: "⁸ The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. \n"
    9: "⁹ The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were\
      \ the chief of the fathers of Laadan. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These\
      \ four were the sons of Shimei. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had\
      \ not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's\
      \ house. \n"
    12: "¹² The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. \n"
    13: "¹³ The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should\
      \ sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before\
      \ the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe\
      \ of Levi. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none\
      \ other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel\
      \ the third, and Jekameam the fourth. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second. \n"
    21: "²¹ The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and\
      \ Kish. \n"
    22: "²² And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the\
      \ sons of Kish took them. \n"
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. \n"
    24: "²⁴ These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the\
      \ chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls,\
      \ that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from the age of\
      \ twenty years and upward. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For David said, The Lord God of Israel hath given rest unto his people,\
      \ that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: \n"
    26: "²⁶ And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor\
      \ any vessels of it for the service thereof. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years\
      \ old and above: \n"
    28: "²⁸ Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service\
      \ of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying\
      \ of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; \n"
    29: "²⁹ Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and\
      \ for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for\
      \ that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; \n"
    30: "³⁰ And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and likewise\
      \ at even: \n"
    31: "³¹ And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord in the sabbaths, in the\
      \ new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded\
      \ unto them, continually before the Lord: \n"
    32: ³² And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation,
      and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their
      brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord.
  24:
    1: "¹ Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab,\
      \ and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. \n"
    2: "² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore\
      \ Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office. \n"
    3: "³ And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech\
      \ of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. \n"
    4: "⁴ And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons\
      \ of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were\
      \ sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons\
      \ of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors\

  29:
    1: "¹ Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son,\
      \ whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great:\
      \ for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God. \n"
    2: "² Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for\
      \ things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass\
      \ for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood;\
      \ onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours,\
      \ and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. \n"
    3: "³ Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have\
      \ of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house\
      \ of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house. \n"
    4: "⁴ Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand\
      \ talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal: \n"
    5: "⁵ The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for\
      \ all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is\
      \ willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord? \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the\
      \ captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work,\
      \ offered willingly, \n"
    7: "⁷ And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents\
      \ and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen\
      \ thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. \n"
    8: "⁸ And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure\
      \ of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with\
      \ perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and David the king also\
      \ rejoiced with great joy. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation: and David\
      \ said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the\
      \ victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is\
      \ thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in\
      \ thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and\
      \ to give strength unto all. \n"
    13: "¹³ Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so\
      \ willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have\
      \ we given thee. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers:\
      \ our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an\
      \ house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in\
      \ uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly\
      \ offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are\
      \ present here, to offer willingly unto thee. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for\
      \ ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare\
      \ their heart unto thee: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments,\
      \ thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build\
      \ the palace, for the which I have made provision. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord your God. And\
      \ all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed down\
      \ their heads, and worshipped the Lord, and the king. \n"
    21: "²¹ And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings\
      \ unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand\
      \ rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in\
      \ abundance for all Israel: \n"
    22: "²² And did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great gladness.\
      \ And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed\
      \ him unto the Lord to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. \n"
    23: "²³ Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his\
      \ father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of\
      \ king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel,\
      \ and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before\
      \ him in Israel. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years\
      \ reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon\
      \ his son reigned in his stead. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written\
      \ in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and\
      \ in the book of Gad the seer, \n"
    30: ³⁰ With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and
      over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
