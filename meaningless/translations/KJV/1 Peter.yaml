1 Peter:
  1:
    1: "¹ Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout\
      \ Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, \n"
    2: "² Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification\
      \ of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:\
      \ Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. \n"
    3: "³ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according\
      \ to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection\
      \ of Jesus Christ from the dead, \n"
    4: "⁴ To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,\
      \ reserved in heaven for you, \n"
    5: "⁵ Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be\
      \ revealed in the last time. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are\
      \ in heaviness through manifold temptations: \n"
    7: "⁷ That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that\
      \ perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour\
      \ and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: \n"
    8: "⁸ Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing,\
      \ ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: \n"
    9: "⁹ Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently,\
      \ who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: \n"
    11: "¹¹ Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was\
      \ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ,\
      \ and the glory that should follow. \n"
    12: "¹² Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they\
      \ did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have\
      \ preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which\
      \ things the angels desire to look into. \n"
    13: "¹³ Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end\
      \ for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former\
      \ lusts in your ignorance: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of\
      \ conversation; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according\
      \ to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,\
      \ as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from\
      \ your fathers; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and\
      \ without spot: \n"
    20: "²⁰ Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was\
      \ manifest in these last times for you, \n"
    21: "²¹ Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave\
      \ him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. \n"
    22: "²² Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit\
      \ unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure\
      \ heart fervently: \n"
    23: "²³ Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the\
      \ word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.\
      \ The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: \n"
    25: ²⁵ But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which
      by the gospel is preached unto you.
  2:
    1: "¹ Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,\
      \ and all evil speakings, \n"
    2: "² As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow\
      \ thereby: \n"
    3: "³ If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. \n"
    4: "⁴ To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen\
      \ of God, and precious, \n"
    5: "⁵ Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood,\
      \ to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a\
      \ chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not\
      \ be confounded. \n"
    7: "⁷ Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be\
      \ disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the\
      \ head of the corner, \n"
    8: "⁸ And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble\
      \ at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. \n"
    9: "⁹ But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar\
      \ people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out\
      \ of darkness into his marvellous light; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which\
      \ had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from\
      \ fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; \n"
    12: "¹² Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they\
      \ speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall\
      \ behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. \n"
    13: "¹³ Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether\
      \ it be to the king, as supreme; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment\
      \ of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence\
      \ the ignorance of foolish men: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but\
      \ as the servants of God. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good\
      \ and gentle, but also to the froward. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,\
      \ suffering wrongfully. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall\
      \ take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it\
      \ patiently, this is acceptable with God. \n"
    21: "²¹ For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,\
      \ leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: \n"
    22: "²² Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: \n"
    23: "²³ Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened\
      \ not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: \n"
    24: "²⁴ Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being\
      \ dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.\
      \ \n"
    25: ²⁵ For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd
      and Bishop of your souls.
  3:
    1: "¹ Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any\
      \ obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation\
      \ of the wives; \n"
    2: "² While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. \n"
    3: "³ Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair,\
      \ and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; \n"
    4: "⁴ But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,\
      \ even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God\
      \ of great price. \n"
    5: "⁵ For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in\
      \ God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: \n"
    6: "⁶ Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as\
      \ long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. \n"
    7: "⁷ Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour\
      \ unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the\
      \ grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. \n"
    8: "⁸ Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as\
      \ brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: \n"
    9: "⁹ Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing;\
      \ knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue\
      \ from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: \n"
    11: "¹¹ Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. \n"
    12: "¹² For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open\
      \ unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is\
      \ good? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not\
      \ afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give\
      \ an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you\
      \ with meekness and fear: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of\
      \ evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation\
      \ in Christ. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing,\
      \ than for evil doing. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,\
      \ that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened\
      \ by the Spirit: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; \n"
    20: "²⁰ Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited\
      \ in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,\
      \ eight souls were saved by water. \n"
    21: "²¹ The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the\
      \ putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience\
      \ toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: \n"
    22: ²² Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities
      and powers being made subject unto him.
  4:
    1: "¹ Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves\
      \ likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased\
      \ from sin; \n"
    2: "² That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts\
      \ of men, but to the will of God. \n"
    3: "³ For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of\
      \ the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,\
      \ banquetings, and abominable idolatries: \n"
    4: "⁴ Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess\
      \ of riot, speaking evil of you: \n"
    5: "⁵ Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that\
      \ they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to\
      \ God in the spirit. \n"
    7: "⁷ But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto\
      \ prayer. \n"
    8: "⁸ And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity\
      \ shall cover the multitude of sins. \n"
    9: "⁹ Use hospitality one to another without grudging. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to\
      \ another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister,\
      \ let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may\
      \ be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever\
      \ and ever. Amen. \n"
    12: "¹² Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try\
      \ you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: \n"
    13: "¹³ But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that,\
      \ when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit\
      \ of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of,\
      \ but on your part he is glorified. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer,\
      \ or as a busybody in other men's matters. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let\
      \ him glorify God on this behalf. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and\
      \ if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel\
      \ of God? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the\
      \ sinner appear? \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the
      keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
  5:
    1: "¹ The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness\
      \ of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be\
      \ revealed: \n"
    2: "² Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof,\
      \ not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory\
      \ that fadeth not away. \n"
    5: "⁵ Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you\
      \ be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth\
      \ the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. \n"
    6: "⁶ Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt\
      \ you in due time: \n"
    7: "⁷ Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. \n"
    8: "⁸ Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,\
      \ walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: \n"
    9: "⁹ Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are\
      \ accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by\
      \ Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish,\
      \ strengthen, settle you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. \n"
    12: "¹² By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written\
      \ briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein\
      \ ye stand. \n"
    13: "¹³ The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you;\
      \ and so doth Marcus my son. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that
      are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
