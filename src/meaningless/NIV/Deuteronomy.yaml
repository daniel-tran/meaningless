Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of
      the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban,
      Hazeroth and Dizahab. '
    2: "² (It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir\
      \ road.) \n"
    3: '³ In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed
      to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them. '
    4: "⁴ This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in\
      \ Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this\
      \ law, saying: \n"
    6: '⁶ The Lord our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this
      mountain. '
    7: '⁷ Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all
      the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills,
      in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon,
      as far as the great river, the Euphrates. '
    8: "⁸ See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the\
      \ Lord swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to\
      \ their descendants after them.” \n"
    9: '⁹ At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry
      alone. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as
      numerous as the stars in the sky. '
    11: '¹¹ May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times
      and bless you as he has promised! '
    12: '¹² But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all
      by myself? '
    13: "¹³ Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes,\
      \ and I will set them over you.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and
      appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds,
      of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your
      people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between
      an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do
      not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too
      hard for you, and I will hear it.” '
    18: "¹⁸ And at that time I told you everything you were to do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then, as the Lord our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went
      toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness
      that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea. '
    20: '²⁰ Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites,
      which the Lord our God is giving us. '
    21: "²¹ See, the Lord your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession\
      \ of it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid;\
      \ do not be discouraged.” \n"
    22: "²² Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out\
      \ the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and\
      \ the towns we will come to.” \n"
    23: '²³ The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from
      each tribe. '
    24: '²⁴ They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of
      Eshkol and explored it. '
    25: "²⁵ Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to\
      \ us and reported, “It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the
      Lord your God. '
    27: '²⁷ You grumbled in your tents and said, “The Lord hates us; so he brought
      us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us. '
    28: "²⁸ Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They\
      \ say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large,\
      \ with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. '
    30: '³⁰ The Lord your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he
      did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, '
    31: "³¹ and in the wilderness. There you saw how the Lord your God carried you,\
      \ as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.”\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² In spite of this, you did not trust in the Lord your God, '
    33: "³³ who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud\
      \ by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should\
      \ go. \n"
    34: '³⁴ When the Lord heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore: '
    35: '³⁵ “No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give
      your ancestors, '
    36: "³⁶ except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and\
      \ his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the Lord\
      \ wholeheartedly.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ Because of you the Lord became angry with me also and said, “You shall
      not enter it, either. '
    38: '³⁸ But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because
      he will lead Israel to inherit it. '
    39: '³⁹ And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children
      who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to
      them and they will take possession of it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route\
      \ to the Red Sea.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Then you replied, “We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and\
      \ fight, as the Lord our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons,\
      \ thinking it easy to go up into the hill country. \n"
    42: "⁴² But the Lord said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because\
      \ I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’” \n"
    43: '⁴³ So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the Lord’s
      command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country. '
    44: '⁴⁴ The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased
      you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You came back and wept before the Lord, but he paid no attention to your
      weeping and turned a deaf ear to you. '
    46: ⁴⁶ And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
  2:
    1: "¹ Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to\
      \ the Red Sea, as the Lord had directed me. For a long time we made our way\
      \ around the hill country of Seir. \n"
    2: '² Then the Lord said to me, '
    3: '³ “You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. '
    4: '⁴ Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory
      of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid
      of you, but be very careful. '
    5: '⁵ Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not
      even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir
      as his own. '
    6: "⁶ You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has\
      \ watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years\
      \ the Lord your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything. \n"
    8: "⁸ So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir.\
      \ We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber,\
      \ and traveled along the desert road of Moab. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to\
      \ war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the\
      \ descendants of Lot as a possession.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ (The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall
      as the Anakites. '
    11: '¹¹ Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites
      called them Emites. '
    12: "¹² Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out.\
      \ They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just\
      \ as Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their possession.) \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed\
      \ the valley. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we
      crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had
      perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them\
      \ from the camp. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, '
    17: '¹⁷ the Lord said to me, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar. '
    19: "¹⁹ When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to\
      \ war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites.\
      \ I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ (That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there;
      but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. '
    21: '²¹ They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The
      Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled
      in their place. '
    22: '²² The Lord had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir,
      when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have
      lived in their place to this day. '
    23: "²³ And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites\
      \ coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.) \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand
      Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession
      of it and engage him in battle. '
    25: "²⁵ This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the\
      \ nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be\
      \ in anguish because of you.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon
      offering peace and saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will
      not turn aside to the right or to the left. '
    28: '²⁸ Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only
      let us pass through on foot— '
    29: '²⁹ as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live
      in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is
      giving us.” '
    30: "³⁰ But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the Lord\
      \ your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to\
      \ give him into your hands, as he has now done. \n"
    31: "³¹ The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country\
      \ over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.” \n"
    32: '³² When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz, '
    33: '³³ the Lord our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together
      with his sons and his whole army. '
    34: '³⁴ At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them—men,
      women and children. We left no survivors. '
    35: '³⁵ But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried
      off for ourselves. '
    36: '³⁶ From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge,
      even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The Lord our God
      gave us all of them. '
    37: ³⁷ But in accordance with the command of the Lord our God, you did not encroach
      on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the
      Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.
  3:
    1: '¹ Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of
      Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. '
    2: "² The Lord said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him\
      \ into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you\
      \ did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” \n"
    3: '³ So the Lord our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his
      army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors. '
    4: '⁴ At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities
      that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. '
    5: '⁵ All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars,
      and there were also a great many unwalled villages. '
    6: '⁶ We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon,
      destroying every city—men, women and children. '
    7: "⁷ But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for\
      \ ourselves. \n"
    8: '⁸ So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory
      east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. '
    9: '⁹ (Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) '
    10: '¹⁰ We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as
      far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. '
    11: "¹¹ (Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated\
      \ with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. It is still\
      \ in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) \n"
    12: '¹² Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and
      the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half
      the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. '
    13: '¹³ The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to
      the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be
      known as a land of the Rephaites. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far
      as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him,
      so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.) '
    15: '¹⁵ And I gave Gilead to Makir. '
    16: '¹⁶ But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from
      Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and
      out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. '
    17: "¹⁷ Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the\
      \ Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I commanded you at that time: “The Lord your God has given you this land
      to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must
      cross over ahead of the other Israelites. '
    19: '¹⁹ However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have
      much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, '
    20: "²⁰ until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you,\
      \ and they too have taken over the land that the Lord your God is giving them\
      \ across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I\
      \ have given you.” \n"
    21: '²¹ At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all
      that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same
      to all the kingdoms over there where you are going. '
    22: "²² Do not be afraid of them; the Lord your God himself will fight for you.”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ At that time I pleaded with the Lord: '
    24: '²⁴ “Sovereign Lord, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness
      and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do
      the deeds and mighty works you do? '
    25: "²⁵ Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill\
      \ country and Lebanon.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ But because of you the Lord was angry with me and would not listen to
      me. “That is enough,” the Lord said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this
      matter. '
    27: '²⁷ Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east.
      Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. '
    28: '²⁸ But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead
      this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” '
    29: ²⁹ So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them
      so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the Lord,
      the God of your ancestors, is giving you. '
    2: "² Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the\
      \ commands of the Lord your God that I give you. \n"
    3: '³ You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your
      God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor, '
    4: "⁴ but all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are still alive today.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me,
      so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession
      of it. '
    6: '⁶ Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding
      to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this
      great nation is a wise and understanding people.” '
    7: '⁷ What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the
      Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him? '
    8: "⁸ And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and\
      \ laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today? \n"
    9: '⁹ Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget
      the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you
      live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. '
    10: '¹⁰ Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when he
      said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may
      learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their
      children.” '
    11: '¹¹ You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with
      fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words
      but saw no form; there was only a voice. '
    13: '¹³ He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded
      you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the Lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws\
      \ you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out
      of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, '
    16: '¹⁶ so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an
      image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, '
    17: '¹⁷ or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, '
    18: '¹⁸ or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters
      below. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all
      the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping
      things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. '
    20: "²⁰ But as for you, the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting\
      \ furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that
      I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving
      you as your inheritance. '
    22: '²² I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about
      to cross over and take possession of that good land. '
    23: '²³ Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made
      with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord
      your God has forbidden. '
    24: "²⁴ For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land
      a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil
      in the eyes of the Lord your God and arousing his anger, '
    26: '²⁶ I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that
      you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
      You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will
      survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you. '
    28: '²⁸ There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see
      or hear or eat or smell. '
    29: '²⁹ But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you
      seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. '
    30: '³⁰ When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then
      in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him. '
    31: "³¹ For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy\
      \ you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them\
      \ by oath. \n"
    32: '³² Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God
      created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other.
      Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been
      heard of? '
    33: '³³ Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you
      have, and lived? '
    34: "³⁴ Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation,\
      \ by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched\
      \ arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God\
      \ did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? \n"
    35: '³⁵ You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God;
      besides him there is no other. '
    36: '³⁶ From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he
      showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. '
    37: '³⁷ Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them,
      he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, '
    38: "³⁸ to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring\
      \ you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven
      above and on the earth below. There is no other. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it\
      \ may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long\
      \ in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, '
    42: '⁴² to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally
      killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these
      cities and save their life. '
    43: "⁴³ The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites;\
      \ Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.\
      \ \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ This is the law Moses set before the Israelites. '
    45: '⁴⁵ These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they
      came out of Egypt '
    46: '⁴⁶ and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land
      of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses
      and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the
      two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. '
    48: '⁴⁸ This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion
      (that is, Hermon), '
    49: ⁴⁹ and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea,
      below the slopes of Pisgah.
  5:
    1: "¹ Moses summoned all Israel and said:\nHear, Israel, the decrees and laws\
      \ I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. "
    2: '² The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. '
    3: '³ It was not with our ancestors that the Lord made this covenant, but with
      us, with all of us who are alive here today. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain. '
    5: "⁵ (At that time I stood between the Lord and you to declare to you the word\
      \ of the Lord, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.)\
      \ And he said: \n"
    6: "⁶ “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of\
      \ slavery. \n"
    7: "⁷ “You shall have no other gods before me. \n"
    8: '⁸ “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven
      above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. '
    9: '⁹ You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God,
      am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third
      and fourth generation of those who hate me, '
    10: "¹⁰ but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep\
      \ my commandments. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will\
      \ not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. \n"
    12: '¹² “Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has
      commanded you. '
    13: '¹³ Six days you shall labor and do all your work, '
    14: '¹⁴ but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall
      not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female
      servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner
      residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you
      do. '
    15: "¹⁵ Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought\
      \ you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the\
      \ Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded\
      \ you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land\
      \ the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “You shall not murder. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “You shall not commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “You shall not steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire\
      \ on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey,\
      \ or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” \n"
    22: "²² These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your\
      \ whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the\
      \ deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone\
      \ tablets and gave them to me. \n"
    23: '²³ When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze
      with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. '
    24: '²⁴ And you said, “The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty,
      and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person
      can live even if God speaks with them. '
    25: '²⁵ But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will
      die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer. '
    26: '²⁶ For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out
      of fire, as we have, and survived? '
    27: "²⁷ Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever\
      \ the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ The Lord heard you when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, “I have
      heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good. '
    29: "²⁹ Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands\
      \ always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever! \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Go, tell them to return to their tents. '
    31: "³¹ But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees\
      \ and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.”\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn
      aside to the right or to the left. '
    33: ³³ Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that
      you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
  6:
    1: '¹ These are the commands, decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to
      teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, '
    2: '² so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the Lord
      your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I
      give you, and so that you may enjoy long life. '
    3: "³ Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and\
      \ that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just\
      \ as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you. \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. '
    5: '⁵ Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with
      all your strength. '
    6: '⁶ These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. '
    7: '⁷ Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and
      when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. '
    8: '⁸ Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. '
    9: "⁹ Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the Lord your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers,
      to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities
      you did not build, '
    11: '¹¹ houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells
      you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when
      you eat and are satisfied, '
    12: "¹² be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt,\
      \ out of the land of slavery. \n"
    13: '¹³ Fear the Lord your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name. '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; '
    15: '¹⁵ for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger
      will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land. '
    16: '¹⁶ Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did at Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ Be sure to keep the commands of the Lord your God and the stipulations
      and decrees he has given you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so that it may go well
      with you and you may go in and take over the good land the Lord promised on
      oath to your ancestors, '
    19: "¹⁹ thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said. \n"
    20: '²⁰ In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations,
      decrees and laws the Lord our God has commanded you?” '
    21: '²¹ tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord brought us
      out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    22: '²² Before our eyes the Lord sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on
      Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household. '
    23: '²³ But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he
      promised on oath to our ancestors. '
    24: '²⁴ The Lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the Lord our
      God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today. '
    25: ²⁵ And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God, as
      he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.”
  7:
    1: '¹ When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess
      and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites,
      Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger
      than you— '
    2: '² and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated
      them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show
      them no mercy. '
    3: '³ Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or
      take their daughters for your sons, '
    4: '⁴ for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods,
      and the Lord’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. '
    5: '⁵ This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their
      sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire. '
    6: "⁶ For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen\
      \ you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his\
      \ treasured possession. \n"
    7: '⁷ The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were
      more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. '
    8: '⁸ But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your
      ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the
      land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping
      his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep
      his commandments. '
    10: "¹⁰ But\nthose who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;\n\
      \    he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you\
      \ today. \n"
    12: '¹² If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then
      the Lord your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your
      ancestors. '
    13: '¹³ He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless
      the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive
      oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore
      to your ancestors to give you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women
      will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on
      you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all
      who hate you. '
    16: "¹⁶ You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you.\
      \ Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be\
      \ a snare to you. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How
      can we drive them out?” '
    18: '¹⁸ But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the Lord your God did
      to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. '
    19: '¹⁹ You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the
      mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the Lord your God brought you out.
      The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear. '
    20: '²⁰ Moreover, the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until even
      the survivors who hide from you have perished. '
    21: '²¹ Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you,
      is a great and awesome God. '
    22: '²² The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little.
      You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will
      multiply around you. '
    23: '²³ But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into
      great confusion until they are destroyed. '
    24: '²⁴ He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names
      from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy
      them. '
    25: '²⁵ The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the
      silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared
      by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God. '
    26: ²⁶ Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be
      set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is
      set apart for destruction.
  8:
    1: '¹ Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may
      live and increase and may enter and possess the land the Lord promised on oath
      to your ancestors. '
    2: '² Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the wilderness these
      forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart,
      whether or not you would keep his commands. '
    3: '³ He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which
      neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live
      on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty
      years. '
    5: "⁵ Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your\
      \ God disciplines you. \n"
    6: '⁶ Observe the commands of the Lord your God, walking in obedience to him and
      revering him. '
    7: '⁷ For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks,
      streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills; '
    8: '⁸ a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil
      and honey; '
    9: "⁹ a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land\
      \ where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the
      good land he has given you. '
    11: '¹¹ Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe
      his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. '
    12: '¹² Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses
      and settle down, '
    13: '¹³ and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase
      and all you have is multiplied, '
    14: '¹⁴ then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God,
      who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. '
    15: '¹⁵ He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and
      waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water
      out of hard rock. '
    16: '¹⁶ He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had
      never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with
      you. '
    17: '¹⁷ You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced
      this wealth for me.” '
    18: "¹⁸ But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability\
      \ to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors,\
      \ as it is today. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship
      and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. '
    20: ²⁰ Like the nations the Lord destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed
      for not obeying the Lord your God.
  9:
    1: '¹ Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess
      nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up
      to the sky. '
    2: '² The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard
      it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?” '
    3: "³ But be assured today that the Lord your God is the one who goes across ahead\
      \ of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before\
      \ you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the Lord\
      \ has promised you. \n"
    4: '⁴ After the Lord your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself,
      “The Lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my
      righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that
      the Lord is going to drive them out before you. '
    5: '⁵ It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going
      in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these
      nations, the Lord your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what
      he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. '
    6: "⁶ Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked\
      \ people. \n"
    7: '⁷ Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the Lord your
      God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you
      have been rebellious against the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ At Horeb you aroused the Lord’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy
      you. '
    9: '⁹ When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets
      of the covenant that the Lord had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty
      days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. '
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On\
      \ them were all the commandments the Lord proclaimed to you on the mountain\
      \ out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. \n"
    11: '¹¹ At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two
      stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. '
    12: "¹² Then the Lord told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people\
      \ whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly\
      \ from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.” \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Lord said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked
      people indeed! '
    14: "¹⁴ Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from\
      \ under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous\
      \ than they.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire.
      And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. '
    16: '¹⁶ When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God; you
      had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned
      aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you. '
    17: "¹⁷ So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them\
      \ to pieces before your eyes. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then once again I fell prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty
      nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed,
      doing what was evil in the Lord’s sight and so arousing his anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord, for he was angry enough with
      you to destroy you. But again the Lord listened to me. '
    20: '²⁰ And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time
      I prayed for Aaron too. '
    21: "²¹ Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned\
      \ it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust\
      \ and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain. \n"
    22: "²² You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ And when the Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and
      take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the
      command of the Lord your God. You did not trust him or obey him. '
    24: "²⁴ You have been rebellious against the Lord ever since I have known you.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ I lay prostrate before the Lord those forty days and forty nights because
      the Lord had said he would destroy you. '
    26: '²⁶ I prayed to the Lord and said, “Sovereign Lord, do not destroy your people,
      your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of
      Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    27: '²⁷ Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness
      of this people, their wickedness and their sin. '
    28: '²⁸ Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the
      Lord was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because
      he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’ '
    29: ²⁹ But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your
      great power and your outstretched arm.”
  10:
    1: '¹ At that time the Lord said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the
      first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark. '
    2: "² I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which\
      \ you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.” \n"
    3: '³ So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets
      like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my
      hands. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments
      he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the
      assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. '
    5: "⁵ Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had\
      \ made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now. \n"
    6: '⁶ (The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There
      Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. '
    7: '⁷ From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams
      of water. '
    8: '⁸ At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the
      covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister and to pronounce
      blessings in his name, as they still do today. '
    9: "⁹ That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow\
      \ Israelites; the Lord is their inheritance, as the Lord your God told them.)\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did
      the first time, and the Lord listened to me at this time also. It was not his
      will to destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ “Go,” the Lord said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that\
      \ they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the
      Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the Lord your
      God with all your heart and with all your soul, '
    13: "¹³ and to observe the Lord’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today\
      \ for your own good? \n"
    14: '¹⁴ To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the
      earth and everything in it. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yet the Lord set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he
      chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today. '
    16: '¹⁶ Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God,
      mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. '
    18: '¹⁸ He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner
      residing among you, giving them food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were
      foreigners in Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ Fear the Lord your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths
      in his name. '
    21: '²¹ He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those
      great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. '
    22: ²² Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the
      Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
  11:
    1: '¹ Love the Lord your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws
      and his commands always. '
    2: '² Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced
      the discipline of the Lord your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched
      arm; '
    3: '³ the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both
      to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; '
    4: '⁴ what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed
      them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you, and how the Lord
      brought lasting ruin on them. '
    5: '⁵ It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until
      you arrived at this place, '
    6: '⁶ and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when
      the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them
      up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to
      them. '
    7: "⁷ But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the Lord has done.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may
      have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the
      Jordan to possess, '
    9: '⁹ and so that you may live long in the land the Lord swore to your ancestors
      to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    10: '¹⁰ The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt,
      from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot
      as in a vegetable garden. '
    11: '¹¹ But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land
      of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. '
    12: "¹² It is a land the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God\
      \ are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end. \n"
    13: '¹³ So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the
      Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul— '
    14: '¹⁴ then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring
      rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. '
    15: "¹⁵ I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and\
      \ be satisfied. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods
      and bow down to them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Lord’s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens
      so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will
      soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols
      on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. '
    19: '¹⁹ Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and
      when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. '
    20: '²⁰ Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, '
    21: "²¹ so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land\
      \ the Lord swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens\
      \ are above the earth. \n"
    22: '²² If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to
      love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him— '
    23: '²³ then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will
      dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. '
    24: '²⁴ Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will
      extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean
      Sea. '
    25: "²⁵ No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God, as he promised\
      \ you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse— '
    27: '²⁷ the blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving
      you today; '
    28: '²⁸ the curse if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God and turn from
      the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not
      known. '
    29: '²⁹ When the Lord your God has brought you into the land you are entering
      to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount
      Ebal the curses. '
    30: '³⁰ As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the
      setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites
      living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal. '
    31: '³¹ You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the
      land the Lord your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living
      there, '
    32: ³² be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you
      today.
  12:
    1: '¹ These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land
      that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as
      you live in the land. '
    2: '² Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and
      under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship
      their gods. '
    3: "³ Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah\
      \ poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names\
      \ from those places. \n"
    4: '⁴ You must not worship the Lord your God in their way. '
    5: '⁵ But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all
      your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; '
    6: '⁶ there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special
      gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn
      of your herds and flocks. '
    7: "⁷ There, in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your families shall\
      \ eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the\
      \ Lord your God has blessed you. \n"
    8: '⁸ You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, '
    9: '⁹ since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the
      Lord your God is giving you. '
    10: '¹⁰ But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God
      is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies
      around you so that you will live in safety. '
    11: '¹¹ Then to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his
      Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and
      sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you
      have vowed to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² And there rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your sons and daughters,
      your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment
      or inheritance of their own. '
    13: '¹³ Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. '
    14: "¹⁴ Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes,\
      \ and there observe everything I command you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and
      eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according
      to the blessing the Lord your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and
      the clean may eat it. '
    16: '¹⁶ But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. '
    17: '¹⁷ You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine
      and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have
      vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts. '
    18: '¹⁸ Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the
      place the Lord your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your male
      and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice
      before the Lord your God in everything you put your hand to. '
    19: "¹⁹ Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ When the Lord your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you,
      and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat as much
      of it as you want. '
    21: '²¹ If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put his Name is too far
      away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the Lord
      has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as
      much of them as you want. '
    22: '²² Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and
      the clean may eat. '
    23: '²³ But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and
      you must not eat the life with the meat. '
    24: '²⁴ You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. '
    25: "²⁵ Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after\
      \ you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord. \n"
    26: '²⁶ But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give,
      and go to the place the Lord will choose. '
    27: '²⁷ Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God, both the
      meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar
      of the Lord your God, but you may eat the meat. '
    28: "²⁸ Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may\
      \ always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing\
      \ what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God. \n"
    29: '²⁹ The Lord your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to
      invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their
      land, '
    30: '³⁰ and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared
      by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods?
      We will do the same.” '
    31: "³¹ You must not worship the Lord your God in their way, because in worshiping\
      \ their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the Lord hates. They even\
      \ burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods. \n"
    32: ³² See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
  13:
    1: '¹ If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces
      to you a sign or wonder, '
    2: '² and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let
      us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,” '
    3: '³ you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your
      God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and
      with all your soul. '
    4: '⁴ It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his
      commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. '
    5: "⁵ That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against\
      \ the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the\
      \ land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the\
      \ Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among\
      \ you. \n"
    6: '⁶ If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love,
      or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship
      other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, '
    7: '⁷ gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the
      land to the other), '
    8: '⁸ do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare
      them or shield them. '
    9: '⁹ You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting
      them to death, and then the hands of all the people. '
    10: '¹⁰ Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord
      your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. '
    11: "¹¹ Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do\
      \ such an evil thing again. \n"
    12: '¹² If you hear it said about one of the towns the Lord your God is giving
      you to live in '
    13: '¹³ that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their
      town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you have not known), '
    14: '¹⁴ then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it
      is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among
      you, '
    15: '¹⁵ you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must
      destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock. '
    16: '¹⁶ You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public
      square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering
      to the Lord your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt, '
    17: '¹⁷ and none of the condemned things are to be found in your hands. Then the
      Lord will turn from his fierce anger, will show you mercy, and will have compassion
      on you. He will increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your ancestors— '
    18: ¹⁸ because you obey the Lord your God by keeping all his commands that I am
      giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes.
  14:
    1: '¹ You are the children of the Lord your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave
      the front of your heads for the dead, '
    2: "² for you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on\
      \ the face of the earth, the Lord has chosen you to be his treasured possession.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Do not eat any detestable thing. '
    4: '⁴ These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, '
    5: '⁵ the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope
      and the mountain sheep. '
    6: '⁶ You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. '
    7: '⁷ However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may
      not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they
      do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you. '
    8: "⁸ The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew\
      \ the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses. \n"
    9: '⁹ Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins
      and scales. '
    10: "¹⁰ But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you\
      \ it is unclean. \n"
    11: '¹¹ You may eat any clean bird. '
    12: '¹² But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, '
    13: '¹³ the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon, '
    14: '¹⁴ any kind of raven, '
    15: '¹⁵ the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, '
    16: '¹⁶ the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, '
    17: '¹⁷ the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant, '
    18: "¹⁸ the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them. '
    20: "²⁰ But any winged creature that is clean you may eat. \n"
    21: "²¹ Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner\
      \ residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to\
      \ any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the Lord your God.\nDo not\
      \ cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. \n"
    22: '²² Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year. '
    23: '²³ Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn
      of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he
      will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the
      Lord your God always. '
    24: '²⁴ But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the Lord
      your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the Lord will
      choose to put his Name is so far away), '
    25: '²⁵ then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and
      go to the place the Lord your God will choose. '
    26: '²⁶ Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other
      fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat
      there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice. '
    27: "²⁷ And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no\
      \ allotment or inheritance of their own. \n"
    28: '²⁸ At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce
      and store it in your towns, '
    29: ²⁹ so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own)
      and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may
      come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the Lord your God may bless you in
      all the work of your hands.
  15:
    1: '¹ At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. '
    2: '² This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they
      have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone
      among their own people, because the Lord’s time for canceling debts has been
      proclaimed. '
    3: '³ You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your
      fellow Israelite owes you. '
    4: '⁴ However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the Lord
      your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless
      you, '
    5: '⁵ if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these
      commands I am giving you today. '
    6: "⁶ For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend\
      \ to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations\
      \ but none will rule over you. \n"
    7: '⁷ If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the
      land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward
      them. '
    8: '⁸ Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. '
    9: '⁹ Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year
      for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy
      among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to
      the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. '
    10: '¹⁰ Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because
      of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything
      you put your hand to. '
    11: "¹¹ There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you\
      \ to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your\
      \ land. \n"
    12: '¹² If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve
      you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. '
    13: '¹³ And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress.
      Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed\
      \ you. That is why I give you this command today. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because
      he loves you and your family and is well off with you, '
    17: "¹⁷ then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he\
      \ will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their\
      \ service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired\
      \ hand. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and
      flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the
      firstborn of your sheep. '
    20: '²⁰ Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord
      your God at the place he will choose. '
    21: '²¹ If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw,
      you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. '
    22: '²² You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and
      the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer. '
    23: ²³ But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
  16:
    1: '¹ Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover of the Lord your God,
      because in the month of Aviv he brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock
      or herd at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his Name. '
    3: '³ Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened
      bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all

    4: "⁴ Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days.\
      \ Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain\
      \ until morning. \n"
    5: '⁵ You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the Lord your God gives
      you '

      must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary
      of your departure from Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ Roast it and eat it at the place the Lord your God will choose. Then in
      the morning return to your tents. '
    8: "⁸ For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly\
      \ to the Lord your God and do no work. \n"
    9: '⁹ Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing
      grain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the Lord your God by giving a
      freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given
      you. '
    11: '¹¹ And rejoice before the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a
      dwelling for his Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants,

      living among you. '
    12: "¹² Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered
      the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. '
    14: '¹⁴ Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and
      female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows
      who live in your towns. '
    15: "¹⁵ For seven days celebrate the festival to the Lord your God at the place\

    16: '¹⁶ Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at
      the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival

      empty-handed: '
    17: "¹⁷ Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God\

    18: '¹⁸ Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the
      Lord your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly. '
    19: '¹⁹ Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for
      a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent. '
    20: "²⁰ Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the\
      \ land the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    21: '²¹ Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the
      Lord your God, '
    22: ²² and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the Lord your God hates.
  17:
    1: "¹ Do not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect\
      \ or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him. \n"
    2: '² If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you
      is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of his covenant, '
    3: '³ and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them
      or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky, '
    4: '⁴ and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it
      thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing
      has been done in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and
      stone that person to death. '
    6: '⁶ On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death,
      but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. '
    7: "⁷ The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death,\
      \ and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.\

    8: '⁸ If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether
      bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the Lord your God will
      choose. '
    9: '⁹ Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time.
      Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict. '
    10: '¹⁰ You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the
      Lord will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do. '
    11: '¹¹ Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you.

    14: '¹⁴ When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you and have taken
      possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us
      like all the nations around us,” '
    15: '¹⁵ be sure to appoint over you a king the Lord your God chooses. He must
      be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one
      who is not an Israelite. '
    16: '¹⁶ The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself
      or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the Lord has told
      you, “You are not to go back that way again.” '
    17: "¹⁷ He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must\
      \ not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on
      a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests. '
    19: '¹⁹ It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so
      that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words
      of this law and these decrees '
    20: ²⁰ and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from
      the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign
      a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
  18:
    1: '¹ The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment
      or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented
      to the Lord, for that is their inheritance. '
    2: "² They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the Lord is\
      \ their inheritance, as he promised them. \n"
    3: '³ This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or
      a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. '
    4: '⁴ You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil,
      and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, '
    5: "⁵ for the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your\
      \ tribes to stand and minister in the Lord’s name always. \n"
    6: '⁶ If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is
      living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the Lord will choose, '
    7: '⁷ he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites
      who serve there in the presence of the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money\
      \ from the sale of family possessions. \n"
    9: '⁹ When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to
      imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. '
    10: '¹⁰ Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in
      the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in
      witchcraft, '
    11: '¹¹ or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. '
    12: '¹² Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; because of these
      same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before
      you. '
    13: "¹³ You must be blameless before the Lord your God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or
      divination. But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so. '
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you,
      from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. '
    16: "¹⁶ For this is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of\
      \ the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God\
      \ nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord said to me: “What they say is good. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites,
      and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command
      him. '
    19: '¹⁹ I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that
      the prophet speaks in my name. '
    20: "²⁰ But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded,\
      \ or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been
      spoken by the Lord?” '
    22: ²² If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place
      or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken
      presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.
  19:
    1: '¹ When the Lord your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving
      you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses, '
    2: '² then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the Lord your God
      is giving you to possess. '
    3: "³ Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills\
      \ someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities. \n"
    4: '⁴ This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for
      safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. '
    5: '⁵ For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood,
      and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor
      and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. '
    6: '⁶ Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him
      if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of
      death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. '
    7: "⁷ This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities. \n"
    8: '⁸ If the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to
      your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them, '
    9: '⁹ because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love
      the Lord your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set
      aside three more cities. '
    10: "¹⁰ Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not\
      \ be guilty of bloodshed. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor,
      and then flees to one of these cities, '
    12: '¹² the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from
      the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. '
    13: "¹³ Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent\
      \ blood, so that it may go well with you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors\
      \ in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you\
      \ to possess. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense\
      \ they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of\
      \ two or three witnesses. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, '
    17: '¹⁷ the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the
      Lord before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. '
    18: '¹⁸ The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves
      to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, '
    19: '¹⁹ then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other
      party. You must purge the evil from among you. '
    20: '²⁰ The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again
      will such an evil thing be done among you. '
    21: '²¹ Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
      foot for foot.'
  20:
    1: '¹ When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and
      an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your
      God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you. '
    2: '² When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and
      address the army. '
    3: '³ He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your
      enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. '
    4: "⁴ For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against\
      \ your enemies to give you victory.” \n"
    5: '⁵ The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not
      yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone
      else may begin to live in it. '
    6: '⁶ Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home,
      or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it. '
    7: '⁷ Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home,
      or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.” '
    8: '⁸ Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him
      go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.” '
    9: "⁹ When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint\
      \ commanders over it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. '
    11: '¹¹ If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject
      to forced labor and shall work for you. '
    12: '¹² If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege
      to that city. '
    13: '¹³ When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all
      the men in it. '
    14: '¹⁴ As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the
      city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder
      the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. '
    15: "¹⁵ This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from\
      \ you and do not belong to the nations nearby. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you
      as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. '
    17: '¹⁷ Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
      Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you. '
    18: "¹⁸ Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they\
      \ do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture
      it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their
      fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them? '
    20: ²⁰ However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use
      them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
  21:
    1: '¹ If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the Lord your God
      is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer was, '
    2: '² your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body
      to the neighboring towns. '
    3: '³ Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has
      never been worked and has never worn a yoke '
    4: '⁴ and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where
      there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s
      neck. '
    5: '⁵ The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the Lord your God has chosen
      them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the Lord and to decide
      all cases of dispute and assault. '
    6: '⁶ Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands
      over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, '
    7: '⁷ and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our
      eyes see it done. '
    8: '⁸ Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, Lord,
      and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.” Then
      the bloodshed will be atoned for, '
    9: "⁹ and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent\
      \ blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers
      them into your hands and you take captives, '
    11: '¹¹ if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to
      her, you may take her as your wife. '
    12: '¹² Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails '
    13: '¹³ and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has
      lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then
      you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. '
    14: "¹⁴ If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must\
      \ not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear
      him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love, '
    16: '¹⁶ when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of
      the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn,
      the son of the wife he does not love. '
    17: "¹⁷ He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving\
      \ him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s\
      \ strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father
      and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, '
    19: '¹⁹ his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders
      at the gate of his town. '
    20: '²⁰ They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious.
      He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” '
    21: "²¹ Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge\
      \ the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid. \n"
    22: '²² If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body
      is exposed on a pole, '
    23: ²³ you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury
      it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse.
      You must not desecrate the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
  22:
    1: '¹ If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it
      but be sure to take it back to its owner. '
    2: '² If they do not live near you or if you do not know who owns it, take it
      home with you and keep it until they come looking for it. Then give it back. '

    6: '⁶ If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on
      the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take
      the mother with the young. '

      time of prosperity, '
    48: "⁴⁸ therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will\
      \ serve the enemies the Lord sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on\
      \ your neck until he has destroyed you. \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends
      of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will
      not understand, '
    50: '⁵⁰ a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. '
    51: '⁵¹ They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land
      until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil,
      nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. '
    52: "⁵² They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high\
      \ fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities\
      \ throughout the land the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    53: '⁵³ Because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege,
      you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the
      Lord your God has given you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion
      on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, '
    55: '⁵⁵ and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that
      he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy
      will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. '
    56: '⁵⁶ The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle
      that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will
      begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter '
    57: "⁵⁷ the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire\
      \ need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy\
      \ will inflict on you during the siege of your cities. \n"
    58: '⁵⁸ If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written
      in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the Lord your
      God— '
    59: '⁵⁹ the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh
      and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. '
    60: '⁶⁰ He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they
      will cling to you. '
    61: '⁶¹ The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not
      recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. '
    62: '⁶² You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few
      in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God. '
    63: "⁶³ Just as it pleased the Lord to make you prosper and increase in number,\
      \ so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the\
      \ land you are entering to possess. \n"
    64: '⁶⁴ Then the Lord will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the
      earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone,
      which neither you nor your ancestors have known. '
    65: '⁶⁵ Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the
      sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary
      with longing, and a despairing heart. '
    66: '⁶⁶ You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day,
      never sure of your life. '
    67: '⁶⁷ In the morning you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening,
      “If only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your hearts
      and the sights that your eyes will see. '
    68: ⁶⁸ The Lord will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should
      never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as
      male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
  29:
    1: "¹ These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with\
      \ the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them\
      \ at Horeb. \n"
    2: "² Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them:\nYour eyes have seen\
      \ all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all\
      \ his land. "
    3: '³ With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders. '
    4: '⁴ But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes
      that see or ears that hear. '
    5: '⁵ Yet the Lord says, “During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness,
      your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet. '
    6: "⁶ You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this\
      \ so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan
      came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. '
    8: "⁸ We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the\
      \ Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh. \n"
    9: '⁹ Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in
      everything you do. '
    10: '¹⁰ All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God—your
      leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, '
    11: '¹¹ together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living
      in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. '
    12: '¹² You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord
      your God, a covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an
      oath, '
    13: '¹³ to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised
      you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. '
    14: '¹⁴ I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you '
    15: "¹⁵ who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God\
      \ but also with those who are not here today. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the
      countries on the way here. '
    17: '¹⁷ You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone,
      of silver and gold. '
    18: "¹⁸ Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose\
      \ heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those\
      \ nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing
      on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my
      own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will
      burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and
      the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven. '
    21: "²¹ The Lord will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster,\
      \ according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come
      from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and
      the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it. '
    23: '²³ The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted,
      nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction
      of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the Lord overthrew in fierce
      anger. '
    24: "²⁴ All the nations will ask: “Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why\
      \ this fierce, burning anger?” \n"
    25: '²⁵ And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant
      of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when
      he brought them out of Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they
      did not know, gods he had not given them. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore the Lord’s anger burned against this land, so that he brought
      on it all the curses written in this book. '
    28: "²⁸ In furious anger and in great wrath the Lord uprooted them from their\
      \ land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.” \n"
    29: ²⁹ The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong
      to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this
      law.
  30:
    1: '¹ When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and
      you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations, '
    2: '² and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey him
      with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command
      you today, '
    3: '³ then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on
      you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you. '
    4: '⁴ Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens,
      from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back. '
    5: '⁵ He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will
      take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your
      ancestors. '
    6: '⁶ The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants,
      so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and
      persecute you. '
    8: '⁸ You will again obey the Lord and follow all his commands I am giving you
      today. '
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of
      your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the
      crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous,
      just as he delighted in your ancestors, '
    10: "¹⁰ if you obey the Lord your God and keep his commands and decrees that are\
      \ written in this Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your\
      \ heart and with all your soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond
      your reach. '
    12: '¹² It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into
      heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” '
    13: '¹³ Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the
      sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” '
    14: "¹⁴ No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so\
      \ you may obey it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. '
    16: "¹⁶ For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience\
      \ to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and\
      \ increase, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering\
      \ to possess. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are
      drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, '
    18: "¹⁸ I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will\
      \ not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that
      I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life,
      so that you and your children may live '
    20: ²⁰ and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to his voice, and hold
      fast to him. For the Lord is your life, and he will give you many years in the
      land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
  31:
    1: '¹ Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel: '
    2: '² “I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead
      you. The Lord has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’ '
    3: '³ The Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy
      these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua
      also will cross over ahead of you, as the Lord said. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the
      Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have
      commanded you. '
    6: "⁶ Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them,\
      \ for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel,
      “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that
      the Lord swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among
      them as their inheritance. '
    8: "⁸ The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave\
      \ you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried
      the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses commanded them: “At the end of every seven years, in the year
      for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, '
    11: '¹¹ when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place
      he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing. '
    12: '¹² Assemble the people—men, women and children, and the foreigners residing
      in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow
      carefully all the words of this law. '
    13: "¹³ Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear\
      \ the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan\
      \ to possess.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord said to Moses, “Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua\
      \ and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him.”\
      \ So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud
      stood over the entrance to the tent. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the Lord said to Moses: “You are going to rest with your ancestors,
      and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the
      land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with
      them. '
    17: '¹⁷ And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will
      hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities
      will come on them, and in that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters
      come on us because our God is not with us?’ '
    18: "¹⁸ And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness\
      \ in turning to other gods. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them
      sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them. '
    20: '²⁰ When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the
      land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and
      thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking
      my covenant. '
    21: '²¹ And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify
      against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know
      what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised
      them on oath.” '
    22: "²² So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ The Lord gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and courageous,\
      \ for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and\
      \ I myself will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning
      to end, '
    25: '²⁵ he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord: '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness against you. '
    27: '²⁷ For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious
      against the Lord while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you
      rebel after I die! '
    28: '²⁸ Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials,
      so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the
      earth to testify against them. '
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt\
      \ and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will\
      \ fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and arouse his\
      \ anger by what your hands have made.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the
      hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:'
  32:
    1: "¹ Listen, you heavens, and I will speak;\n    hear, you earth, the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    2: "² Let my teaching fall like rain\n    and my words descend like dew,\nlike\
      \ showers on new grass,\n    like abundant rain on tender plants. \n"
    3: "³ I will proclaim the name of the Lord.\n    Oh, praise the greatness of our\
      \ God!\n"
    4: "⁴ He is the Rock, his works are perfect,\n    and all his ways are just.\n\
      A faithful God who does no wrong,\n    upright and just is he. \n"
    5: "⁵ They are corrupt and not his children;\n    to their shame they are a warped\
      \ and crooked generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is this the way you repay the Lord,\n    you foolish and unwise people?\n\
      Is he not your Father, your Creator,\n    who made you and formed you? \n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of old;\n    consider the generations long past.\nAsk\
      \ your father and he will tell you,\n    your elders, and they will explain\
      \ to you.\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,\n    when he divided\
      \ all mankind,\nhe set up boundaries for the peoples\n    according to the number\
      \ of the sons of Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ For the Lord’s portion is his people,\n    Jacob his allotted inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ In a desert land he found him,\n    in a barren and howling waste.\nHe\
      \ shielded him and cared for him;\n    he guarded him as the apple of his eye,\n"
    11: "¹¹ like an eagle that stirs up its nest\n    and hovers over its young,\n\
      that spreads its wings to catch them\n    and carries them aloft.\n"
    12: "¹² The Lord alone led him;\n    no foreign god was with him. \n"
    13: "¹³ He made him ride on the heights of the land\n    and fed him with the\
      \ fruit of the fields.\nHe nourished him with honey from the rock,\n    and\
      \ with oil from the flinty crag,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with curds and milk from herd and flock\n    and with fattened lambs and\
      \ goats,\nwith choice rams of Bashan\n    and the finest kernels of wheat.\n\
      You drank the foaming blood of the grape. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Jeshurun grew fat and kicked;\n    filled with food, they became heavy\
      \ and sleek.\nThey abandoned the God who made them\n    and rejected the Rock\
      \ their Savior.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They made him jealous with their foreign gods\n    and angered him with\
      \ their detestable idols.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—\n    gods they had not\
      \ known,\n    gods that recently appeared,\n    gods your ancestors did not\
      \ fear.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ You deserted the Rock, who fathered you;\n    you forgot the God who gave\
      \ you birth. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord saw this and rejected them\n    because he was angered by his\
      \ sons and daughters.\n"
    20: "²⁰ “I will hide my face from them,” he said,\n    “and see what their end\
      \ will be;\nfor they are a perverse generation,\n    children who are unfaithful.\n"
    21: "²¹ They made me jealous by what is no god\n    and angered me with their\
      \ worthless idols.\nI will make them envious by those who are not a people;\n\
      \    I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.\n"
    22: "²² For a fire will be kindled by my wrath,\n    one that burns down to the\
      \ realm of the dead below.\nIt will devour the earth and its harvests\n    and\
      \ set afire the foundations of the mountains. \n"
    23: "²³ “I will heap calamities on them\n    and spend my arrows against them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I will send wasting famine against them,\n    consuming pestilence and\
      \ deadly plague;\nI will send against them the fangs of wild beasts,\n    the\
      \ venom of vipers that glide in the dust.\n"
    25: "²⁵ In the street the sword will make them childless;\n    in their homes\
      \ terror will reign.\nThe young men and young women will perish,\n    the infants\
      \ and those with gray hair.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I said I would scatter them\n    and erase their name from human memory,\n"
    27: "²⁷ but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy,\n    lest the adversary misunderstand\n\
      and say, ‘Our hand has triumphed;\n    the Lord has not done all this.’” \n"
    28: "²⁸ They are a nation without sense,\n    there is no discernment in them.\n"
    29: "²⁹ If only they were wise and would understand this\n    and discern what\

    30: "³⁰ How could one man chase a thousand,\n    or two put ten thousand to flight,\n\
      unless their Rock had sold them,\n    unless the Lord had given them up?\n"
    31: "³¹ For their rock is not like our Rock,\n    as even our enemies concede.\n"
    32: "³² Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom\n    and from the fields of Gomorrah.\n\
      Their grapes are filled with poison,\n    and their clusters with bitterness.\n"
    33: "³³ Their wine is the venom of serpents,\n    the deadly poison of cobras.\

    34: "³⁴ “Have I not kept this in reserve\n    and sealed it in my vaults?\n"
    35: "³⁵ It is mine to avenge; I will repay.\n    In due time their foot will slip;\n\
      their day of disaster is near\n    and their doom rushes upon them.” \n"
    36: "³⁶ The Lord will vindicate his people\n    and relent concerning his servants\n\
      when he sees their strength is gone\n    and no one is left, slave or free.\n"
    37: "³⁷ He will say: “Now where are their gods,\n    the rock they took refuge\
      \ in,\n"
    38: "³⁸ the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices\n    and drank the wine of\
      \ their drink offerings?\nLet them rise up to help you!\n    Let them give you\

    39: "³⁹ “See now that I myself am he!\n    There is no god besides me.\nI put\

    1: '¹ Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah,
      across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the whole land—from Gilead to
      Dan, '
    2: '² all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of
      Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, '
    3: '³ the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms,
      as far as Zoar. '
    4: "⁴ Then the Lord said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham,\
