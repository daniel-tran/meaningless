Revelation:
  1:
    1: 'The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants
      what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant
      John, '
    2: '² who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony
      of Jesus Christ. '
    3: "³ Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed\
      \ are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the\
      \ time is near. \n"
    4: "⁴ John,\nTo the seven churches in the province of Asia:\nGrace and peace to\
      \ you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits\
      \ before his throne, "
    5: "⁵ and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the\
      \ dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.\nTo him who loves us and has\
      \ freed us from our sins by his blood, "
    6: "⁶ and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to\
      \ him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Look, he is coming with the clouds,”\n    and “every eye will see him,\n\
      even those who pierced him”;\n    and all peoples on earth “will mourn because\
      \ of him.”\nSo shall it be! Amen. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was,\
      \ and who is to come, the Almighty.” \n"
    9: '⁹ I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient
      endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the
      word of God and the testimony of Jesus. '
    10: '¹⁰ On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice
      like a trumpet, '
    11: "¹¹ which said: “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches:\
      \ to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned
      I saw seven golden lampstands, '
    13: '¹³ and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe
      reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. '
    14: '¹⁴ The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes
      were like blazing fire. '
    15: '¹⁵ His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like
      the sound of rushing waters. '
    16: "¹⁶ In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was\
      \ a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its\
      \ brilliance. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his
      right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. '
    18: "¹⁸ I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and\
      \ ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take
      place later. '
    20: '²⁰ The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the
      seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven
      churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.'
  2:
    1: "“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:\nThese are the words of him\
      \ who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden\
      \ lampstands. "
    2: '² I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you
      cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles
      but are not, and have found them false. '
    3: "³ You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not\
      \ grown weary. \n"
    4: '⁴ Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first. '
    5: '⁵ Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first.
      If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its
      place. '
    6: "⁶ But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans,\
      \ which I also hate. \n"
    7: "⁷ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To\
      \ the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life,\
      \ which is in the paradise of God. \n"
    8: "⁸ “To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:\nThese are the words of him\
      \ who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again. "
    9: '⁹ I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about
      the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue
      of Satan. '
    10: "¹⁰ Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil\
      \ will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution\
      \ for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you\
      \ life as your victor’s crown. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\
      \ The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death. \n"
    12: "¹² “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:\nThese are the words of\
      \ him who has the sharp, double-edged sword. "
    13: "¹³ I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true\
      \ to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of\
      \ Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan\
      \ lives. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you
      who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites
      to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality. '
    15: '¹⁵ Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. '
    16: "¹⁶ Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against\
      \ them with the sword of my mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\
      \ To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will\
      \ also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only\
      \ to the one who receives it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:\nThese are the words of\
      \ the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished\
      \ bronze. "
    19: "¹⁹ I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance,\
      \ and that you are now doing more than you did at first. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel,
      who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual
      immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. '
    21: '²¹ I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. '
    22: '²² So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit
      adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. '
    23: "²³ I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that\
      \ I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according\
      \ to your deeds. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her
      teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose
      any other burden on you, '
    25: "²⁵ except to hold on to what you have until I come.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give
      authority over the nations— '
    27: '²⁷ that one ‘will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces
      like pottery’—just as I have received authority from my Father. '
    28: '²⁸ I will also give that one the morning star. '
    29: ²⁹ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
  3:
    1: "“To the angel of the church in Sardis write:\nThese are the words of him who\
      \ holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you\
      \ have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. "
    2: '² Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your
      deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. '
    3: "³ Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and\
      \ repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will\
      \ not know at what time I will come to you. \n"
    4: '⁴ Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They
      will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. '
    5: '⁵ The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never
      blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge
      that name before my Father and his angels. '
    6: "⁶ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. \n"
    7: "⁷ “To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:\nThese are the words\
      \ of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no\
      \ one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. "
    8: '⁸ I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one
      can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and
      have not denied my name. '
    9: '⁹ I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews
      though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your
      feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. '
    10: "¹⁰ Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you\
      \ from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the\
      \ inhabitants of the earth. \n"
    11: '¹¹ I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your
      crown. '
    12: '¹² The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God.
      Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and
      the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out
      of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name. '
    13: "¹³ Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:\nThese are the words of\
      \ the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. "
    15: '¹⁵ I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were
      either one or the other! '
    16: '¹⁶ So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you
      out of my mouth. '
    17: '¹⁷ You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’
      But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. '
    18: "¹⁸ I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become\
      \ rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness;\
      \ and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent. '
    20: "²⁰ Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and\
      \ opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on
      my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. '
    22: ²² Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
  4:
    1: 'After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven.
      And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up
      here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” '
    2: '² At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven
      with someone sitting on it. '
    3: '³ And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow
      that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. '
    4: '⁴ Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them
      were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on
      their heads. '
    5: '⁵ From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder.
      In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits
      of God. '
    6: "⁶ Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear\
      \ as crystal.\nIn the center, around the throne, were four living creatures,\
      \ and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. "
    7: '⁷ The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the
      third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. '
    8: "⁸ Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes\
      \ all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying:\n\
      “‘Holy, holy, holy\nis the Lord God Almighty,’\nwho was, and is, and is to come.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits
      on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, '
    10: "¹⁰ the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and\
      \ worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the\
      \ throne and say: \n"
    11: "¹¹ “You are worthy, our Lord and God,\n    to receive glory and honor and\
      \ power,\nfor you created all things,\n    and by your will they were created\n\
      \    and have their being.”"
  5:
    1: 'Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing
      on both sides and sealed with seven seals. '
    2: '² And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to
      break the seals and open the scroll?” '
    3: '³ But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll
      or even look inside it. '
    4: '⁴ I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll
      or look inside. '
    5: "⁵ Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe\
      \ of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll\
      \ and its seven seals.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center
      of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb
      had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out
      into all the earth. '
    7: '⁷ He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. '
    8: '⁸ And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four
      elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding
      golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. '
    9: "⁹ And they sang a new song, saying:\n“You are worthy to take the scroll\n\
      \    and to open its seals,\nbecause you were slain,\n    and with your blood\
      \ you purchased for God\n    persons from every tribe and language and people\
      \ and nation.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God,\n   \
      \ and they will reign on the earth.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands
      upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne
      and the living creatures and the elders. '
    12: "¹² In a loud voice they were saying:\n“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,\n\
      \    to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength\n    and honor and\
      \ glory and praise!” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth\
      \ and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying:\n“To him who sits on the\
      \ throne and to the Lamb\n    be praise and honor and glory and power,\nfor\
      \ ever and ever!” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
  6:
    1: 'I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one
      of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!” '
    2: "² I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and\
      \ he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. \n"
    3: '³ When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature
      say, “Come!” '
    4: "⁴ Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power\
      \ to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was\
      \ given a large sword. \n"
    5: '⁵ When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say,
      “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding
      a pair of scales in his hand. '
    6: "⁶ Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures,\
      \ saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for\
      \ a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!” \n"
    7: '⁷ When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living
      creature say, “Come!” '
    8: "⁸ I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death,\
      \ and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth\
      \ of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of\
      \ the earth. \n"
    9: '⁹ When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those
      who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. '
    10: '¹⁰ They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true,
      until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” '
    11: "¹¹ Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a\
      \ little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers\
      \ and sisters, were killed just as they had been. \n"
    12: '¹² I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The
      sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood
      red, '
    13: '¹³ and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when
      shaken by a strong wind. '
    14: "¹⁴ The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain\
      \ and island was removed from its place. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the
      mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks
      of the mountains. '
    16: '¹⁶ They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from
      the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! '
    17: ¹⁷ For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”
  7:
    1: 'After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding
      back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land
      or on the sea or on any tree. '
    2: '² Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the
      living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given
      power to harm the land and the sea: '
    3: '³ “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the
      foreheads of the servants of our God.” '
    4: "⁴ Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    5: "⁵ From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,\nfrom the tribe of Reuben 12,000,\n\
      from the tribe of Gad 12,000, \n"
    6: "⁶ from the tribe of Asher 12,000,\nfrom the tribe of Naphtali 12,000,\nfrom\
      \ the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, \n"
    7: "⁷ from the tribe of Simeon 12,000,\nfrom the tribe of Levi 12,000,\nfrom the\
      \ tribe of Issachar 12,000, \n"
    8: "⁸ from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000,\nfrom the tribe of Joseph 12,000,\nfrom\
      \ the tribe of Benjamin 12,000. \n"
    9: '⁹ After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one
      could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before
      the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding
      palm branches in their hands. '
    10: "¹⁰ And they cried out in a loud voice:\n“Salvation belongs to our God,\n\
      who sits on the throne,\nand to the Lamb.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and
      the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and
      worshiped God, '
    12: "¹² saying:\n“Amen!\nPraise and glory\nand wisdom and thanks and honor\nand\
      \ power and strength\nbe to our God for ever and ever.\nAmen!” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and\
      \ where did they come from?” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I answered, “Sir, you know.”\nAnd he said, “These are they who have come\
      \ out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white\
      \ in the blood of the Lamb. "
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore,\n“they are before the throne of God\n    and serve him day\
      \ and night in his temple;\nand he who sits on the throne\n    will shelter\
      \ them with his presence.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Never again will they hunger;\n    never again will they thirst.\nThe\
      \ sun will not beat down on them,’\n    nor any scorching heat.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the Lamb at the center of the throne\n    will be their shepherd;\n\
      ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’\n    ‘And God will wipe away\
      \ every tear from their eyes.’”"
  8:
    1: "When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half\
      \ an hour. \n"
    2: "² And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were\
      \ given to them. \n"
    3: '³ Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He
      was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the
      golden altar in front of the throne. '
    4: '⁴ The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went
      up before God from the angel’s hand. '
    5: "⁵ Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and\
      \ hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes\
      \ of lightning and an earthquake. \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed\
      \ with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was\
      \ burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was\
      \ burned up. \n"
    8: '⁸ The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain,
      all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, '
    9: "⁹ a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships\
      \ were destroyed. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a
      torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— '
    11: "¹¹ the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter,\
      \ and many people died from the waters that had become bitter. \n"
    12: "¹² The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck,\
      \ a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned\
      \ dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a
      loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet
      blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”'
  9:
    1: 'The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from
      the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. '
    2: '² When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic
      furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. '
    3: '³ And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power
      like that of scorpions of the earth. '
    4: '⁴ They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree,
      but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. '
    5: '⁵ They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months.
      And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it
      strikes. '
    6: "⁶ During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will\
      \ long to die, but death will elude them. \n"
    7: '⁷ The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they
      wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. '
    8: '⁸ Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. '
    9: '⁹ They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their
      wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. '
    10: '¹⁰ They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they
      had power to torment people for five months. '
    11: "¹¹ They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew\
      \ is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer). \n"
    12: "¹² The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come. \n"
    13: '¹³ The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the
      four horns of the golden altar that is before God. '
    14: '¹⁴ It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels
      who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” '
    15: '¹⁵ And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day
      and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. '
    16: "¹⁶ The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand.\
      \ I heard their number. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates
      were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled
      the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur. '
    18: '¹⁸ A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and
      sulfur that came out of their mouths. '
    19: "¹⁹ The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their\
      \ tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not
      repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and
      idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear
      or walk. '
    21: ²¹ Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality
      or their thefts.
  10:
    1: 'Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a
      cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs
      were like fiery pillars. '
    2: '² He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his
      right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, '
    3: '³ and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices
      of the seven thunders spoke. '
    4: "⁴ And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice\
      \ from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write\
      \ it down.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his
      right hand to heaven. '
    6: '⁶ And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens
      and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all
      that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay! '
    7: "⁷ But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the\
      \ mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants\
      \ the prophets.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go,\
      \ take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on\
      \ the sea and on the land.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said
      to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth
      it will be as sweet as honey.’” '
    10: '¹⁰ I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as
      sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour. '
    11: ¹¹ Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations,
      languages and kings.”
  11:
    1: 'I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the
      temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. '
    2: '² But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given
      to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. '
    3: '³ And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days,
      clothed in sackcloth.” '
    4: '⁴ They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before
      the Lord of the earth.” '
    5: '⁵ If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their
      enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. '
    6: "⁶ They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the\
      \ time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood\
      \ and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from
      the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. '
    8: '⁸ Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively
      called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. '
    9: '⁹ For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation
      will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. '
    10: "¹⁰ The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by\
      \ sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who\
      \ live on the earth. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered
      them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. '
    12: "¹² Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.”\
      \ And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on. \n"
    13: "¹³ At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city\
      \ collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors\
      \ were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven,\
      \ which said:\n“The kingdom of the world has become\n    the kingdom of our\
      \ Lord and of his Messiah,\n    and he will reign for ever and ever.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God,
      fell on their faces and worshiped God, '
    17: "¹⁷ saying:\n“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,\n    the One who is\
      \ and who was,\nbecause you have taken your great power\n    and have begun\
      \ to reign.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The nations were angry,\n    and your wrath has come.\nThe time has come\
      \ for judging the dead,\n    and for rewarding your servants the prophets\n\
      and your people who revere your name,\n    both great and small—\nand for destroying\
      \ those who destroy the earth.” \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen
      the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals
      of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
  12:
    1: 'A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon
      under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. '
    2: '² She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. '
    3: '³ Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven
      heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. '
    4: '⁴ Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the
      earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so
      that it might devour her child the moment he was born. '
    5: '⁵ She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with
      an iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. '
    6: "⁶ The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where\
      \ she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the
      dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. '
    8: '⁸ But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. '
    9: "⁹ The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil,\
      \ or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and\
      \ his angels with him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:\n“Now have come the salvation\
      \ and the power\n    and the kingdom of our God,\n    and the authority of his\
      \ Messiah.\nFor the accuser of our brothers and sisters,\n    who accuses them\
      \ before our God day and night,\n    has been hurled down.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They triumphed over him\n    by the blood of the Lamb\n    and by the\
      \ word of their testimony;\nthey did not love their lives so much\n    as to\
      \ shrink from death.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore rejoice, you heavens\n    and you who dwell in them!\nBut woe\
      \ to the earth and the sea,\n    because the devil has gone down to you!\nHe\
      \ is filled with fury,\n    because he knows that his time is short.” \n"
    13: '¹³ When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the
      woman who had given birth to the male child. '
    14: '¹⁴ The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might
      fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken
      care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake
      the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. '
    16: '¹⁶ But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the
      river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against
      the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their
      testimony about Jesus.
  13:
    1: 'The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of
      the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and
      on each head a blasphemous name. '
    2: '² The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and
      a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne
      and great authority. '
    3: '³ One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the
      fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed
      the beast. '
    4: "⁴ People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast,\
      \ and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can\
      \ wage war against it?” \n"
    5: '⁵ The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to
      exercise its authority for forty-two months. '
    6: '⁶ It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling
      place and those who live in heaven. '
    7: '⁷ It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer
      them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. '
    8: "⁸ All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have\
      \ not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the\
      \ creation of the world. \n"
    9: "⁹ Whoever has ears, let them hear. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “If anyone is to go into captivity,\n    into captivity they will go.\n\
      If anyone is to be killed with the sword,\n    with the sword they will be killed.”\n\
      This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like
      a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. '
    12: '¹² It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made
      the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had
      been healed. '
    13: '¹³ And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven
      to the earth in full view of the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first
      beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an
      image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. '
    15: '¹⁵ The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first
      beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the
      image to be killed. '
    16: '¹⁶ It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave,
      to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, '
    17: "¹⁷ so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is\
      \ the name of the beast or the number of its name. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number
      of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
  14:
    1: 'Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and
      with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. '
    2: '² And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like
      a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing
      their harps. '
    3: '³ And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures
      and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been
      redeemed from the earth. '
    4: '⁴ These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained
      virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among
      mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. '
    5: "⁵ No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel
      to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language
      and people. '
    7: "⁷ He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour\
      \ of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the\
      \ sea and the springs of water.” \n"
    8: "⁸ A second angel followed and said, “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’\
      \ which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.” \n"
    9: '⁹ A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships
      the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their
      hand, '
    10: '¹⁰ they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full
      strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur
      in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. '
    11: '¹¹ And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will
      be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for
      anyone who receives the mark of its name.” '
    12: "¹² This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who\
      \ keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus. \n"
    13: "¹³ Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead\
      \ who die in the Lord from now on.”\n“Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest\
      \ from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud
      was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle
      in his hand. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to
      him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time
      to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and\
      \ the earth was harvested. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp
      sickle. '
    18: '¹⁸ Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and
      called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle
      and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes
      are ripe.” '
    19: '¹⁹ The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw
      them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. '
    20: ²⁰ They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed
      out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600
      stadia.
  15:
    1: 'I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven
      last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed. '
    2: '² And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing
      beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and
      over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God '
    3: "³ and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb:\n“Great and marvelous\
      \ are your deeds,\n    Lord God Almighty.\nJust and true are your ways,\n  \
      \  King of the nations.\n"
    4: "⁴ Who will not fear you, Lord,\n    and bring glory to your name?\nFor you\
      \ alone are holy.\nAll nations will come\n    and worship before you,\nfor your\
      \ righteous acts have been revealed.” \n"
    5: '⁵ After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle
      of the covenant law—and it was opened. '
    6: '⁶ Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were
      dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests. '
    7: '⁷ Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden
      bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever. '
    8: ⁸ And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power,
      and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels
      were completed.
  16:
    1: "Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go,\
      \ pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.” \n"
    2: "² The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering\
      \ sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped\
      \ its image. \n"
    3: "³ The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood\
      \ like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died. \n"
    4: '⁴ The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water,
      and they became blood. '
    5: "⁵ Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say:\n“You are just in these\
      \ judgments, O Holy One,\n    you who are and who were;\n"
    6: "⁶ for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets,\n  \
      \  and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.” \n"
    7: "⁷ And I heard the altar respond:\n“Yes, Lord God Almighty,\n    true and just\
      \ are your judgments.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed
      to scorch people with fire. '
    9: "⁹ They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who\
      \ had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its
      kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony '
    11: "¹¹ and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but\
      \ they refused to repent of what they had done. \n"
    12: '¹² The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and
      its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. '
    13: '¹³ Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out
      of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth
      of the false prophet. '
    14: "¹⁴ They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings\
      \ of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God\
      \ Almighty. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains\
      \ clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called\
      \ Armageddon. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple
      came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and
      a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has
      been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. '
    19: '¹⁹ The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed.
      God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of
      the fury of his wrath. '
    20: '²⁰ Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. '
    21: ²¹ From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell
      on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the
      plague was so terrible.
  17:
    1: 'One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come,
      I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters. '
    2: "² With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants\
      \ of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.” \n"
    3: '³ Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I
      saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names
      and had seven heads and ten horns. '
    4: '⁴ The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold,
      precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable
      things and the filth of her adulteries. '
    5: "⁵ The name written on her forehead was a mystery:\nbabylon the great\nthe\
      \ mother of prostitutes\nand of the abominations of the earth. \n"
    6: "⁶ I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the\
      \ blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus.\nWhen I saw her, I was greatly\
      \ astonished. "
    7: '⁷ Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you
      the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads
      and ten horns. '
    8: "⁸ The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out\
      \ of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose\
      \ names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world\
      \ will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not,\
      \ and yet will come. \n"
    9: '⁹ “This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which
      the woman sits. '
    10: '¹⁰ They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not
      yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while. '
    11: "¹¹ The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs\
      \ to the seven and is going to his destruction. \n"
    12: '¹² “The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom,
      but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. '
    13: '¹³ They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. '
    14: "¹⁴ They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them\
      \ because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called,\
      \ chosen and faithful followers.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits,
      are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. '
    16: '¹⁶ The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will
      bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her
      with fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing
      to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled. '
    18: ¹⁸ The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
  18:
    1: 'After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority,
      and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. '
    2: "² With a mighty voice he shouted:\n“‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’\n\
      \    She has become a dwelling for demons\nand a haunt for every impure spirit,\n\
      \    a haunt for every unclean bird,\n    a haunt for every unclean and detestable\
      \ animal.\n"
    3: "³ For all the nations have drunk\n    the maddening wine of her adulteries.\n\
      The kings of the earth committed adultery with her,\n    and the merchants of\
      \ the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I heard another voice from heaven say:\n“‘Come out of her, my people,’\n\
      \    so that you will not share in her sins,\n    so that you will not receive\
      \ any of her plagues;\n"
    5: "⁵ for her sins are piled up to heaven,\n    and God has remembered her crimes.\n"
    6: "⁶ Give back to her as she has given;\n    pay her back double for what she\
      \ has done.\n    Pour her a double portion from her own cup.\n"
    7: "⁷ Give her as much torment and grief\n    as the glory and luxury she gave\
      \ herself.\nIn her heart she boasts,\n    ‘I sit enthroned as queen.\nI am not\
      \ a widow;\n    I will never mourn.’\n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:\n    death, mourning\
      \ and famine.\nShe will be consumed by fire,\n    for mighty is the Lord God\
      \ who judges her. \n"
    9: '⁹ “When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared
      her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. '
    10: "¹⁰ Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry:\n“‘Woe! Woe\
      \ to you, great city,\n    you mighty city of Babylon!\nIn one hour your doom\
      \ has come!’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one
      buys their cargoes anymore— '
    12: '¹² cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple,
      silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind
      made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; '
    13: "¹³ cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of\
      \ wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and\
      \ carriages; and human beings sold as slaves. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury
      and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’ '
    15: '¹⁵ The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will
      stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn '
    16: "¹⁶ and cry out:\n“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,\n    dressed in fine linen,\
      \ purple and scarlet,\n    and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’\n“Every sea captain,\
      \ and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from\
      \ the sea, will stand far off. "
    18: '¹⁸ When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there
      ever a city like this great city?’ '
    19: "¹⁹ They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry\
      \ out:\n“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,\n    where all who had ships on the sea\n\
      \    became rich through her wealth!\nIn one hour she has been brought to ruin!’\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Rejoice over her, you heavens!\n    Rejoice, you people of God!\n   \
      \ Rejoice, apostles and prophets!\nFor God has judged her\n    with the judgment\
      \ she imposed on you.” \n"
    21: "²¹ Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone\
      \ and threw it into the sea, and said:\n“With such violence\n    the great city\
      \ of Babylon will be thrown down,\n    never to be found again.\n"
    22: "²² The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters,\n    will\
      \ never be heard in you again.\nNo worker of any trade\n    will ever be found\
      \ in you again.\nThe sound of a millstone\n    will never be heard in you again.\n"
    23: "²³ The light of a lamp\n    will never shine in you again.\nThe voice of\
      \ bridegroom and bride\n    will never be heard in you again.\nYour merchants\
      \ were the world’s important people.\n    By your magic spell all the nations\
      \ were led astray.\n"
    24: "²⁴ In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people,\n   \
      \ of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”"
  19:
    1: "After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven\
      \ shouting:\n“Hallelujah!\nSalvation and glory and power belong to our God,\n"
    2: "²     for true and just are his judgments.\nHe has condemned the great prostitute\n\
      \    who corrupted the earth by her adulteries.\nHe has avenged on her the blood\
      \ of his servants.” \n"
    3: "³ And again they shouted:\n“Hallelujah!\nThe smoke from her goes up for ever\
      \ and ever.” \n"
    4: "⁴ The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped\
      \ God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried:\n“Amen, Hallelujah!” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then a voice came from the throne, saying:\n“Praise our God,\n    all you\
      \ his servants,\nyou who fear him,\n    both great and small!” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing\
      \ waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting:\n“Hallelujah!\n    For our\
      \ Lord God Almighty reigns.\n"
    7: "⁷ Let us rejoice and be glad\n    and give him glory!\nFor the wedding of\
      \ the Lamb has come,\n    and his bride has made herself ready.\n"
    8: "⁸ Fine linen, bright and clean,\n    was given her to wear.”\n(Fine linen\
      \ stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.) \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited\
      \ to the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words\
      \ of God.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do\
      \ that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who\
      \ hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy\
      \ who bears testimony to Jesus.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose
      rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. '
    12: '¹² His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has
      a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. '
    13: '¹³ He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed
      in fine linen, white and clean. '
    15: '¹⁵ Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the
      nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of
      the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. '
    16: "¹⁶ On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written:\nking of kings\
      \ and lord of lords. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all
      the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, '
    18: "¹⁸ so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses\
      \ and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered
      together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. '
    20: '²⁰ But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed
      the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received
      the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive
      into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. '
    21: ²¹ The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider
      on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
  20:
    1: 'And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss
      and holding in his hand a great chain. '
    2: '² He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan,
      and bound him for a thousand years. '
    3: "³ He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep\
      \ him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.\
      \ After that, he must be set free for a short time. \n"
    4: '⁴ I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to
      judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony
      about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast
      or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.
      They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. '
    5: '⁵ (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were
      ended.) This is the first resurrection. '
    6: "⁶ Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second\
      \ death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ\
      \ and will reign with him for a thousand years. \n"
    7: '⁷ When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison '
    8: '⁸ and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog
      and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on
      the seashore. '
    9: '⁹ They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of
      God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured
      them. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning\
      \ sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be\
      \ tormented day and night for ever and ever. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth
      and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. '
    12: '¹² And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books
      were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were
      judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. '
    13: '¹³ The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up
      the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they
      had done. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire
      is the second death. '
    15: ¹⁵ Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown
      into the lake of fire.
  21:
    1: 'Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first
      earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. '
    2: '² I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
      prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. '
    3: '³ And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place
      is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people,
      and God himself will be with them and be their God. '
    4: "⁴ ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or\
      \ mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then\
      \ he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” \n"
    6: '⁶ He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning
      and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of
      the water of life. '
    7: '⁷ Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God
      and they will be my children. '
    8: "⁸ But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually\
      \ immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will\
      \ be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues
      came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and
      showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. '
    11: '¹¹ It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a
      very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. '
    12: '¹² It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at
      the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south
      and three on the west. '
    14: "¹⁴ The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names\
      \ of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the
      city, its gates and its walls. '
    16: '¹⁶ The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured
      the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide
      and high as it is long. '
    17: '¹⁷ The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits
      thick. '
    18: '¹⁸ The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. '
    19: '¹⁹ The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious
      stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate,
      the fourth emerald, '
    20: '²⁰ the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,
      the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth
      amethyst. '
    21: "²¹ The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl.\
      \ The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass. \n"
    22: '²² I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and
      the Lamb are its temple. '
    23: '²³ The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory
      of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. '
    24: '²⁴ The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring
      their splendor into it. '
    25: '²⁵ On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. '
    26: '²⁶ The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. '
    27: ²⁷ Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful
      or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
  22:
    1: 'Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal,
      flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb '
    2: '² down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river
      stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every

    3: '³ No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will
