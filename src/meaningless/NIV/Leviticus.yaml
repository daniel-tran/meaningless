Leviticus:
  1:
    1: 'The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said, '
    2: "² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When anyone among you brings\
      \ an offering to the Lord, bring as your offering an animal from either the\
      \ herd or the flock. \n"
    3: '³ “‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you are to offer a
      male without defect. You must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting
      so that it will be acceptable to the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ You are to lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will
      be accepted on your behalf to make atonement for you. '
    5: '⁵ You are to slaughter the young bull before the Lord, and then Aaron’s sons
      the priests shall bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar
      at the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ You are to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood
      on the fire. '
    8: '⁸ Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head
      and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. '
    9: "⁹ You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest\
      \ is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering,\
      \ an aroma pleasing to the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the
      sheep or the goats, you are to offer a male without defect. '
    11: '¹¹ You are to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the Lord,
      and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash its blood against the sides of the
      altar. '
    12: '¹² You are to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including
      the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. '
    13: "¹³ You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest\
      \ is to bring all of them and burn them on the altar. It is a burnt offering,\
      \ a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, you are to
      offer a dove or a young pigeon. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it
      on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. '
    16: '¹⁶ He is to remove the crop and the feathers and throw them down east of
      the altar where the ashes are. '
    17: ¹⁷ He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then
      the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt
      offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
  2:
    1: '“‘When anyone brings a grain offering to the Lord, their offering is to be
      of the finest flour. They are to pour olive oil on it, put incense on it '
    2: '² and take it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful
      of the flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial
      portion on the altar, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    3: "³ The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most\
      \ holy part of the food offerings presented to the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of the
      finest flour: either thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed
      in or thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with olive oil. '
    5: '⁵ If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it is to be made of the
      finest flour mixed with oil, and without yeast. '
    6: '⁶ Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. '
    7: '⁷ If your grain offering is cooked in a pan, it is to be made of the finest
      flour and some olive oil. '
    8: '⁸ Bring the grain offering made of these things to the Lord; present it to
      the priest, who shall take it to the altar. '
    9: '⁹ He shall take out the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn
      it on the altar as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a\
      \ most holy part of the food offerings presented to the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast,
      for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the
      Lord. '
    12: '¹² You may bring them to the Lord as an offering of the firstfruits, but
      they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma. '
    13: "¹³ Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the\
      \ covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, offer crushed
      heads of new grain roasted in the fire. '
    15: '¹⁵ Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain offering. '
    16: ¹⁶ The priest shall burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the
      oil, together with all the incense, as a food offering presented to the Lord.
  3:
    1: '“‘If your offering is a fellowship offering, and you offer an animal from
      the herd, whether male or female, you are to present before the Lord an animal
      without defect. '
    2: '² You are to lay your hand on the head of your offering and slaughter it at
      the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash
      the blood against the sides of the altar. '
    3: '³ From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord:
      the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them, '
    4: '⁴ both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the
      liver, which you will remove with the kidneys. '
    5: "⁵ Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering\
      \ that is lying on the burning wood; it is a food offering, an aroma pleasing\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘If you offer an animal from the flock as a fellowship offering to the
      Lord, you are to offer a male or female without defect. '
    7: '⁷ If you offer a lamb, you are to present it before the Lord, '
    8: '⁸ lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting.
      Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar. '
    9: '⁹ From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord:
      its fat, the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the internal organs
      and all the fat that is connected to them, '
    10: '¹⁰ both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of
      the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys. '
    11: "¹¹ The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “‘If your offering is a goat, you are to present it before the Lord, '
    13: '¹³ lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting.
      Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ From what you offer you are to present this food offering to the Lord:
      the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them, '
    15: '¹⁵ both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of
      the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys. '
    16: "¹⁶ The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing\
      \ aroma. All the fat is the Lord’s. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “‘This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you
      live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.’”'
  4:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Say to the Israelites: ‘When anyone sins unintentionally and does what\
      \ is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands— \n"
    3: '³ “‘If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring
      to the Lord a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has
      committed. '
    4: '⁴ He is to present the bull at the entrance to the tent of meeting before
      the Lord. He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it there before the
      Lord. '
    5: '⁵ Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and carry it
      into the tent of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times
      before the Lord, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ The priest shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of
      fragrant incense that is before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of
      the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering
      at the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    8: '⁸ He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—all the fat
      that is connected to the internal organs, '
    9: '⁹ both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the
      liver, which he will remove with the kidneys— '
    10: '¹⁰ just as the fat is removed from the ox sacrificed as a fellowship offering.
      Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering. '
    11: '¹¹ But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, as well as the head and legs,
      the internal organs and the intestines— '
    12: "¹² that is, all the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a place\
      \ ceremonially clean, where the ashes are thrown, and burn it there in a wood\
      \ fire on the ash heap. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what
      is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, even though the community is unaware
      of the matter, when they realize their guilt '
    14: '¹⁴ and the sin they committed becomes known, the assembly must bring a young
      bull as a sin offering and present it before the tent of meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head
      before the Lord, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then the anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood into the
      tent of meeting. '

      the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at
      the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ He shall remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar, '
    20: '²⁰ and do with this bull just as he did with the bull for the sin offering.
      In this way the priest will make atonement for the community, and they will
      be forgiven. '
    21: "²¹ Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned\
      \ the first bull. This is the sin offering for the community. \n"
    22: '²² “‘When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any
      of the commands of the Lord his God, when he realizes his guilt '

      a male goat without defect. '
    24: '²⁴ He is to lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place
      where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the Lord. It is a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with
      his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out
      the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. '
    26: "²⁶ He shall burn all the fat on the altar as he burned the fat of the fellowship\
      \ offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the leader’s sin,\
      \ and he will be forgiven. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “‘If any member of the community sins unintentionally and does what is
      forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, when they realize their guilt '

      offering for the sin they committed a female goat without defect. '
    29: '²⁹ They are to lay their hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter
      it at the place of the burnt offering. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the priest is to take some of the blood with his finger and put it
      on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood
      at the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the fellowship\
      \ offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to\
      \ the Lord. In this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will\
      \ be forgiven. \n"
    32: '³² “‘If someone brings a lamb as their sin offering, they are to bring a
      female without defect. '
    33: '³³ They are to lay their hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin offering
      at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. '
    34: '³⁴ Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with
      his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out
      the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ They shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the lamb
      of the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar on top
      of the food offerings presented to the Lord. In this way the priest will make
      atonement for them for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven.
  5:
    1: "“‘If anyone sins because they do not speak up when they hear a public charge\

      ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean. '
    12: '¹² The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every

    17: '¹⁷ Any meat of the sacrifice left over till the third day must be burned
      up. '
    18: "¹⁸ If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, the\
      \ one who offered it will not be accepted. It will not be reckoned to their\
      \ credit, for it has become impure; the person who eats any of it will be held\
      \ responsible. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “‘Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it
      must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it. '
    20: '²⁰ But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering
      belonging to the Lord, they must be cut off from their people. '
    21: "²¹ Anyone who touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean\
      \ animal or any unclean creature that moves along the ground—and then eats any\
      \ of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the Lord must be cut off\
      \ from their people.’” \n"
    22: '²² The Lord said to Moses, '
    23: '²³ “Say to the Israelites: ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or
      goats. '
    24: '²⁴ The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for
      any other purpose, but you must not eat it. '
    25: '²⁵ Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be
      presented to the Lord must be cut off from their people. '
    26: '²⁶ And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal. '
    27: "²⁷ Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.’” \n"
    28: '²⁸ The Lord said to Moses, '
    29: '²⁹ “Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the
      Lord is to bring part of it as their sacrifice to the Lord. '
    30: '³⁰ With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the Lord;
      they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before
      the Lord as a wave offering. '
    31: '³¹ The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to
      Aaron and his sons. '
    32: '³² You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest
      as a contribution. '
    33: '³³ The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering
      shall have the right thigh as his share. '
    34: "³⁴ From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast\
      \ that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron\
      \ the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.’” \n"
    35: '³⁵ This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the Lord that were
      allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the Lord
      as priests. '
    36: "³⁶ On the day they were anointed, the Lord commanded that the Israelites\
      \ give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come. \n"
    37: '³⁷ These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering,
      the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship
      offering, '
    38: ³⁸ which the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the
      day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord.
  8:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for
      the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without
      yeast, '
    3: '³ and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.” '
    4: "⁴ Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance\
      \ to the tent of meeting. \n"
    5: '⁵ Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.” '
    6: '⁶ Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the
      robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative
      waistband, which he tied around him. '
    8: '⁸ He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. '
    9: "⁹ Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred\
      \ emblem, on the front of it, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything
      in it, and so consecrated them. '
    11: '¹¹ He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar
      and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. '
    12: '¹² He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to
      consecrate him. '
    13: "¹³ Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes\
      \ around them and fastened caps on them, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on its head. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger
      he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the
      rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement
      for it. '
    16: '¹⁶ Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe
      of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. '
    17: "¹⁷ But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned\
      \ up outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on its head. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides
      of the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. '
    21: "²¹ He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole\
      \ ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering\
      \ presented to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    22: '²² He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron
      and his sons laid their hands on its head. '
    23: '²³ Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the
      lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe
      of his right foot. '
    24: '²⁴ Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the
      lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big
      toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar. '
    25: '²⁵ After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal
      organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right
      thigh. '
    26: '²⁶ And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the
      Lord, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one
      thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. '
    27: '²⁷ He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them
      before the Lord as a wave offering. '
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on
      top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food
      offering presented to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram,\
      \ and waved it before the Lord as a wave offering, as the Lord commanded Moses.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the\
      \ altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their\
      \ garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their\
      \ garments. \n"
    31: '³¹ Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance
      to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination
      offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ '
    32: '³² Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread. '
    33: '³³ Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until
      the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven
      days. '
    34: '³⁴ What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for
      you. '
    35: "³⁵ You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for\
      \ seven days and do what the Lord requires, so you will not die; for that is\
      \ what I have been commanded.” \n"
    36: ³⁶ So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord commanded through Moses.
  9:
    1: 'On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. '
    2: '² He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for
      your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then say to the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf
      and a lamb—both a year old and without defect—for a burnt offering, '
    4: "⁴ and an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the Lord,\
      \ together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the Lord will\
      \ appear to you.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting,
      and the entire assembly came near and stood before the Lord. '
    6: "⁶ Then Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded you to do, so that\
      \ the glory of the Lord may appear to you.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering\
      \ and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice\
      \ the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the Lord\
      \ has commanded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for
      himself. '
    9: '⁹ His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood
      and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at
      the base of the altar. '
    10: '¹⁰ On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver
      from the sin offering, as the Lord commanded Moses; '
    11: "¹¹ the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp. \n"
    12: '¹² Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood,
      and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. '
    13: '¹³ They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head,
      and he burned them on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the\
      \ burnt offering on the altar. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat\
      \ for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin\
      \ offering as he did with the first one. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way. '
    17: "¹⁷ He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it\
      \ on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people.
      His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. '
    19: '¹⁹ But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of
      fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver— '
    20: '²⁰ these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. '
    21: "²¹ Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the Lord as a wave\
      \ offering, as Moses commanded. \n"
    22: "²² Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having\
      \ sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering,\
      \ he stepped down. \n"
    23: '²³ Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out,
      they blessed the people; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. '
    24: ²⁴ Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering
      and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted
      for joy and fell facedown.
  10:
    1: 'Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added
      incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, contrary to his
      command. '
    2: '² So fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they
      died before the Lord. '
    3: "³ Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke of when he said:\n\
      “‘Among those who approach me\n    I will be proved holy;\nin the sight of all\
      \ the people\n    I will be honored.’”\nAaron remained silent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said
      to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front
      of the sanctuary.” '
    5: "⁵ So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp,\
      \ as Moses ordered. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your
      hair become unkempt and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the Lord
      will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites,
      may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed by fire. '
    7: "⁷ Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because\
      \ the Lord’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Lord said to Aaron, '
    9: '⁹ “You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever
      you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance
      for the generations to come, '
    10: '¹⁰ so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the
      unclean and the clean, '
    11: "¹¹ and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the Lord has given\
      \ them through Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take
      the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast
      and presented to the Lord and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy. '
    13: '¹³ Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’
      share of the food offerings presented to the Lord; for so I have been commanded. '
    14: '¹⁴ But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved
      and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they
      have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship
      offerings. '
    15: "¹⁵ The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought\
      \ with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the Lord as\
      \ a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children,\
      \ as the Lord has commanded.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that
      it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining
      sons, and asked, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most
      holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making
      atonement for them before the Lord. '
    18: "¹⁸ Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten\
      \ the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and
      their burnt offering before the Lord, but such things as this have happened
      to me. Would the Lord have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?” '
    20: ²⁰ When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
  11:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: '² “Say to the Israelites: ‘Of all the animals that live on land, these are
      the ones you may eat: '
    3: "³ You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘There are some that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, but
      you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided
      hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you. '
    5: '⁵ The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is
      unclean for you. '
    6: '⁶ The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is
      unclean for you. '
    7: '⁷ And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is
      unclean for you. '
    8: "⁸ You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for\
      \ you. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you
      may eat any that have fins and scales. '
    10: '¹⁰ But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether
      among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the
      water—you are to regard as unclean. '
    11: '¹¹ And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat;
      you must regard their carcasses as unclean. '
    12: "¹² Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to\
      \ be regarded as unclean by you. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘These are the birds you are to regard as unclean and not eat because
      they are unclean: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, '
    14: '¹⁴ the red kite, any kind of black kite, '
    15: '¹⁵ any kind of raven, '
    16: '¹⁶ the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, '
    17: '¹⁷ the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, '
    18: '¹⁸ the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, '
    19: "¹⁹ the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as unclean
      by you. '
    21: '²¹ There are, however, some flying insects that walk on all fours that you
      may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground. '
    22: '²² Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper. '
    23: "²³ But all other flying insects that have four legs you are to regard as\
      \ unclean. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “‘You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses
      will be unclean till evening. '
    25: "²⁵ Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they\
      \ will be unclean till evening. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘Every animal that does not have a divided hoof or that does not chew
      the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will
      be unclean. '
    27: '²⁷ Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws
      are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening. '
    28: "²⁸ Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they\
      \ will be unclean till evening. These animals are unclean for you. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘Of the animals that move along the ground, these are unclean for you:
      the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, '
    30: '³⁰ the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon. '
    31: '³¹ Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever
      touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening. '
    32: '³² When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its
      use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth.
      Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean. '
    33: '³³ If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean,
      and you must break the pot. '
    34: '³⁴ Any food you are allowed to eat that has come into contact with water
      from any such pot is unclean, and any liquid that is drunk from such a pot is
      unclean. '
    35: '³⁵ Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven
      or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them
      as unclean. '
    36: '³⁶ A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but
      anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean. '
    37: '³⁷ If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean. '
    38: "³⁸ But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is\
      \ unclean for you. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “‘If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its
      carcass will be unclean till evening. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash their clothes, and they\
      \ will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash their\
      \ clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “‘Every creature that moves along the ground is to be regarded as unclean;
      it is not to be eaten. '
    42: '⁴² You are not to eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it
      moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is unclean. '
    43: '⁴³ Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves
      unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them. '
    44: '⁴⁴ I am the Lord your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am
      holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground. '
    45: "⁴⁵ I am the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore\
      \ be holy, because I am holy. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “‘These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing

    47: ⁴⁷ You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living
      creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.’”
  12:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to
      a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during
      her monthly period. '
    3: '³ On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised. '
    4: '⁴ Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding.
      She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of
      her purification are over. '
    5: "⁵ If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean,\
      \ as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from\
      \ her bleeding. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she
      is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year-old
      lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering. '
    7: "⁷ He shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and then\
      \ she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood.\n“‘These are the regulations\
      \ for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl. "
    8: ⁸ But if she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons,
      one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest
      will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”
  13:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, '
    2: '² “When anyone has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot on their skin that
      may be a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or
      to one of his sons who is a priest. '
    3: '³ The priest is to examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore
      has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling
      skin disease. When the priest examines that person, he shall pronounce them
      ceremonially unclean. '
    4: '⁴ If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than

    15: "¹⁵ so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the Lord,\
      \ who makes him holy.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to come none of your descendants who
      has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God. '
    18: '¹⁸ No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame,
      disfigured or deformed; '
    19: '¹⁹ no man with a crippled foot or hand, '
    20: '²⁰ or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has
      festering or running sores or damaged testicles. '
    21: '²¹ No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to
      present the food offerings to the Lord. He has a defect; he must not come near
      to offer the food of his God. '
    22: '²² He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food; '
    23: "²³ yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach\
      \ the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.’”\
      \ \n"
    24: ²⁴ So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
  22:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the\
      \ Israelites consecrate to me, so they will not profane my holy name. I am the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    3: "³ “Say to them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants is\
      \ ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the Israelites\
      \ consecrate to the Lord, that person must be cut off from my presence. I am\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘If a descendant of Aaron has a defiling skin disease or a bodily discharge,
      he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean
      if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission
      of semen, '
    5: '⁵ or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean, or any person
      who makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be. '
    6: '⁶ The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must
      not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water. '
    7: '⁷ When the sun goes down, he will be clean, and after that he may eat the
      sacred offerings, for they are his food. '
    8: "⁸ He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, and so become\
      \ unclean through it. I am the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “‘The priests are to perform my service in such a way that they do not become\
      \ guilty and die for treating it with contempt. I am the Lord, who makes them\
      \ holy. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may
      the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it. '
    11: '¹¹ But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if slaves are born in his
      household, they may eat his food. '
    12: '¹² If a priest’s daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not
      eat any of the sacred contributions. '
    13: "¹³ But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no\
      \ children, and she returns to live in her father’s household as in her youth,\
      \ she may eat her father’s food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘Anyone who eats a sacred offering by mistake must make restitution to
      the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present
      to the Lord '
    16: "¹⁶ by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt\
      \ requiring payment. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord said to Moses, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them:
      ‘If any of you—whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel—presents
      a gift for a burnt offering to the Lord, either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill
      offering, '
    19: '¹⁹ you must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats
      in order that it may be accepted on your behalf. '
    20: '²⁰ Do not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on
      your behalf. '
    21: '²¹ When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the
      Lord to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without
      defect or blemish to be acceptable. '
    22: '²² Do not offer to the Lord the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything
      with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar
      as a food offering presented to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ You may, however, present as a freewill offering an ox or a sheep that
      is deformed or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow. '
    24: '²⁴ You must not offer to the Lord an animal whose testicles are bruised,
      crushed, torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land, '
    25: "²⁵ and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and\
      \ offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf,\
      \ because they are deformed and have defects.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ The Lord said to Moses, '
    27: '²⁷ “When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born, it is to remain with its mother
      for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering
      presented to the Lord. '
    28: "²⁸ Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When you sacrifice a thank offering to the Lord, sacrifice it in such
      a way that it will be accepted on your behalf. '
    30: "³⁰ It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it till morning. I am the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Keep my commands and follow them. I am the Lord. '
    32: '³² Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the
      Israelites. I am the Lord, who made you holy '
    33: ³³ and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.”
  23:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: "² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are my appointed festivals,\
      \ the appointed festivals of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “‘There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a day of\
      \ sabbath rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever\
      \ you live, it is a sabbath to the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are
      to proclaim at their appointed times: '
    5: '⁵ The Lord’s Passover begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first
      month. '
    6: '⁶ On the fifteenth day of that month the Lord’s Festival of Unleavened Bread
      begins; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. '
    7: '⁷ On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. '
    8: "⁸ For seven days present a food offering to the Lord. And on the seventh day\
      \ hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord said to Moses, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am
      going to give you and you reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the
      first grain you harvest. '
    11: '¹¹ He is to wave the sheaf before the Lord so it will be accepted on your
      behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath. '
    12: '¹² On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering
      to the Lord a lamb a year old without defect, '
    13: '¹³ together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest
      flour mixed with olive oil—a food offering presented to the Lord, a pleasing
      aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine. '
    14: "¹⁴ You must not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day\
      \ you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for\
      \ the generations to come, wherever you live. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the
      wave offering, count off seven full weeks. '
    16: '¹⁶ Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then
      present an offering of new grain to the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah
      of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to
      the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ Present with this bread seven male lambs, each a year old and without
      defect, one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the Lord,
      together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, an
      aroma pleasing to the Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs, each a
      year old, for a fellowship offering. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest is to wave the two lambs before the Lord as a wave offering,
      together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the
      Lord for the priest. '
    21: "²¹ On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular\
      \ work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever\
      \ you live. \n"
    22: "²² “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges\
      \ of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the\
      \ poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the Lord your God.’” \n"
    23: '²³ The Lord said to Moses, '
    24: '²⁴ “Say to the Israelites: ‘On the first day of the seventh month you are
      to have a day of sabbath rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts. '
    25: "²⁵ Do no regular work, but present a food offering to the Lord.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ The Lord said to Moses, '
    27: '²⁷ “The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred
      assembly and deny yourselves, and present a food offering to the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when
      atonement is made for you before the Lord your God. '
    29: '²⁹ Those who do not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their
      people. '
    30: '³⁰ I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that
      day. '
    31: '³¹ You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the
      generations to come, wherever you live. '
    32: "³² It is a day of sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From\
      \ the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you\
      \ are to observe your sabbath.” \n"
    33: '³³ The Lord said to Moses, '
    34: '³⁴ “Say to the Israelites: ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the
      Lord’s Festival of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts for seven days. '
    35: '³⁵ The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work. '
    36: "³⁶ For seven days present food offerings to the Lord, and on the eighth day\
      \ hold a sacred assembly and present a food offering to the Lord. It is the\
      \ closing special assembly; do no regular work. \n"
    37: '³⁷ (“‘These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim
      as sacred assemblies for bringing food offerings to the Lord—the burnt offerings
      and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day. '
    38: "³⁸ These offerings are in addition to those for the Lord’s Sabbaths and in\
      \ addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings\
      \ you give to the Lord.) \n"
    39: '³⁹ “‘So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you
      have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the Lord for
      seven days; the first day is a day of sabbath rest, and the eighth day also
      is a day of sabbath rest. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees—from palms,
      willows and other leafy trees—and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven
      days. '
    41: '⁴¹ Celebrate this as a festival to the Lord for seven days each year. This
      is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the
      seventh month. '
    42: '⁴² Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites
      are to live in such shelters '
    43: "⁴³ so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary\
      \ shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’” \n"
    44: ⁴⁴ So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the Lord.
  24:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the
      light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually. '
    3: '³ Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent
      of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning,
      continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. '
    4: "⁴ The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths
      of an ephah for each loaf. '
    6: '⁶ Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold
      before the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ By each stack put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the
      bread and to be a food offering presented to the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ This bread is to be set out before the Lord regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath,
      on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant. '
    9: "⁹ It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in the sanctuary area,\
      \ because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the food offerings\
      \ presented to the Lord.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among
      the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite. '
    11: '¹¹ The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they
      brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri
      the Danite.) '
    12: "¹² They put him in custody until the will of the Lord should be made clear\
      \ to them. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Lord said to Moses: '
    14: '¹⁴ “Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to
      lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible; '
    16: "¹⁶ anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be put to death. The\
      \ entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they\
      \ blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “‘Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ Anyone who takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life
      for life. '
    19: '¹⁹ Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner: '
    20: '²⁰ fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted
      the injury must suffer the same injury. '
    21: '²¹ Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human
      being is to be put to death. '
    22: "²² You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I\
      \ am the Lord your God.’” \n"
    23: ²³ Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside
      the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai, '
    2: '² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am
      going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord. '
    3: '³ For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and
      gather their crops. '
    4: '⁴ But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath
      to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. '
    5: '⁵ Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended
      vines. The land is to have a year of rest. '
    6: '⁶ Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for
      yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary
      resident who live among you, '
    7: "⁷ as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever\
      \ the land produces may be eaten. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven
      sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. '
    9: '⁹ Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh
      month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. '
    10: '¹⁰ Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land
      to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return
      to your family property and to your own clan. '
    11: '¹¹ The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap
      what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. '
    12: "¹² For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken\
      \ directly from the fields. \n"
    13: "¹³ “‘In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do
      not take advantage of each other. '
    15: '¹⁵ You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years
      since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of
      years left for harvesting crops. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years
      are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to
      you is the number of crops. '
    17: "¹⁷ Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the Lord\
      \ your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live
      safely in the land. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live
      there in safety. '
    20: '²⁰ You may ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant
      or harvest our crops?” '
    21: '²¹ I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield
      enough for three years. '
    22: "²² While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop\
      \ and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes\
      \ in. \n"
    23: '²³ “‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and
      you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers. '
    24: "²⁴ Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for\
      \ the redemption of the land. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their
      property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold. '
    26: '²⁶ If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper
      and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, '
    27: '²⁷ they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund
      the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their
      own property. '
    28: "²⁸ But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain\
      \ in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned\
      \ in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption
      a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it. '
    30: '³⁰ If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the
      walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer’s descendants.
      It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. '
    31: "³¹ But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered\
      \ as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be\
      \ returned in the Jubilee. \n"
    32: '³² “‘The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical
      towns, which they possess. '
    33: '³³ So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in
      any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses
      in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. '
    34: "³⁴ But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their\
      \ permanent possession. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support
      themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they
      can continue to live among you. '
    36: '³⁶ Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that
      they may continue to live among you. '
    37: '³⁷ You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit. '
    38: "³⁸ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land\
      \ of Canaan and to be your God. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to
      you, do not make them work as slaves. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you;
      they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. '
    41: '⁴¹ Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back
      to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. '
    42: '⁴² Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they
      must not be sold as slaves. '
    43: "⁴³ Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you;
      from them you may buy slaves. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and

    46: "⁴⁶ You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make\

      of their relatives may redeem them: '
    49: '⁴⁹ An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them.
      Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. '
    50: '⁵⁰ They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves
      up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the
      rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. '
    51: '⁵¹ If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share
      of the price paid for them. '
    52: '⁵² If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute
      that and pay for their redemption accordingly. '
    53: "⁵³ They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see\
      \ to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.\
      \ \n"
    54: '⁵⁴ “‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their
      children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee, '
    55: ⁵⁵ for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom
      I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
  26:
    1: "“‘Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and\
      \ do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord\
      \ your God. \n"
    2: "² “‘Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ “‘If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, '
    4: '⁴ I will send you rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops
      and the trees their fruit. '
    5: "⁵ Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will\
      \ continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in\
      \ safety in your land. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will
      make you afraid. I will remove wild beasts from the land, and the sword will
      not pass through your country. '
    7: '⁷ You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. '
    8: "⁸ Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand,\
      \ and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your
      numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You will still be eating last year’s harvest when you will have to move
      it out to make room for the new. '
    11: '¹¹ I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you. '
    12: '¹² I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. '
    13: "¹³ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would\
      \ no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled\
      \ you to walk with heads held high. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands, '
    15: '¹⁵ and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all
      my commands and so violate my covenant, '
    16: '¹⁶ then I will do this to you: I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting
      diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will
      plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies;\
      \ those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one\
      \ is pursuing you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “‘If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your
      sins seven times over. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like
      iron and the ground beneath you like bronze. '
    20: "²⁰ Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield\
      \ its crops, nor will the trees of your land yield their fruit. \n"
    21: '²¹ “‘If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply
      your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve. '
    22: "²² I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children,\
      \ destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be\
      \ deserted. \n"
    23: '²³ “‘If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue
      to be hostile toward me, '
    24: '²⁴ I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins
      seven times over. '
    25: '²⁵ And I will bring the sword on you to avenge the breaking of the covenant.
      When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you
      will be given into enemy hands. '
    26: "²⁶ When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your\
      \ bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat,\
      \ but you will not be satisfied. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “‘If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be
      hostile toward me, '
    28: '²⁸ then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish
      you for your sins seven times over. '
    29: '²⁹ You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters. '
    30: '³⁰ I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile
      your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you. '
    31: '³¹ I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and
      I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings. '
    32: '³² I myself will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there
      will be appalled. '
    33: '³³ I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue
      you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins. '
    34: '³⁴ Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate
      and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy
      its sabbaths. '
    35: "³⁵ All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did\
      \ not have during the sabbaths you lived in it. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “‘As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful
      in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them
      to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall,
      even though no one is pursuing them. '
    37: '³⁷ They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even
      though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your
      enemies. '
    38: '³⁸ You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour
      you. '
    39: "³⁹ Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies\
      \ because of their sins; also because of their ancestors’ sins they will waste\
      \ away. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “‘But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their
      unfaithfulness and their hostility toward me, '
    41: '⁴¹ which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of
      their enemies—then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay
      for their sin, '
    42: '⁴² I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and
      my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. '
    43: '⁴³ For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while
      it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected
      my laws and abhorred my decrees. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will
      not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my
      covenant with them. I am the Lord their God. '
    45: "⁴⁵ But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom\
      \ I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the\
      \ Lord.’” \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the Lord established
      at Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
  27:
    1: 'The Lord said to Moses, '
    2: '² “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow
      to dedicate a person to the Lord by giving the equivalent value, '
    3: '³ set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels
      of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel; '
    4: '⁴ for a female, set her value at thirty shekels; '
    5: '⁵ for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male
      at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels; '
    6: '⁶ for a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at
      five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver; '
    7: '⁷ for a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen
      shekels and of a female at ten shekels. '
    8: "⁸ If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, the person\
      \ being dedicated is to be presented to the priest, who will set the value according\
      \ to what the one making the vow can afford. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘If what they vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the
      Lord, such an animal given to the Lord becomes holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ They must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a
      bad one for a good one; if they should substitute one animal for another, both
      it and the substitute become holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable
      as an offering to the Lord—the animal must be presented to the priest, '
    12: '¹² who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then
      sets, that is what it will be. '
    13: "¹³ If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, a fifth must be added to its\
      \ value. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If anyone dedicates their house as something holy to the Lord, the priest
      will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets,
      so it will remain. '
    15: "¹⁵ If the one who dedicates their house wishes to redeem it, they must add\
      \ a fifth to its value, and the house will again become theirs. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord part of their family land, its value
      is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of
      silver to a homer of barley seed. '
    17: '¹⁷ If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has
      been set remains. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine
      the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of
      Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced. '
    19: '¹⁹ If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add
      a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs. '
    20: '²⁰ If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to
      someone else, it can never be redeemed. '
    21: "²¹ When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a\
      \ field devoted to the Lord; it will become priestly property. \n"
    22: '²² “‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord a field they have bought, which is not
      part of their family land, '
    23: '²³ the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the
      owner must pay its value on that day as something holy to the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it
      was bought, the one whose land it was. '
    25: "²⁵ Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs\
      \ to the shekel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the
      firstborn already belongs to the Lord; whether an ox or a sheep, it is the Lord’s. '
    27: "²⁷ If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set\
      \ value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to\
      \ be sold at its set value. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “‘But nothing that a person owns and devotes to the Lord—whether a human\
      \ being or an animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted\
      \ is most holy to the Lord. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “‘No person devoted to destruction may be ransomed; they are to be put\
      \ to death. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or
      fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord; it is holy to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value
      to it. '
    32: '³² Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under
      the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the Lord. '
    33: "³³ No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If\
      \ anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become\
      \ holy and cannot be redeemed.’” \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commands the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
