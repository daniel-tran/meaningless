Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received. \n"
    2: "² How long, Lord, must I call for help,\n    but you do not listen?\nOr cry\
      \ out to you, “Violence!”\n    but you do not save?\n"
    3: "³ Why do you make me look at injustice?\n    Why do you tolerate wrongdoing?\n\
      Destruction and violence are before me;\n    there is strife, and conflict abounds.\n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore the law is paralyzed,\n    and justice never prevails.\nThe wicked\
      \ hem in the righteous,\n    so that justice is perverted. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Look at the nations and watch—\n    and be utterly amazed.\nFor I am going\
      \ to do something in your days\n    that you would not believe,\n    even if\
      \ you were told.\n"
    6: "⁶ I am raising up the Babylonians,\n    that ruthless and impetuous people,\n\
      who sweep across the whole earth\n    to seize dwellings not their own.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are a feared and dreaded people;\n    they are a law to themselves\n\
      \    and promote their own honor.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    fiercer than wolves at dusk.\n\
      Their cavalry gallops headlong;\n    their horsemen come from afar.\nThey fly\
      \ like an eagle swooping to devour;\n"
    9: "⁹     they all come intent on violence.\nTheir hordes advance like a desert\
      \ wind\n    and gather prisoners like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They mock kings\n    and scoff at rulers.\nThey laugh at all fortified\
      \ cities;\n    by building earthen ramps they capture them.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—\n    guilty people, whose\
      \ own strength is their god.” \n"
    12: "¹² Lord, are you not from everlasting?\n    My God, my Holy One, you will\
      \ never die.\nYou, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment;\n    you,\
      \ my Rock, have ordained them to punish.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your eyes are too pure to look on evil;\n    you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.\n\
      Why then do you tolerate the treacherous?\n    Why are you silent while the\
      \ wicked\n    swallow up those more righteous than themselves?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You have made people like the fish in the sea,\n    like the sea creatures\
      \ that have no ruler.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks,\n    he catches them in\
      \ his net,\nhe gathers them up in his dragnet;\n    and so he rejoices and is\
      \ glad.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore he sacrifices to his net\n    and burns incense to his dragnet,\n\
      for by his net he lives in luxury\n    and enjoys the choicest food.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Is he to keep on emptying his net,\n    destroying nations without mercy?"
  2:
    1: "I will stand at my watch\n    and station myself on the ramparts;\nI will\
      \ look to see what he will say to me,\n    and what answer I am to give to this\
      \ complaint. \n"
    2: "² Then the Lord replied:\n“Write down the revelation\n    and make it plain\
      \ on tablets\n    so that a herald may run with it.\n"
    3: "³ For the revelation awaits an appointed time;\n    it speaks of the end\n\
      \    and will not prove false.\nThough it linger, wait for it;\n    it will\
      \ certainly come\n    and will not delay. \n"
    4: "⁴ “See, the enemy is puffed up;\n    his desires are not upright—\n    but\
      \ the righteous person will live by his faithfulness—\n"
    5: "⁵ indeed, wine betrays him;\n    he is arrogant and never at rest.\nBecause\
      \ he is as greedy as the grave\n    and like death is never satisfied,\nhe gathers\
      \ to himself all the nations\n    and takes captive all the peoples. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying,\n“‘Woe\
      \ to him who piles up stolen goods\n    and makes himself wealthy by extortion!\n\
      \    How long must this go on?’\n"
    7: "⁷ Will not your creditors suddenly arise?\n    Will they not wake up and make\
      \ you tremble?\n    Then you will become their prey.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because you have plundered many nations,\n    the peoples who are left will\
      \ plunder you.\nFor you have shed human blood;\n    you have destroyed lands\
      \ and cities and everyone in them. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,\n    setting his nest on\
      \ high\n    to escape the clutches of ruin!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You have plotted the ruin of many peoples,\n    shaming your own house\
      \ and forfeiting your life.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The stones of the wall will cry out,\n    and the beams of the woodwork\
      \ will echo it. \n"
    12: "¹² “Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed\n    and establishes a town\
      \ by injustice!\n"
    13: "¹³ Has not the Lord Almighty determined\n    that the people’s labor is only\
      \ fuel for the fire,\n    that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord\n\
      \    as the waters cover the sea. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors,\n    pouring it from the\
      \ wineskin till they are drunk,\n    so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You will be filled with shame instead of glory.\n    Now it is your turn!\
      \ Drink and let your nakedness be exposed!\nThe cup from the Lord’s right hand\
      \ is coming around to you,\n    and disgrace will cover your glory.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,\n    and your\
      \ destruction of animals will terrify you.\nFor you have shed human blood;\n\
      \    you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman?\n    Or an image that\
      \ teaches lies?\nFor the one who makes it trusts in his own creation;\n    he\
      \ makes idols that cannot speak.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’\n    Or to lifeless stone,\
      \ ‘Wake up!’\nCan it give guidance?\n    It is covered with gold and silver;\n\
      \    there is no breath in it.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ The Lord is in his holy temple;\n    let all the earth be silent before\
      \ him."
  3:
    1: "A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth. \n"
    2: "² Lord, I have heard of your fame;\n    I stand in awe of your deeds, Lord.\n\
      Repeat them in our day,\n    in our time make them known;\n    in wrath remember\
      \ mercy. \n"
    3: "³ God came from Teman,\n    the Holy One from Mount Paran.\nHis glory covered\
      \ the heavens\n    and his praise filled the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ His splendor was like the sunrise;\n    rays flashed from his hand,\n  \
      \  where his power was hidden.\n"
    5: "⁵ Plague went before him;\n    pestilence followed his steps.\n"
    6: "⁶ He stood, and shook the earth;\n    he looked, and made the nations tremble.\n\
      The ancient mountains crumbled\n    and the age-old hills collapsed—\n    but\
      \ he marches on forever.\n"
    7: "⁷ I saw the tents of Cushan in distress,\n    the dwellings of Midian in anguish.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Were you angry with the rivers, Lord?\n    Was your wrath against the streams?\n\
      Did you rage against the sea\n    when you rode your horses\n    and your chariots\
      \ to victory?\n"
    9: "⁹ You uncovered your bow,\n    you called for many arrows.\nYou split the\
      \ earth with rivers;\n"
    10: "¹⁰     the mountains saw you and writhed.\nTorrents of water swept by;\n\
      \    the deep roared\n    and lifted its waves on high. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Sun and moon stood still in the heavens\n    at the glint of your flying\
      \ arrows,\n    at the lightning of your flashing spear.\n"
    12: "¹² In wrath you strode through the earth\n    and in anger you threshed the\
      \ nations.\n"
    13: "¹³ You came out to deliver your people,\n    to save your anointed one.\n\
      You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness,\n    you stripped him from\
      \ head to foot.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With his own spear you pierced his head\n    when his warriors stormed\
      \ out to scatter us,\ngloating as though about to devour\n    the wretched who\
      \ were in hiding.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    churning the great waters.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I heard and my heart pounded,\n    my lips quivered at the sound;\ndecay\
      \ crept into my bones,\n    and my legs trembled.\nYet I will wait patiently\
      \ for the day of calamity\n    to come on the nation invading us.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Though the fig tree does not bud\n    and there are no grapes on the vines,\n\
      though the olive crop fails\n    and the fields produce no food,\nthough there\
      \ are no sheep in the pen\n    and no cattle in the stalls,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\n    I will be joyful in God my Savior.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Sovereign Lord is my strength;\n    he makes my feet like the feet\
      \ of a deer,\n    he enables me to tread on the heights.\nFor the director of\
      \ music. On my stringed instruments."
