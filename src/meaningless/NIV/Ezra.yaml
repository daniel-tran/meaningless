Ezra:
  1:
    1: "In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of\
      \ the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia\
      \ to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² “This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:\n“‘The Lord, the God of heaven,\
      \ has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build\
      \ a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. "
    3: '³ Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the
      temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem, and may
      their God be with them. '
    4: "⁴ And in any locality where survivors may now be living, the people are to\
      \ provide them with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill\
      \ offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites—everyone
      whose heart God had moved—prepared to go up and build the house of the Lord
      in Jerusalem. '
    6: "⁶ All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with\
      \ goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill\
      \ offerings. \n"
    7: '⁷ Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of
      the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed
      in the temple of his god. '
    8: "⁸ Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted\
      \ them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. \n"
    9: '⁹ This was the inventory:gold dishes 30silver dishes 1,000silver pans 29 '
    10: "¹⁰ gold bowls 30matching silver bowls 410other articles 1,000 \n"
    11: ¹¹ In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought
      all these along with the exiles when they came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
  2:
    1: 'Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of
      the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon
      (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own town, '

      the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
  3:
    1: 'When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,
      the people assembled together as one in Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Then Joshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of
      Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to
      sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law
      of Moses the man of God. '
    3: '³ Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its
      foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the Lord, both the morning
      and evening sacrifices. '
    4: '⁴ Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Festival of
      Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each

    5: '⁵ After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices
      and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred festivals of the Lord, as well
      as those brought as freewill offerings to the Lord. '
    6: "⁶ On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings\
      \ to the Lord, though the foundation of the Lord’s temple had not yet been laid.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink\
      \ and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar\
      \ logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house
      of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak and
      the rest of the people (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned
      from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work. They appointed Levites twenty
      years old and older to supervise the building of the house of the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ Joshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of\
      \ Hodaviah) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers—all Levites—joined\
      \ together in supervising those working on the house of God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests
      in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with
      cymbals, took their places to praise the Lord, as prescribed by David king of
      Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord:\n“He is good;\n  \
      \  his love toward Israel endures forever.”\nAnd all the people gave a great\
      \ shout of praise to the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord\
      \ was laid. "
    12: '¹² But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen
      the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being
      laid, while many others shouted for joy. '
    13: ¹³ No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound
      of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far
      away.
  4:
    1: 'When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building
      a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel, '
    2: "² they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, “Let\
      \ us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing\
      \ to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ But Zerubbabel, Joshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel\
      \ answered, “You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone\
      \ will build it for the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of\
      \ Persia, commanded us.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and
      make them afraid to go on building. '
    5: "⁵ They bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans during\
      \ the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king\
      \ of Persia. \n"
    6: "⁶ At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against\
      \ the people of Judah and Jerusalem. \n"
    7: "⁷ And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel\
      \ and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was\
      \ written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language. \n"
    8: "⁸ Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against\
      \ Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows: \n"
    9: '⁹ Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the
      rest of their associates—the judges, officials and administrators over the people
      from Persia, Uruk and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa, '
    10: "¹⁰ and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported\
      \ and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates. \n"
    11: "¹¹ (This is a copy of the letter they sent him.)\nTo King Artaxerxes,\nFrom\
      \ your servants in Trans-Euphrates: \n"
    12: "¹² The king should know that the people who came up to us from you have gone\
      \ to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are\
      \ restoring the walls and repairing the foundations. \n"
    13: '¹³ Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls
      are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and eventually the
      royal revenues will suffer. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for
      us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king, '
    15: '¹⁵ so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In
      these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome
      to kings and provinces, a place with a long history of sedition. That is why
      this city was destroyed. '
    16: "¹⁶ We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored,\
      \ you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The king sent this reply:\nTo Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the\
      \ secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere\
      \ in Trans-Euphrates:\nGreetings. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence. '
    19: '¹⁹ I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city
      has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion
      and sedition. '
    20: '²⁰ Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates,
      and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them. '
    21: '²¹ Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not
      be rebuilt until I so order. '
    22: "²² Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the\
      \ detriment of the royal interests? \n"
    23: "²³ As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum\
      \ and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to\
      \ the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until
      the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
  5:
    1: 'Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied
      to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was
      over them. '
    2: "² Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jozadak set to work to\
      \ rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them,\
      \ supporting them. \n"
    3: '³ At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai
      and their associates went to them and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild
      this temple and to finish it?” '
    4: '⁴ They also asked, “What are the names of those who are constructing this
      building?” '
    5: "⁵ But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they\
      \ were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be\
      \ received. \n"
    6: '⁶ This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates,
      and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates,
      sent to King Darius. '
    7: "⁷ The report they sent him read as follows:\nTo King Darius:\nCordial greetings.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple\
      \ of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing\
      \ the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and\
      \ is making rapid progress under their direction. \n"
    9: '⁹ We questioned the elders and asked them, “Who authorized you to rebuild
      this temple and to finish it?” '
    10: "¹⁰ We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names\
      \ of their leaders for your information. \n"
    11: "¹¹ This is the answer they gave us:\n“We are the servants of the God of heaven\
      \ and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago,\
      \ one that a great king of Israel built and finished. "
    12: "¹² But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into\
      \ the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this\
      \ temple and deported the people to Babylon. \n"
    13: '¹³ “However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued
      a decree to rebuild this house of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles
      of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem
      and brought to the temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named
      Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor, '
    15: "¹⁵ and he told him, ‘Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple\
      \ in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.’ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God\
      \ in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction\
      \ but is not yet finished.” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives
      of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house
      of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
  6:
    1: 'King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored
      in the treasury at Babylon. '
    2: "² A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media,\
      \ and this was written on it:\nMemorandum: \n"
    3: "³ In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the\
      \ temple of God in Jerusalem:\nLet the temple be rebuilt as a place to present\
      \ sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be sixty cubits high\
      \ and sixty cubits wide, "
    4: '⁴ with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to
      be paid by the royal treasury. '
    5: "⁵ Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned\
      \ to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the\
      \ house of God. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and
      you other officials of that province, stay away from there. '
    7: "⁷ Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of\
      \ the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site. \n"
    8: "⁸ Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews\
      \ in the construction of this house of God:\nTheir expenses are to be fully\
      \ paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that\
      \ the work will not stop. "
    9: '⁹ Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to
      the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and olive oil, as requested by the
      priests in Jerusalem—must be given them daily without fail, '
    10: "¹⁰ so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray\
      \ for the well-being of the king and his sons. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Furthermore, I decree that if anyone defies this edict, a beam is to be
      pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it. And for this crime
      their house is to be made a pile of rubble. '
    12: "¹² May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or\
      \ people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in\
      \ Jerusalem.\nI Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of
      Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with
      diligence. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching
      of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building
      the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of
      Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. '
    15: "¹⁵ The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth\
      \ year of the reign of King Darius. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the
      exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls,
      two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel,
      twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel. '
    18: "¹⁸ And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their\
      \ groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in\
      \ the Book of Moses. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover. '
    20: '²⁰ The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially
      clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their
      relatives the priests and for themselves. '
    21: '²¹ So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with
      all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile
      neighbors in order to seek the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    22: ²² For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread,
      because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king
      of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God
      of Israel.
  7:
    1: 'After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son
      of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, '

    7: "⁷ Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers\

    10: "¹⁰ For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of\
      \ the Lord, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel. \n"
    11: "¹¹ This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest,\
      \ a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and\
      \ decrees of the Lord for Israel: \n"
    12: "¹² Artaxerxes, king of kings,\nTo Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of\
      \ the God of heaven:\nGreetings. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests
      and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go. '
    14: '¹⁴ You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah
      and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and
      his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, '
    16: '¹⁶ together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province
      of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for
      the temple of their God in Jerusalem. '
    17: "¹⁷ With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with\
      \ their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar\
      \ of the temple of your God in Jerusalem. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the
      rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God. '
    19: '¹⁹ Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for
      worship in the temple of your God. '
    20: "²⁰ And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible\
      \ to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury. \n"
    21: '²¹ Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates
      are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law
      of the God of heaven, may ask of you— '
    22: '²² up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred
      baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit. '
    23: '²³ Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence
      for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm
      of the king and of his sons? '
    24: "²⁴ You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute\
      \ or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants\
      \ or other workers at this house of God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess,
      appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all
      who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them. '
    26: "²⁶ Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must\
      \ surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Praise be to the Lord, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the
      king’s heart to bring honor to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in this way '
    28: ²⁸ and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers
      and all the king’s powerful officials. Because the hand of the Lord my God was
      on me, I took courage and gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me.
  8:
    1: "These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with\
      \ me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes: \n"

      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there
      three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites
      there. '
    16: '¹⁶ So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan,
      Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were
      men of learning, '
    17: '¹⁷ and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them
      what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia,
      so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah,
      a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel,
      and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all; '
    19: '¹⁹ and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari,
      and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. '
    20: "²⁰ They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the\
      \ officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble
      ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children,
      with all our possessions. '
    22: '²² I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us
      from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of
      our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all
      who forsake him.” '
    23: "²³ So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah
      and ten of their brothers, '
    25: '²⁵ and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles
      that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had
      donated for the house of our God. '
    26: '²⁶ I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing
      100 talents, 100 talents of gold, '
    27: "²⁷ 20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished\
      \ bronze, as precious as gold. \n"
    28: '²⁸ I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the
      Lord. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your
      ancestors. '
    29: '²⁹ Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house
      of the Lord in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the
      family heads of Israel.” '
    30: "³⁰ Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles\
      \ that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal
      to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from
      enemies and bandits along the way. '
    32: "³² So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days. \n"
    33: '³³ On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver
      and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the
      priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad
      son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. '
    34: "³⁴ Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight\
      \ was recorded at that time. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings
      to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven
      male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering
      to the Lord. '
    36: ³⁶ They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors
      of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house
      of God.
  9:
    1: 'After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people
      of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate
      from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of
      the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians
      and Amorites. '
    2: "² They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their\
      \ sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the\
      \ leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.” \n"
    3: '³ When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and
      beard and sat down appalled. '
    4: "⁴ Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around\
      \ me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled\
      \ until the evening sacrifice. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic
      and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my
      God '
    6: "⁶ and prayed:\n“I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face\
      \ to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached\
      \ to the heavens. "
    7: "⁷ From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because\
      \ of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword\
      \ and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as\
      \ it is today. \n"
    8: '⁸ “But now, for a brief moment, the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving
      us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives
      light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage. '
    9: "⁹ Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has\
      \ shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new\
      \ life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given\
      \ us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the
      commands '
    11: '¹¹ you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you
      are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples.
      By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one
      end to the other. '
    12: "¹² Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take\
      \ their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them\
      \ at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and\
      \ leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt,
      and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have
      given us a remnant like this. '
    14: '¹⁴ Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples
      who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us
      to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? '
    15: ¹⁵ Lord, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant.
      Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can
      stand in your presence.”
  10:
    1: 'While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before
      the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered
      around him. They too wept bitterly. '
    2: '² Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra,
      “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples
      around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. '
    3: '³ Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and
      their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear
      the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. '
    4: "⁴ Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage\
      \ and do it.” \n"
    5: '⁵ So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under
      oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. '
    6: "⁶ Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of\
      \ Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no\
      \ water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the
      exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property,\
      \ in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself\
      \ be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. \n"
    9: '⁹ Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in
      Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were
      sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion
      and because of the rain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful;
      you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. '
    11: "¹¹ Now honor the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate\
      \ yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.” \n"
    12: '¹² The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must
      do as you say. '
    13: '¹³ But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot
      stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two,
      because we have sinned greatly in this thing. '
    14: '¹⁴ Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our
      towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders
      and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is
      turned away from us.” '
    15: "¹⁵ Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam\
      \ and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were
      family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name.
      On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, '
    17: "¹⁷ and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all\

    18: "¹⁸ Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign\

    19: "¹⁹ (They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for\
