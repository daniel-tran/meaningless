Titus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith
      of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness— '
    2: '² in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before
      the beginning of time, '
    3: "³ and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the\
      \ preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, \n"
    4: "⁴ To Titus, my true son in our common faith:\nGrace and peace from God the\
      \ Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. \n"
    5: '⁵ The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was
      left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you. '
    6: '⁶ An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe
      and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. '
    7: '⁷ Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing,
      not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest
      gain. '
    8: '⁸ Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled,
      upright, holy and disciplined. '
    9: "⁹ He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so\
      \ that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose\
      \ it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception,
      especially those of the circumcision group. '
    11: '¹¹ They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by
      teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. '
    12: '¹² One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil
      brutes, lazy gluttons.” '
    13: '¹³ This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will
      be sound in the faith '
    14: '¹⁴ and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands
      of those who reject the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do
      not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are
      corrupted. '
    16: ¹⁶ They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable,
      disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
  2:
    1: '¹ You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine. '
    2: "² Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled,\
      \ and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. \n"
    3: '³ Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not
      to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. '
    4: '⁴ Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, '
    5: "⁵ to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be\
      \ subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. \n"
    6: '⁶ Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. '
    7: '⁷ In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching
      show integrity, seriousness '
    8: "⁸ and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose\
      \ you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. \n"
    9: '⁹ Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please
      them, not to talk back to them, '
    10: "¹⁰ and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted,\
      \ so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. '
    12: '¹² It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to
      live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, '
    13: '¹³ while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great
      God and Savior, Jesus Christ, '
    14: "¹⁴ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify\
      \ for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with
      all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
  3:
    1: '¹ Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient,
      to be ready to do whatever is good, '
    2: "² to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle\
      \ toward everyone. \n"
    3: '³ At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all
      kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and
      hating one another. '
    4: '⁴ But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, '
    5: '⁵ he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of
      his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy
      Spirit, '
    6: '⁶ whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, '
    7: '⁷ so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having
      the hope of eternal life. '
    8: "⁸ This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so\
      \ that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to\
      \ doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels
      about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. '
    10: '¹⁰ Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that,
      have nothing to do with them. '
    11: "¹¹ You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to
      me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. '
    13: '¹³ Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way
      and see that they have everything they need. '
    14: "¹⁴ Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order\
      \ to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith.\n\
      Grace be with you all."
