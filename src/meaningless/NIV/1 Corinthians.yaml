1 Corinthians:
  1:
    1: "Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our\
      \ brother Sosthenes, \n"
    2: "² To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and\
      \ called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call\
      \ on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours: \n"
    3: "³ Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. '
    5: '⁵ For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech
      and with all knowledge— '
    6: '⁶ God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our
      Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. '
    8: '⁸ He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on
      the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. '
    9: "⁹ God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus\
      \ Christ our Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no
      divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. '
    11: '¹¹ My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me
      that there are quarrels among you. '
    12: "¹² What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow\
      \ Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the
      name of Paul? '
    14: '¹⁴ I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, '
    15: '¹⁵ so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. '
    16: '¹⁶ (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t
      remember if I baptized anyone else.) '
    17: "¹⁷ For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with\
      \ wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
      but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. '
    19: "¹⁹ For it is written:\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;\n    the intelligence\
      \ of the intelligent I will frustrate.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the
      philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? '
    21: '²¹ For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know
      him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those
      who believe. '
    22: '²² Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, '
    23: '²³ but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness
      to Gentiles, '
    24: '²⁴ but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
      of God and the wisdom of God. '
    25: "²⁵ For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness\
      \ of God is stronger than human strength. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not
      many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many
      were of noble birth. '
    27: '²⁷ But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose
      the weak things of the world to shame the strong. '
    28: '²⁸ God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the
      things that are not—to nullify the things that are, '
    29: '²⁹ so that no one may boast before him. '
    30: '³⁰ It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for
      us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. '
    31: '³¹ Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”'
  2:
    1: 'And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not
      come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about
      God. '
    2: '² For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ
      and him crucified. '
    3: '³ I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. '
    4: '⁴ My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but
      with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, '
    5: "⁵ so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power. \n"
    6: '⁶ We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the
      wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. '
    7: '⁷ No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God
      destined for our glory before time began. '
    8: '⁸ None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would
      not have crucified the Lord of glory. '
    9: "⁹ However, as it is written:\n“What no eye has seen,\n    what no ear has\
      \ heard,\nand what no human mind has conceived”—\n    the things God has prepared\
      \ for those who love him— \n"
    10: "¹⁰ these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.\nThe Spirit\
      \ searches all things, even the deep things of God. "
    11: '¹¹ For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them?
      In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. '
    12: '¹² What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who
      is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. '
    13: '¹³ This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words
      taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. '
    14: '¹⁴ The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from
      the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them
      because they are discerned only through the Spirit. '
    15: '¹⁵ The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such
      a person is not subject to merely human judgments, '
    16: "¹⁶ for,\n“Who has known the mind of the Lord\n    so as to instruct him?”\n\
      But we have the mind of Christ."
  3:
    1: 'Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit
      but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ. '
    2: '² I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed,
      you are still not ready. '
    3: '³ You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among
      you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? '
    4: "⁴ For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are\
      \ you not mere human beings? \n"
    5: '⁵ What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom
      you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. '
    6: '⁶ I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. '
    7: '⁷ So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only
      God, who makes things grow. '
    8: '⁸ The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will
      each be rewarded according to their own labor. '
    9: "⁹ For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder,
      and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. '
    11: '¹¹ For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which
      is Jesus Christ. '
    12: '¹² If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones,
      wood, hay or straw, '
    13: '¹³ their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it
      to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality
      of each person’s work. '
    14: '¹⁴ If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. '
    15: "¹⁵ If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even\
      \ though only as one escaping through the flames. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit
      dwells in your midst? '
    17: "¹⁷ If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s\
      \ temple is sacred, and you together are that temple. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards
      of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise. '
    19: '¹⁹ For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written:
      “He catches the wise in their craftiness”; '
    20: '²⁰ and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” '
    21: '²¹ So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, '
    22: '²² whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the
      present or the future—all are yours, '
    23: ²³ and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
  4:
    1: 'This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those
      entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed. '
    2: '² Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. '
    3: '³ I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed,
      I do not even judge myself. '
    4: '⁴ My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord
      who judges me. '
    5: "⁵ Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes.\
      \ He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives\
      \ of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos
      for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, “Do
      not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower
      of one of us over against the other. '
    7: "⁷ For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you\
      \ did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you\
      \ did not? \n"
    8: '⁸ Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun
      to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign
      so that we also might reign with you! '
    9: '⁹ For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of
      the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made
      a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings. '
    10: '¹⁰ We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but
      you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! '
    11: '¹¹ To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally
      treated, we are homeless. '
    12: '¹² We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we
      are persecuted, we endure it; '
    13: "¹³ when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the\
      \ earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children. '
    15: '¹⁵ Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many
      fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore I urge you to imitate me. '
    17: "¹⁷ For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is\
      \ faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus,\
      \ which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. '
    19: '¹⁹ But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will
      find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they
      have. '
    20: '²⁰ For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. '
    21: ²¹ What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall
      I come in love and with a gentle spirit?
  5:
    1: 'It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of
      a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s
      wife. '
    2: '² And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have
      put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? '
    3: '³ For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit.
      As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in
      the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. '
    4: '⁴ So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of
      our Lord Jesus is present, '
    5: "⁵ hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his\
      \ spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the
      whole batch of dough? '
    7: '⁷ Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you
      really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with\
      \ malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— '
    10: '¹⁰ not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy
      and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. '
    11: "¹¹ But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who\
      \ claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater\
      \ or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. \n"
    12: '¹² What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you
      not to judge those inside? '
    13: ¹³ God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”
  6:
    1: 'If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the
      ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people? '
    2: '² Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you
      are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? '
    3: '³ Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this
      life! '
    4: '⁴ Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling
      from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? '
    5: '⁵ I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise
      enough to judge a dispute between believers? '
    6: "⁶ But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers!\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely
      defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? '
    8: '⁸ Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers
      and sisters. '
    9: '⁹ Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?
      Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers
      nor men who have sex with men '
    10: '¹⁰ nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers
      will inherit the kingdom of God. '
    11: "¹¹ And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified,\
      \ you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit\
      \ of our God. \n"
    12: '¹² “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial.
      “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered by anything. '
    13: '¹³ You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will
      destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but
      for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. '
    14: '¹⁴ By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. '
    15: '¹⁵ Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall
      I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! '
    16: '¹⁶ Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with
      her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.” '
    17: "¹⁷ But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside
      the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. '
    19: '¹⁹ Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is
      in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; '
    20: ²⁰ you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
  7:
    1: 'Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual
      relations with a woman.” '
    2: '² But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations
      with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. '
    3: '³ The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the
      wife to her husband. '
    4: '⁴ The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her
      husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body
      but yields it to his wife. '
    5: '⁵ Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time,
      so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that
      Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. '
    6: '⁶ I say this as a concession, not as a command. '
    7: "⁷ I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from\
      \ God; one has this gift, another has that. \n"
    8: '⁸ Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried,
      as I do. '
    9: "⁹ But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better\
      \ to marry than to burn with passion. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must
      not separate from her husband. '
    11: "¹¹ But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her\
      \ husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. \n"
    12: '¹² To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who
      is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. '
    13: '¹³ And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to
      live with her, she must not divorce him. '
    14: "¹⁴ For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and\
      \ the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise\
      \ your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister
      is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. '
    16: "¹⁶ How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do\
      \ you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation
      the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule
      I lay down in all the churches. '
    18: '¹⁸ Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become
      uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be
      circumcised. '
    19: '¹⁹ Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands
      is what counts. '
    20: "²⁰ Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called\
      \ them. \n"
    21: '²¹ Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although
      if you can gain your freedom, do so. '
    22: '²² For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s
      freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave. '
    23: '²³ You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. '
    24: "²⁴ Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain\
      \ in the situation they were in when God called them. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment
      as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. '
    26: '²⁶ Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain
      as he is. '
    27: '²⁷ Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from
      such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. '
    28: "²⁸ But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she\
      \ has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life,\
      \ and I want to spare you this. \n"
    29: '²⁹ What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now
      on those who have wives should live as if they do not; '
    30: '³⁰ those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were
      not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; '
    31: "³¹ those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For\
      \ this world in its present form is passing away. \n"
    32: '³² I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned
      about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. '
    33: '³³ But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he
      can please his wife— '
    34: '³⁴ and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned
      about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body
      and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how
      she can please her husband. '
    35: "³⁵ I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you\
      \ may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. \n"
    36: '³⁶ If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the
      virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he
      ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get
      married. '
    37: '³⁷ But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no
      compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not
      to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. '
    38: "³⁸ So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry\
      \ her does better. \n"
    39: '³⁹ A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband
      dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. '
    40: ⁴⁰ In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that
      I too have the Spirit of God.
  8:
    1: 'Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.”
      But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. '
    2: '² Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. '
    3: "³ But whoever loves God is known by God. \n"
    4: '⁴ So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is
      nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.” '
    5: '⁵ For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as
      indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), '
    6: "⁶ yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and\
      \ for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all\
      \ things came and through whom we live. \n"
    7: '⁷ But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed
      to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been
      sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. '
    8: "⁸ But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat,\
      \ and no better if we do. \n"
    9: '⁹ Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a
      stumbling block to the weak. '
    10: '¹⁰ For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge,
      eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed
      to idols? '
    11: '¹¹ So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by
      your knowledge. '
    12: '¹² When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience,
      you sin against Christ. '
    13: ¹³ Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin,
      I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
  9:
    1: 'Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you
      not the result of my work in the Lord? '
    2: "² Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you\
      \ are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. \n"
    3: '³ This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. '
    4: '⁴ Don’t we have the right to food and drink? '
    5: '⁵ Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the
      other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? '
    6: "⁶ Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does
      not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk? '
    8: '⁸ Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? '
    9: '⁹ For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is
      treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned? '
    10: '¹⁰ Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us,
      because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing
      in the harvest. '
    11: '¹¹ If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a
      material harvest from you? '
    12: "¹² If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all\
      \ the more?\nBut we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with\
      \ anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. \n"
    13: '¹³ Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from
      the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on
      the altar? '
    14: "¹⁴ In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel\
      \ should receive their living from the gospel. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in
      the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow
      anyone to deprive me of this boast. '
    16: '¹⁶ For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to
      preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! '
    17: '¹⁷ If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply
      discharging the trust committed to me. '
    18: "¹⁸ What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may\
      \ offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher\
      \ of the gospel. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone,
      to win as many as possible. '
    20: '²⁰ To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law
      I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as
      to win those under the law. '
    21: '²¹ To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though
      I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those
      not having the law. '
    22: '²² To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to
      all people so that by all possible means I might save some. '
    23: "²³ I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets
      the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. '
    25: '²⁵ Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do
      it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will
      last forever. '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight
      like a boxer beating the air. '
    27: ²⁷ No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have
      preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
  10:
    1: 'For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that
      our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the
      sea. '
    2: '² They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. '
    3: '³ They all ate the same spiritual food '
    4: '⁴ and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock
      that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. '
    5: "⁵ Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered\
      \ in the wilderness. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts
      on evil things as they did. '
    7: '⁷ Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people
      sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.” '
    8: '⁸ We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day
      twenty-three thousand of them died. '
    9: '⁹ We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes. '
    10: "¹⁰ And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying\
      \ angel. \n"
    11: '¹¹ These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings
      for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. '
    12: '¹² So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall! '
    13: "¹³ No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And\
      \ God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.\
      \ But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure\
      \ it. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. '
    15: '¹⁵ I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. '
    16: '¹⁶ Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation
      in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in
      the body of Christ? '
    17: "¹⁷ Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all\
      \ share the one loaf. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate
      in the altar? '
    19: '¹⁹ Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an
      idol is anything? '
    20: '²⁰ No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and
      I do not want you to be participants with demons. '
    21: '²¹ You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot
      have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons. '
    22: "²² Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial.
      “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive. '
    24: "²⁴ No one should seek their own good, but the good of others. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, '
    26: "²⁶ for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever
      is put before you without raising questions of conscience. '
    28: '²⁸ But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then
      do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of
      conscience. '
    29: '²⁹ I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is
      my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? '
    30: "³⁰ If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because\
      \ of something I thank God for? \n"
    31: '³¹ So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory
      of God. '
    32: '³² Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of
      God— '
    33: ³³ even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my
      own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
  11:
    1: "¹ Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. \n"
    2: '² I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions
      just as I passed them on to you. '
    3: '³ But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the
      head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. '
    4: '⁴ Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. '
    5: '⁵ But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors
      her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. '
    6: "⁶ For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair\
      \ cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her\
      \ head shaved, then she should cover her head. \n"
    7: '⁷ A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God;
      but woman is the glory of man. '
    8: '⁸ For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; '
    9: '⁹ neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. '
    10: '¹⁰ It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own
      head, because of the angels. '
    11: '¹¹ Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man
      independent of woman. '
    12: "¹² For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything\
      \ comes from God. \n"
    13: '¹³ Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her
      head uncovered? '
    14: '¹⁴ Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair,
      it is a disgrace to him, '
    15: '¹⁵ but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given
      to her as a covering. '
    16: "¹⁶ If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor\
      \ do the churches of God. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings
      do more harm than good. '
    18: '¹⁸ In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there
      are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. '
    19: '¹⁹ No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have
      God’s approval. '
    20: '²⁰ So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, '
    21: '²¹ for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers.
      As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. '
    22: "²² Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church\
      \ of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall\
      \ I praise you? Certainly not in this matter! \n"
    23: '²³ For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus,
      on the night he was betrayed, took bread, '
    24: '²⁴ and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body,
      which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” '
    25: '²⁵ In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the
      new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of
      me.” '
    26: "²⁶ For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s\
      \ death until he comes. \n"
    27: '²⁷ So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy
      manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and
      drink from the cup. '
    29: '²⁹ For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat
      and drink judgment on themselves. '
    30: '³⁰ That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have
      fallen asleep. '
    31: '³¹ But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not
      come under such judgment. '
    32: "³² Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being\
      \ disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world. \n"
    33: '³³ So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all
      eat together. '
    34: "³⁴ Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet\
      \ together it may not result in judgment.\nAnd when I come I will give further\
      \ directions."
  12:
    1: 'Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you
      to be uninformed. '
    2: '² You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced
      and led astray to mute idols. '
    3: "³ Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of\
      \ God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by\
      \ the Holy Spirit. \n"
    4: '⁴ There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. '
    5: '⁵ There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. '
    6: "⁶ There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone\
      \ it is the same God at work. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common
      good. '
    8: '⁸ To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another
      a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, '
    9: '⁹ to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that
      one Spirit, '
    10: '¹⁰ to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing
      between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still
      another the interpretation of tongues. '
    11: "¹¹ All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes\
      \ them to each one, just as he determines. \n"
    12: '¹² Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form
      one body, so it is with Christ. '
    13: '¹³ For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether
      Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. '
    14: "¹⁴ Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong
      to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. '
    16: '¹⁶ And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to
      the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. '
    17: '¹⁷ If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If
      the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? '
    18: '¹⁸ But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just
      as he wanted them to be. '
    19: '¹⁹ If they were all one part, where would the body be? '
    20: "²⁰ As it is, there are many parts, but one body. \n"
    21: '²¹ The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot
      say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” '
    22: '²² On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, '
    23: '²³ and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor.
      And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, '
    24: '²⁴ while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put
      the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, '
    25: '²⁵ so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should
      have equal concern for each other. '
    26: "²⁶ If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored,\
      \ every part rejoices with it. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. '
    28: '²⁸ And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets,
      third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance,
      and of different kinds of tongues. '
    29: '²⁹ Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? '
    30: '³⁰ Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? '
    31: "³¹ Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.\nAnd yet I will show you the most\
      \ excellent way."
  13:
    1: 'If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am
      only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. '
    2: '² If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
      and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. '
    3: "³ If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that\
      \ I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. \n"
    4: '⁴ Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is
      not proud. '
    5: '⁵ It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,
      it keeps no record of wrongs. '
    6: '⁶ Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. '
    7: "⁷ It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. \n"
    8: '⁸ Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where
      there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass
      away. '
    9: '⁹ For we know in part and we prophesy in part, '
    10: '¹⁰ but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. '
    11: '¹¹ When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned
      like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. '
    12: "¹² For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face\
      \ to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of
      these is love.'
  14:
    1: 'Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially
      prophecy. '
    2: '² For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed,
      no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. '
    3: '³ But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging
      and comfort. '
    4: '⁴ Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies
      edifies the church. '
    5: "⁵ I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have\
      \ you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in\
      \ tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good
      will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy
      or word of instruction? '
    7: '⁷ Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or
      harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction
      in the notes? '
    8: '⁸ Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for
      battle? '
    9: '⁹ So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue,
      how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the
      air. '
    10: '¹⁰ Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of
      them is without meaning. '
    11: '¹¹ If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner
      to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. '
    12: "¹² So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to\
      \ excel in those that build up the church. \n"
    13: '¹³ For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may
      interpret what they say. '
    14: '¹⁴ For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. '
    15: '¹⁵ So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with
      my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else,
      who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving,
      since they do not know what you are saying? '
    17: "¹⁷ You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. '
    19: "¹⁹ But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct\
      \ others than ten thousand words in a tongue. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be
      infants, but in your thinking be adults. '
    21: "²¹ In the Law it is written:\n“With other tongues\n    and through the lips\
      \ of foreigners\nI will speak to this people,\n    but even then they will not\
      \ listen to me,\nsays the Lord.” \n"
    22: '²² Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy,
      however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. '
    23: '²³ So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues,
      and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of
      your mind? '
    24: '²⁴ But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying,
      they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, '
    25: "²⁵ as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and\
      \ worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!” \n"
    26: '²⁶ What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together,
      each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or
      an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. '
    27: '²⁷ If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one
      at a time, and someone must interpret. '
    28: "²⁸ If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church\
      \ and speak to himself and to God. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully
      what is said. '
    30: '³⁰ And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker
      should stop. '
    31: '³¹ For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and
      encouraged. '
    32: '³² The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. '
    33: "³³ For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations\
      \ of the Lord’s people. \n"
    34: '³⁴ Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak,
      but must be in submission, as the law says. '
    35: "³⁵ If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands\
      \ at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people
      it has reached? '
    37: '³⁷ If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit,
      let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. '
    38: "³⁸ But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid
      speaking in tongues. '
    40: ⁴⁰ But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
  15:
    1: 'Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to
      you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. '
    2: "² By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached\
      \ to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. \n"
    3: '³ For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ
      died for our sins according to the Scriptures, '
    4: '⁴ that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the
      Scriptures, '
    5: '⁵ and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. '
    6: '⁶ After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters
      at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. '
    7: '⁷ Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, '
    8: "⁸ and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. \n"
    9: '⁹ For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called
      an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. '
    10: '¹⁰ But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without
      effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God
      that was with me. '
    11: "¹¹ Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what\
      \ you believed. \n"
    12: '¹² But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can
      some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? '
    13: '¹³ If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been
      raised. '
    14: '¹⁴ And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is
      your faith. '
    15: '¹⁵ More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for
      we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did
      not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. '
    16: '¹⁶ For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. '
    17: '¹⁷ And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still
      in your sins. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. '
    19: "¹⁹ If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most\
      \ to be pitied. \n"
    20: '²⁰ But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those
      who have fallen asleep. '
    21: '²¹ For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes
      also through a man. '
    22: '²² For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. '
    23: '²³ But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those
      who belong to him. '
    24: '²⁴ Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father
      after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. '
    25: '²⁵ For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. '
    26: '²⁶ The last enemy to be destroyed is death. '
    27: '²⁷ For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything”
      has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself,
      who put everything under Christ. '
    28: "²⁸ When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him\
      \ who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for
      the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? '
    30: '³⁰ And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? '
    31: '³¹ I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ
      Jesus our Lord. '
    32: "³² If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what\
      \ have I gained? If the dead are not raised,\n“Let us eat and drink,\n    for\
      \ tomorrow we die.” \n"
    33: '³³ Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.” '
    34: "³⁴ Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are\
      \ some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame. \n"
    35: '³⁵ But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body
      will they come?” '
    36: '³⁶ How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. '
    37: '³⁷ When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed,
      perhaps of wheat or of something else. '
    38: '³⁸ But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed
      he gives its own body. '
    39: '³⁹ Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have
      another, birds another and fish another. '
    40: '⁴⁰ There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor
      of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is
      another. '
    41: "⁴¹ The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another;\
      \ and star differs from star in splendor. \n"
    42: '⁴² So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown
      is perishable, it is raised imperishable; '
    43: '⁴³ it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness,
      it is raised in power; '
    44: "⁴⁴ it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\nIf there is\
      \ a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. "
    45: '⁴⁵ So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last
      Adam, a life-giving spirit. '
    46: '⁴⁶ The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the
      spiritual. '
    47: '⁴⁷ The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. '
    48: '⁴⁸ As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the
      heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. '
    49: "⁴⁹ And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear\
      \ the image of the heavenly man. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
      the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. '
    51: '⁵¹ Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be
      changed— '
    52: '⁵² in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
      will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. '
    53: '⁵³ For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal
      with immortality. '
    54: "⁵⁴ When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal\
      \ with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has\
      \ been swallowed up in victory.” \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ “Where, O death, is your victory?\n    Where, O death, is your sting?”\
      \ \n"
    56: '⁵⁶ The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. '
    57: "⁵⁷ But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\
      \ \n"
    58: ⁵⁸ Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you.
      Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that
      your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
  16:
    1: 'Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian
      churches to do. '
    2: '² On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of
      money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections
      will have to be made. '
    3: '³ Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you
      approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. '
    4: "⁴ If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me. \n"
    5: '⁵ After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through
      Macedonia. '
    6: '⁶ Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that
      you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. '
    7: '⁷ For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to
      spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. '
    8: '⁸ But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, '
    9: "⁹ because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are\
      \ many who oppose me. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is
      with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. '
    11: "¹¹ No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace\
      \ so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. \n"
    12: "¹² Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with\
      \ the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has\
      \ the opportunity. \n"
    13: '¹³ Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. '
    14: "¹⁴ Do everything in love. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia,
      and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge
      you, brothers and sisters, '
    16: '¹⁶ to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors
      at it. '
    17: '¹⁷ I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they
      have supplied what was lacking from you. '
    18: "¹⁸ For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla
      greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. '
    20: "²⁰ All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another\
      \ with a holy kiss. \n"
    21: "²¹ I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. \n"
    22: "²² If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord!\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. \n"
    24: ²⁴ My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
