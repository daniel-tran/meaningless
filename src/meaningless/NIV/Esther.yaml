Esther:
  1:
    1: 'This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled over
      127 provinces stretching from India to Cush: '
    2: '² At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of
      Susa, '
    3: "³ and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles\
      \ and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and\
      \ the nobles of the provinces were present. \n"
    4: '⁴ For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the
      splendor and glory of his majesty. '
    5: '⁵ When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days,
      in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least
      to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa. '
    6: '⁶ The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of
      white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were
      couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl
      and other costly stones. '
    7: '⁷ Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and
      the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality. '
    8: "⁸ By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions,\
      \ for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King\
      \ Xerxes. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he
      commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha,
      Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas— '
    11: '¹¹ to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to
      display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at. '
    12: "¹² But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused\
      \ to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger. \n"
    13: '¹³ Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law
      and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times '
    14: "¹⁴ and were closest to the king—Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,\
      \ Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special\
      \ access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She\
      \ has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen
      Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles
      and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they
      will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to
      be brought before him, but she would not come.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard\
      \ about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same\
      \ way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let
      it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that
      Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king
      give her royal position to someone else who is better than she. '
    20: "²⁰ Then when the king’s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm,\
      \ all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did
      as Memukan proposed. '
    22: ²² He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its
      own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every
      man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue.
  2:
    1: 'Later when King Xerxes’ fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she
      had done and what he had decreed about her. '
    2: '² Then the king’s personal attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for
      beautiful young virgins for the king. '
    3: '³ Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring
      all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them
      be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the
      women; and let beauty treatments be given to them. '
    4: "⁴ Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.”\
      \ This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it. \n"
    5: '⁵ Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named
      Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, '
    6: '⁶ who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she\
      \ had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther,\
      \ had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter\
      \ when her father and mother died. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were
      brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also
      was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the
      harem. '
    9: "⁹ She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her\
      \ beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants\
      \ selected from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants into the\
      \ best place in the harem. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because
      Mordecai had forbidden her to do so. '
    11: "¹¹ Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to\
      \ find out how Esther was and what was happening to her. \n"
    12: '¹² Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete
      twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with
      oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. '
    13: '¹³ And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given
      her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. '
    14: "¹⁴ In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another\
      \ part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge\
      \ of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased\
      \ with her and summoned her by name. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the
      daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other
      than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested.
      And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her. '
    16: "¹⁶ She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month,\
      \ the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women,
      and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he
      set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. '
    18: "¹⁸ And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles\
      \ and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed\
      \ gifts with royal liberality. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at
      the king’s gate. '
    20: "²⁰ But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just\
      \ as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions\
      \ as she had done when he was bringing her up. \n"
    21: '²¹ During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana and
      Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and
      conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. '
    22: '²² But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn
      reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai. '
    23: ²³ And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials
      were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the
      presence of the king.
  3:
    1: 'After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
      elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other
      nobles. '
    2: "² All the royal officials at the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to\
      \ Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would\
      \ not kneel down or pay him honor. \n"
    3: '³ Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you
      disobey the king’s command?” '
    4: "⁴ Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they\
      \ told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated,\
      \ for he had told them he was a Jew. \n"
    5: '⁵ When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was
      enraged. '
    6: "⁶ Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing\
      \ only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people,\
      \ the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes. \n"
    7: "⁷ In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan,\
      \ the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day\
      \ and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among
      the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate.
      Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not
      obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. '
    9: "⁹ If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will\
      \ give ten thousand talents of silver to the king’s administrators for the royal\
      \ treasury.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman
      son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. '
    11: "¹¹ “Keep the money,” the king said to Haman, “and do with the people as you\
      \ please.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were
      summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language
      of each people all Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of the
      various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written
      in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring. '
    13: '¹³ Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with the
      order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and
      children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month
      of Adar, and to plunder their goods. '
    14: "¹⁴ A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province\
      \ and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for\
      \ that day. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ The couriers went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict
      was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but
      the city of Susa was bewildered.
  4:
    1: 'When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put
      on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. '
    2: '² But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth
      was allowed to enter it. '
    3: "³ In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was\
      \ great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay\
      \ in sackcloth and ashes. \n"
    4: '⁴ When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai,
      she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his
      sackcloth, but he would not accept them. '
    5: "⁵ Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend\
      \ her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why. \n"
    6: '⁶ So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of
      the king’s gate. '
    7: '⁷ Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact
      amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction
      of the Jews. '
    8: "⁸ He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation,\
      \ which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her,\
      \ and he told him to instruct her to go into the king’s presence to beg for\
      \ mercy and plead with him for her people. \n"
    9: '⁹ Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai, '
    11: "¹¹ “All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that\
      \ for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being\
      \ summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king\
      \ extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have\
      \ passed since I was called to go to the king.” \n"
    12: '¹² When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai, '
    13: '¹³ he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s
      house you alone of all the Jews will escape. '
    14: "¹⁴ For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the\
      \ Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will\
      \ perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such\
      \ a time as this?” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: '
    16: "¹⁶ “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do\
      \ not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast\
      \ as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against\
      \ the law. And if I perish, I perish.” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions.
  5:
    1: 'On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court
      of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal
      throne in the hall, facing the entrance. '
    2: "² When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her\
      \ and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached\
      \ and touched the tip of the scepter. \n"
    3: "³ Then the king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even\
      \ up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “If it pleases the king,” replied Esther, “let the king, together with Haman,\
      \ come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.” \n"
    5: "⁵ “Bring Haman at once,” the king said, “so that we may do what Esther asks.”\n\
      So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. "
    6: "⁶ As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, “Now what is your\
      \ petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half\
      \ the kingdom, it will be granted.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this: '
    8: "⁸ If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my\
      \ petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the\
      \ banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai
      at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his
      presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai. '
    10: "¹⁰ Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home.\nCalling together\
      \ his friends and Zeresh, his wife, "
    11: '¹¹ Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the
      ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles
      and officials. '
    12: '¹² “And that’s not all,” Haman added. “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited
      to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along
      with the king tomorrow. '
    13: "¹³ But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai\
      \ sitting at the king’s gate.” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching
      to a height of fifty cubits, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai
      impaled on it. Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself.” This
      suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the pole set up.
  6:
    1: 'That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles,
      the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. '
    2: "² It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh,\
      \ two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate\
      \ King Xerxes. \n"
    3: "³ “What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked.\n\
      “Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered. \n"
    4: "⁴ The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer\
      \ court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole\
      \ he had set up for him. \n"
    5: "⁵ His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.”\n“Bring him in,”\
      \ the king ordered. \n"
    6: "⁶ When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man\
      \ the king delights to honor?”\nNow Haman thought to himself, “Who is there\
      \ that the king would rather honor than me?” "
    7: '⁷ So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor, '
    8: '⁸ have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has
      ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. '
    9: "⁹ Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble\
      \ princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on\
      \ the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what\
      \ is done for the man the king delights to honor!’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and\
      \ do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s\
      \ gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on\
      \ horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what\
      \ is done for the man the king delights to honor!” \n"
    12: '¹² Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home,
      with his head covered in grief, '
    13: "¹³ and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened\
      \ to him.\nHis advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before\
      \ whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against\
      \ him—you will surely come to ruin!” "
    14: ¹⁴ While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and
      hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.
  7:
    1: 'So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet, '
    2: "² and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked,\
      \ “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request?\
      \ Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.” \n"
    3: '³ Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty,
      and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this
      is my request. '
    4: "⁴ For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated.\
      \ If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet,\
      \ because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.” \n"
    5: "⁵ King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has\
      \ dared to do such a thing?” \n"
    6: "⁶ Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!”\nThen Haman was\
      \ terrified before the king and queen. "
    7: "⁷ The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden.\
      \ But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind\
      \ to beg Queen Esther for his life. \n"
    8: "⁸ Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman\
      \ was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.\nThe king exclaimed,\
      \ “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?”\nAs soon\
      \ as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. "
    9: "⁹ Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching\
      \ to a height of fifty cubits stands by Haman’s house. He had it set up for\
      \ Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.”\nThe king said, “Impale him on it!” "
    10: ¹⁰ So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the
      king’s fury subsided.
  8:
    1: 'That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy
      of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had
      told how he was related to her. '
    2: "² The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and\
      \ presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate. \n"
    3: '³ Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She
      begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had
      devised against the Jews. '
    4: "⁴ Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood\
      \ before him. \n"
    5: '⁵ “If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and
      thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order
      be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
      devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces. '
    6: "⁶ For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to\
      \ see the destruction of my family?” \n"
    7: '⁷ King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman
      attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled
      him on the pole he set up. '
    8: "⁸ Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems\
      \ best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written\
      \ in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.” \n"
    9: '⁹ At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the
      third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the
      Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching
      from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province
      and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and
      language. '
    10: "¹⁰ Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with\
      \ the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses\
      \ especially bred for the king. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble
      and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any
      nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,
      and to plunder the property of their enemies. '
    12: '¹² The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King
      Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. '
    13: "¹³ A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province\
      \ and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be\
      \ ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s\
      \ command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When Mordecai left the king’s presence, he was wearing royal garments
      of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And
      the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. '
    16: '¹⁶ For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. '
    17: ¹⁷ In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came,
      there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And
      many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had
      seized them.
  9:
    1: 'On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded
      by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped
      to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper
      hand over those who hated them. '
    2: '² The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to
      attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because
      the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them. '
    3: '³ And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the
      king’s administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them. '
    4: "⁴ Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the\
      \ provinces, and he became more and more powerful. \n"
    5: '⁵ The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying
      them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. '
    6: '⁶ In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. '
    7: '⁷ They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, '
    8: '⁸ Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, '
    9: '⁹ Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, '
    10: "¹⁰ the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they\
      \ did not lay their hands on the plunder. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the
      king that same day. '
    12: "¹² The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five\
      \ hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they\
      \ done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will\
      \ be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission\
      \ to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled\
      \ on poles.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa,
      and they impaled the ten sons of Haman. '
    15: "¹⁵ The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar,\
      \ and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their\
      \ hands on the plunder. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces
      also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They
      killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder. '
    17: "¹⁷ This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth\
      \ they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth,\
      \ and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ That is why rural Jews—those living in villages—observe the fourteenth\
      \ of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents\
      \ to each other. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout
      the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, '
    21: '²¹ to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the
      month of Adar '
    22: "²² as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month\
      \ when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration.\
      \ He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents\
      \ of food to one another and gifts to the poor. \n"
    23: '²³ So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what
      Mordecai had written to them. '
    24: '²⁴ For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had
      plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the
      lot) for their ruin and destruction. '
    25: '²⁵ But when the plot came to the king’s attention, he issued written orders
      that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto
      his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles. '
    26: '²⁶ (Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Because of
      everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what
      had happened to them, '
    27: '²⁷ the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their
      descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days
      every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed. '
    28: "²⁸ These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every\
      \ family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should\
      \ never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days\
      \ die out among their descendants. \n"
    29: '²⁹ So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote
      with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. '
    30: '³⁰ And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’
      kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance— '
    31: '³¹ to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai
      the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for
      themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation. '
    32: ³² Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written
      down in the records.
  10:
    1: 'King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores. '
    2: '² And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the
      greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the
      book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia? '
    3: ³ Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the
      Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for
      the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.
