Malachi:
  1:
    1: "A prophecy: The word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi. \n"
    2: "² “I have loved you,” says the Lord.\n“But you ask, ‘How have you loved us?’\n\
      “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the Lord. “Yet I have loved Jacob, "
    3: "³ but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland\
      \ and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Edom may say, “Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.”\n\
      But this is what the Lord Almighty says: “They may build, but I will demolish.\
      \ They will be called the Wicked Land, a people always under the wrath of the\
      \ Lord. "
    5: "⁵ You will see it with your own eyes and say, ‘Great is the Lord—even beyond\
      \ the borders of Israel!’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “A son honors his father, and a slave his master. If I am a father, where\
      \ is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?” says\
      \ the Lord Almighty.\n“It is you priests who show contempt for my name.\n“But\
      \ you ask, ‘How have we shown contempt for your name?’ \n"
    7: "⁷ “By offering defiled food on my altar.\n“But you ask, ‘How have we defiled\
      \ you?’\n“By saying that the Lord’s table is contemptible. "
    8: "⁸ When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you\
      \ sacrifice lame or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to\
      \ your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?” says the\
      \ Lord Almighty. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Now plead with God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your\
      \ hands, will he accept you?”—says the Lord Almighty. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not
      light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you,” says the Lord Almighty,
      “and I will accept no offering from your hands. '
    11: "¹¹ My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where\
      \ it sets. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to me,\
      \ because my name will be great among the nations,” says the Lord Almighty.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² “But you profane it by saying, ‘The Lord’s table is defiled,’ and, ‘Its
      food is contemptible.’ '
    13: "¹³ And you say, ‘What a burden!’ and you sniff at it contemptuously,” says\
      \ the Lord Almighty.\n“When you bring injured, lame or diseased animals and\
      \ offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?” says the\
      \ Lord. "
    14: ¹⁴ “Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to
      give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great
      king,” says the Lord Almighty, “and my name is to be feared among the nations.
  2:
    1: '“And now, you priests, this warning is for you. '
    2: "² If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,” says\
      \ the Lord Almighty, “I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings.\
      \ Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ “Because of you I will rebuke your descendants; I will smear on your faces
      the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it. '
    4: '⁴ And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant
      with Levi may continue,” says the Lord Almighty. '
    5: '⁵ “My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them
      to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. '
    6: "⁶ True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips.\
      \ He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin. \n"
    7: '⁷ “For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the
      messenger of the Lord Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth. '
    8: '⁸ But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to
      stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,” says the Lord Almighty. '
    9: "⁹ “So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people,\
      \ because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters\
      \ of the law.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do we not all have one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane\
      \ the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another? \n"
    11: '¹¹ Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel
      and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying
      women who worship a foreign god. '
    12: "¹² As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord remove him\
      \ from the tents of Jacob—even though he brings an offering to the Lord Almighty.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Another thing you do: You flood the Lord’s altar with tears. You weep
      and wail because he no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts
      them with pleasure from your hands. '
    14: "¹⁴ You ask, “Why?” It is because the Lord is the witness between you and\
      \ the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your\
      \ partner, the wife of your marriage covenant. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And\
      \ what does the one God seek? Godly offspring. So be on your guard, and do not\
      \ be unfaithful to the wife of your youth. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “The man who hates and divorces his wife,” says the Lord, the God of Israel,\
      \ “does violence to the one he should protect,” says the Lord Almighty.\nSo\
      \ be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You have wearied the Lord with your words.\n“How have we wearied him?”\
      \ you ask.\nBy saying, “All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord, and\
      \ he is pleased with them” or “Where is the God of justice?”"
  3:
    1: "“I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly\
      \ the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant,\
      \ whom you desire, will come,” says the Lord Almighty. \n"
    2: '² But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears?
      For he will be like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap. '
    3: '³ He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites
      and refine them like gold and silver. Then the Lord will have men who will bring
      offerings in righteousness, '
    4: "⁴ and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the Lord,\
      \ as in days gone by, as in former years. \n"
    5: "⁵ “So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against\
      \ sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of\
      \ their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners\
      \ among you of justice, but do not fear me,” says the Lord Almighty. \n"
    6: '⁶ “I the Lord do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed. '
    7: "⁷ Ever since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees\
      \ and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the\
      \ Lord Almighty.\n“But you ask, ‘How are we to return?’ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob me.\n“But you ask, ‘How are we\
      \ robbing you?’\n“In tithes and offerings. "
    9: '⁹ You are under a curse—your whole nation—because you are robbing me. '
    10: '¹⁰ Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my
      house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw
      open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will
      not be room enough to store it. '
    11: '¹¹ I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your
      fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the Lord Almighty. '
    12: "¹² “Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful\
      \ land,” says the Lord Almighty. \n"
    13: "¹³ “You have spoken arrogantly against me,” says the Lord.\n“Yet you ask,\
      \ ‘What have we said against you?’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying
      out his requirements and going about like mourners before the Lord Almighty? '
    15: "¹⁵ But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper, and\
      \ even when they put God to the test, they get away with it.’” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the Lord listened\
      \ and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning\
      \ those who feared the Lord and honored his name. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “On the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty, “they will be my treasured
      possession. I will spare them, just as a father has compassion and spares his
      son who serves him. '
    18: ¹⁸ And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked,
      between those who serve God and those who do not.
  4:
    1: '“Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and
      every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on
      fire,” says the Lord Almighty. “Not a root or a branch will be left to them. '
    2: '² But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with
      healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves. '
    3: "³ Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles\
      \ of your feet on the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at\
      \ Horeb for all Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ “See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful
      day of the Lord comes. '
    6: ⁶ He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts
      of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with
      total destruction.”
